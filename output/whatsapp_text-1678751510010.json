We’re mindful that just as we’ve celebrated the start to 2023 through private texts or calls, there are many people who continue to be denied the ability to reach their loved ones because of internet shutdowns. To help, today we’re launching proxy support for WhatsApp users all over the world. What this means is we’re putting the power into people’s hands to maintain access to WhatsApp if their connection is blocked or disrupted.Choosing a proxy enables you to connect to WhatsApp through servers set up by volunteers and organizations around the world dedicated to helping people communicate freely. If you have the ability to help others connect, you can learn how to set up a proxy here.Connecting via proxy maintains the high level of privacy and security that WhatsApp provides. Your personal messages will still be protected by end-to-end encryption — ensuring they stay between you and the person you’re communicating with and are not visible to anyone in between, not the proxy servers, WhatsApp, or Meta. Our wish for 2023 is that these internet shutdowns never occur. Disruptions like we’ve seen in Iran for months on end deny people’s human rights and cut people off from receiving urgent help. Though in case these shutdowns continue, we hope this solution helps people wherever there is a need for secure and reliable communication.This option is now available in the settings menu for everyone running the latest version of our app. More information about how to use this feature is here."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/end-to-end-encrypted-backups-on-whatsapp","date":"2023-01-04T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"End-to-End Encrypted Backups on WhatsApp","text":"Status is a popular way to share ephemeral updates with friends and close contacts on WhatsApp. They disappear in 24 hours and may include photos, videos, GIFs, text, and more.

This will save people from having to find phone numbers off websites or type a number into their contacts.We’ve built business search in a way that preserves people’s privacy. What you search for is processed in a way that cannot be linked back to your account. To start, we’re bringing the ability to search for a business to Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, and the UK where people can find companies using our WhatsApp Business Platform. In Brazil, search will help people find small businesses as well.MessageAs more businesses use WhatsApp, our first principle remains keeping people in control of their conversations. Getting this right is important for WhatsApp just as much as for the people and businesses that rely on us. Some of the recent businesses that have joined WhatsApp are helping people open a bank account, purchase their metro ticket and order groceries.BuyUltimately we want people to be able to make a secure payment right from a chat with their credit or debit card. We recently launched this experience in India and we’re excited to now be testing this in Brazil with multiple payment partners. This seamless checkout experience will be a game-changer for people and businesses looking to buy and sell on WhatsApp without having to go to a website, open another app or pay in person.These new experiences are part of making WhatsApp the best way for people to connect with their favorite businesses. We look forward to your feedback."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/communities-now-available","date":"2022-11-02T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Communities Now Available!","text":"As we shared earlier this year, we’ve been hard at work building Communities, a major update to how people will be able to connect on WhatsApp in the groups that matter to them. Today, we’re excited to announce we’ve started to roll out Communities on WhatsApp globally and this will be available to everyone over the next few months.Communities like neighborhoods, parents at a school, and workplaces can now connect multiple groups together under one umbrella to organize group conversations on WhatsApp. To get started, tap on the new communities tab at the top of your chats on Android and at the bottom on iOS. From there you can start a new Community from scratch or add existing groups.Once you’re in a community, you can easily switch between available groups to get the information you need, when you need it, and admins can send important updates to everyone in the CommunityWith Communities, we’re aiming to raise the bar for how organizations communicate with a level of privacy and security not found anywhere else. The alternatives available today require trusting apps or software companies with a copy of their messages - and we think they deserve the higher level of security provided by end-to-end encryption.Today we’re also releasing three more features we think users will be excited about: the ability to create in-chat polls, 32 person video calling, and groups with up to 1024 users. Just like emoji reactions, larger file sharing, and admin delete, these features can be used in any group but will be particularly helpful for Communities.We’ve been working with over 50 organizations in 15 countries to build Communities to meet their needs. We’re excited that the feedback we’ve heard so far is these new tools are helping groups like these better organize and achieve their goals. There’s a lot more we plan to build and we’ll keep adding features over the coming months. For now, we’re excited to get this into more people’s hands and hear your feedback too."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-features-for-more-privacy-more-protection-more-control","date":"2022-08-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"New Features for More Privacy, More Protection, More Control","text":"At WhatsApp, Privacy is in our DNA, and we will never stop building new ways to protect your personal conversations.

Today, we’re excited to bring several new privacy features that provide even more layers of protection and give you more control over your messages.

Since WhatsApp launched in 2009, we've been focused on how we can help people have the next best thing to an in-person conversation when they want to talk to an individual or a group of friends or family. We also frequently hear from people who are using WhatsApp to communicate and coordinate within a community. Organizations like schools, local clubs, and non-profit organizations now rely on WhatsApp to communicate securely and get things done — especially since the pandemic forced us all to find creative ways to work together while apart. Given lots of feedback we’ve received, we think there’s more we can do to make it easier to help people manage these busy conversations among these kinds of groups. Here’s where Communities comes in. Communities on WhatsApp will enable people to bring together separate groups under one umbrella with a structure that works for them. That way people can receive updates sent to the entire Community and easily organize smaller discussion groups on what matters to them. Communities will also contain powerful new tools for admins, including announcement messages that are sent to everyone and control over which groups can be included.We think Communities will make it easier for a school principal to bring all the parents of the school together to share must-read updates and set up groups about specific classes, extracurricular activities, or volunteer needs.We're also making a number of improvements to how groups work on WhatsApp — whether or not they are part of a Community. We think these will help people share in new ways and reduce overload in larger chats. These features are rolling out in the coming weeks so people can start trying them out even before Communities are ready. Reactions - Emoji reactions are coming to WhatsApp so people can quickly share their opinion without flooding chats with new messages.Admin Delete - Group admins will be able to remove errant or problematic messages from everyone’s chats.File Sharing – We’re increasing file sharing to support files up to 2 gigabytes so people can easily collaborate on projects. Larger Voice Calls – We’ll introduce one-tap voice calling for up to 32 people with all new design for those times when talking live is better than chatting.Communities are inherently private, which is why we will continue to protect messages with end-to-end encryption. This security technology has truly never been more necessary to protect people’s privacy and safety. Close knit groups — schools, members of a religious congregation, even businesses — very much want and need to be able to have secure and private conversations without WhatsApp monitoring their every word.

By keeping the design simple, we’ve made recording and sending a voice message as quick and easy as writing a text. Every day on WhatsApp, our users send 7 billion voice messages on average, all of which are protected by end-to-end encryption to keep them private and secure at all times.Today, we’re excited to announce new features that make the voice message experience on WhatsApp even better. These include:Out of Chat Playback: Listen to a voice message outside of the chat so you can multitask or read and respond to other messages.Pause/Resume Recording: When recording a voice message, you can now pause the recording and resume when ready, in case you’re interrupted or need to gather your thoughts.Waveform Visualization: Shows a visual representation of the sound on the voice message to help follow the recording. Draft Preview: Listen to your voice messages before sending them.Remember Playback: If you pause when listening to a voice message, you can pick up where you left off when you return to the chat. Fast Playback on Forwarded Messages: Play voice messages at 1.5x or 2x speeds to listen to messages faster on both regular and forwarded messages.Voice messages have made it quick and easy for people to have more expressive conversations. Showing emotion or excitement through voice is more natural than text, and in many situations, voice messages are the preferred form of communication on WhatsApp. It’s simple for anyone to use - for your family members who prefer to avoid typing, for your friends who love to tell stories, for your peers who need encouraging words, or for when you want to hear your partner's voice at the end of a long day. We’re excited for users to try these new features as they roll out in the coming weeks."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/more-control-and-privacy-with-default-disappearing-messages-and-multiple-durations","date":"2021-12-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"More Control and Privacy with Default Disappearing Messages and Multiple Durations","text":"Our mission is to connect the world privately. As more of our conversations move from face-to-face to digital, we acknowledge there is a certain magic in just sitting down with someone in-person, sharing your thoughts in confidence, knowing you are both connecting in private and in that moment. The freedom to be honest and vulnerable, knowing that conversation isn’t being recorded and stored somewhere forever.Deciding how long a message lasts should be in your hands. We’ve become accustomed to leaving a digital copy of just about everything we type without even thinking about it. It’s become the equivalent of a note taker following us around making a permanent record of everything we’ve said. This is why we introduced disappearing messages last year, and more recently a way for photos and videos to immediately disappear after being viewed once.Today we are excited to provide our users with more options to control their messages and how long they stick around, with default disappearing messages and multiple durations.WhatsApp users will now have the option to turn on disappearing messages by default for all new chats. When enabled, all new one-on-one chats you or another person start will be set to disappear at your chosen duration, and we've added a new option when creating a group chat that lets you turn it on for groups you create. This new feature is optional and does not change or delete any of your existing chats.We are also adding two new durations for disappearing messages: 24 hours and 90 days, as well as the existing option of 7 days.For people who choose to switch on default disappearing messages, we will display a message in your chats that tells people this is the default you’ve chosen. This makes clear it's nothing personal - it's a choice you've made about how you want to communicate with everyone on WhatsApp moving forward. Though of course, if you need a particular conversation to remain permanent, it’s easy to switch a chat back.Living apart from family and friends for over a year has made it clearer than ever that just because we can’t physically talk in person, it doesn’t mean we should have to sacrifice the privacy of our personal conversations. We believe disappearing messages along with end-to-end encryption are two crucial features that define what it means to be a private messaging service today, and bring us one step closer to the feeling of an in-personal conversation.To get started, go to your Privacy settings and select ‘Default Message Timer’.

Whether a business wants to work with a business solution provider or get support directly from Facebook in the future, these improvements will make it easier for more medium and larger businesses to have customer conversations on WhatsApp.Receive Additional Information from BusinessesAs more businesses come onto WhatsApp, we’re improving how businesses can communicate with their customers. For example, businesses were often limited to sending timely notifications, which made it difficult to follow up with customers outside of a 24-hour window. So now we’ll support more types of messages -- to let people know when an item is back in stock, for example. We’ve also seen how periodic updates from health authorities about responding to the pandemic have been helpful and we want to make this kind of service available for more types of conversations.Respond to Businesses in New WaysWe’re also rolling out new messaging features that can help people get business done faster. New list messages present a menu of up to 10 options so people no longer need to type out a response. Reply buttons will allow people to quickly make a selection from up to three options with just a quick tap that a business can set ahead of time through their WhatsApp Business API account.

We previously encountered a great deal of misinformation about this update and we continue to work hard to clear up any confusion.As a reminder, we’re building new ways to chat or shop with a business on WhatsApp that are entirely optional. Personal messages will always be end-to-end encrypted, so WhatsApp can’t read or listen to them.We’ve reflected on what we could have done better here. We want everyone to know our history of defending end-to-end encryption and trust we’re committed to protecting people’s privacy and security. We’re now using our Status feature to share our values and updates directly within WhatsApp. We’ll be doing much more to make our voice clear going forward.In the coming weeks, we’ll display a banner in WhatsApp providing more information that people can read at their own pace. We’ve also included more information to try and address concerns we’re hearing. Eventually, we’ll start reminding people to review and accept these updates to keep using WhatsApp.We also think it’s important people know how we can provide WhatsApp for free. Every day millions of people start a WhatsApp chat with a business because it’s easier to do so than placing a phone call or exchanging emails. We charge businesses to provide customer service on WhatsApp - not people. Some shopping features involve Facebook so that businesses can manage their inventory across apps. We display more information directly in WhatsApp so people can choose if they want to engage with businesses, or not.During this time, we understand some people may check out other apps to see what they have to offer. We’ve seen some of our competitors try to get away with claiming they can’t see people’s messages - if an app doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption by default that means they can read your messages. Other apps say they’re better because they know even less information than WhatsApp. We believe people are looking for apps to be both reliable and safe, even if that requires WhatsApp having some limited data. We strive to be thoughtful on the decisions we make and we’ll continue to develop new ways of meeting these responsibilities with less information, not more.We deeply appreciate everyone who has helped us address concerns and remain available to answer any questions.

There's been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts.WhatsApp was built on a simple idea: what you share with your friends and family stays between you. This means we will always protect your personal conversations with end-to-end encryption, so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see these private messages. It’s why we don’t keep logs of who everyone’s messaging or calling. We also can’t see your shared location and we don’t share your contacts with Facebook.With these updates, none of that is changing. Instead, the update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services. This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms.

People can safely send money to a family member or share the cost of goods from a distance without having to exchange cash in person or going to a local bank.WhatsApp designed our payments feature in partnership with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) using the Unified Payment Interface (UPI), an India-first, real-time payment system that enables transactions with over 160 supported banks. We’re excited to join India’s campaign to increase the ease and use of digital payments, which is helping expand financial inclusion in India.To send money on WhatsApp in India, it’s necessary to have a bank account and debit card in India. WhatsApp sends instructions to banks, also known as payment service providers, that initiate the transfer of money via UPI between sender and receiver bank accounts. We’re delighted to be working with five leading banks in India: ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, the State Bank of India, and Jio Payments Bank. People can send money on WhatsApp to anyone using a UPI supported app.In the long run, we believe the combination of WhatsApp and UPI’s unique architecture can help local organizations address some of the key challenges of our time, including increasing rural participation in the digital economy and delivering financial services to those who have never had access before.Just like every feature in WhatsApp, payments is designed with a strong set of security and privacy principles, including entering a personal UPI PIN for each payment.

While it’s great to hold onto memories from friends and family, most of what we send doesn’t need to be everlasting. Our goal is make conversations on WhatsApp feel as close to in-person as possible, which means they shouldn't have to stick around forever. That’s why we’re excited to introduce the option to use disappearing messages on WhatsApp.When disappearing messages is turned on, new messages sent to a chat will disappear after 7 days, helping the conversation feel lighter and more private. In a one-to-one chat, either person can turn disappearing messages on or off. In groups, admins will have the control.We’re starting with 7 days because we think it offers peace of mind that conversations aren’t permanent, while remaining practical so you don’t forget what you were chatting about. The shopping list or store address you received a few days ago will be there while you need it, and then disappear after you don’t.

While businesses spend billions of dollars annually managing phone calls, e-mails, and SMS, people do not want to wait on hold, get passed from person to person, or wonder if their messages were received.The global pandemic has made clear that businesses need fast and efficient ways to service their customers and make sales. WhatsApp has become a simple and convenient resource in this time. More than 175 million people every day message a WhatsApp Business account. Our research shows people prefer to message a business to get help and they’re more likely to make a purchase when they can do so.Though there is much more we need to build. For the last two years, we’ve provided the WhatsApp Business app and WhatsApp Business API to help businesses of all sizes manage their chats. We’ve listened to feedback on what’s worked and believe WhatsApp can help make messaging the best way for consumers and businesses to connect. To that end we are increasing our investment in the following areas:Shopping - We will expand ways for people to check out available products and make purchases right from a chat. We also want to make it easier for businesses to integrate these features into their existing commerce and customer solutions. This will help many small businesses who have been most impacted in this time.Facebook Hosting Services - Businesses have varying technology needs and want choice in the companies they work with to host and manage customer communications, particularly with remote work increasing. Which is why over the coming months, we plan to expand our partnerships with business solution providers we've worked with over the last two years. We will also provide a new option for businesses to manage their WhatsApp messages via hosting services that Facebook plans to offer. Providing this option will make it easier for small and medium size businesses to get started, sell products, keep their inventory up to date, and quickly respond to messages they receive - wherever their employees are.Business Sales - We will charge business customers for some of the services we offer, which will help WhatsApp continue building a business of our own while we provide and expand free end-to-end encrypted text, video and voice calling for more than two billion people.We know that most people will continue to use WhatsApp simply to communicate with friends and family, which is why we will keep developing great new features and protect people’s private conversations.We believe these additional experiences on WhatsApp meet a real need for many people and businesses whether they are around the corner or across the world. We’re excited about what lies ahead and we'll gradually roll out these services in the months to come."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/search-the-web","date":"2020-08-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Search the Web","text":"WhatsApp provides a special forwarded label to messages shared in chats that have been forwarded many times.

To help them and the thousands of larger businesses on the WhatsApp Business API get discovered, we’re introducing new features to start a chat with a business on WhatsApp and see what goods and services they offer.Starting a chat with a business using QR codesQR codes are a digital front door that make opening a chat with a business as easy as possible. Previously when people came across an interesting business, they had to add its WhatsApp number to their contacts, one number at a time. Now, people simply can scan the QR code a business displays on its storefront, product packaging or receipt to initiate a chat.For example, Ki Mindful Wearing, an activewear brand in Brazil that helped us test the feature, is placing QR codes on packages and product tags to invite customers to reach out for support on WhatsApp.Scanning a QR code will open a chat with an optional pre-populated message created by the business to start the conversation. With the app’s messaging tools, businesses can quickly send back information such as their catalog to get the conversation going. To start using a QR code, businesses can follow these quick steps.QR codes are available for businesses around the world using the WhatsApp Business app or WhatsApp Business API starting today.Catalog sharing to discover what a business offersCatalogs allow businesses to showcase and share the goods or services they offer, which can help them close sales. Since launching last year, catalogs have become a popular way for people to engage with a business on WhatsApp. In fact, more than 40 million people view a business catalog on WhatsApp each month.To make it easier for people to discover products, we’re making catalogs and individual items available to be shared as links on websites, Facebook, Instagram and elsewhere. And if people want to share a catalog or item they find with friends or family, they can simply copy the link and send it on WhatsApp or other places as well.Catalog links are available globally and businesses can learn how to share them here.While the road ahead for businesses will be a long and challenging one as they adjust to a new reality, we look forward to supporting them."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-animated-stickers-qr-codes-and-more","date":"2020-06-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Introducing Animated Stickers, QR codes and more","text":"WhatsApp is already used and loved by more than 2 billion people around the world.

Since we launched the WhatsApp Business app people have told us that it's quicker and easier to chat with a business than making a call or sending an e-mail. Today we are expanding our support for businesses that need more powerful tools to communicate with their customers.Here's how people can connect with a business:Request helpful information: When you need a shipping confirmation or boarding pass, you can give your mobile number to a business on their website, on their app, or in their store to send you information on WhatsApp.Start a conversation: You may see a click-to-chat button on a website or Facebook ad to quickly message a business.Get support: Some businesses may provide real-time support on WhatsApp to answer questions about their products or help you resolve an issue.With this approach, you will continue to have full control over the messages you receive. Businesses will pay to send certain messages so they are selective and your chats don't get cluttered. In addition, messages will remain end-to-end encrypted and you can block any business with the tap of a button.We will bring more businesses onto WhatsApp over a period of time. To do so, we will work directly with a few hundred businesses and a select number of companies that specialize in managing customer communications.If you are interested in how a business can start using these new tools, you can learn more here.

Messaging Statistics: Review simple metrics like the number of messages read to see what's working.WhatsApp Web: Send and receive messages with WhatsApp Business on your desktop.Account Type: People will know that they're talking to a business because you will be listed as a Business Account.

And people will continue to have full control over the messages they receive, with the ability to block any number, including businesses, as well as report spam.Over 80% of small businesses in India and Brazil say WhatsApp helps them both communicate with customers and grow their business today (Source: Morning Consult study).

But the way this happens now on WhatsApp is pretty rudimentary. We've heard stories of shopkeepers who use WhatsApp to stay in touch with hundreds of customers from a single smartphone, and from people who are unsure about whether or not a business on WhatsApp is authentic. In the coming months, we'll be testing new features that aim to solve some of these challenges, and make it easier for people to communicate with the businesses they want to reach on WhatsApp. Our approach is simple – we want to apply what we've learned helping people connect with each other to helping people connect with businesses that are important to them.We know businesses have many different needs. For example, they want an official presence – a verified profile so people can identify a business from another person – and an easier way to respond to messages. We're building and testing new tools via a free WhatsApp Business app for small companies and an enterprise solution for bigger companies operating at a large scale with a global base of customers, like airlines, e-commerce sites, and banks. These businesses will be able to use our solutions to provide customers with useful notifications like flight times, delivery confirmations, and other updates.Whether someone is communicating with a business around the corner or around the globe, people expect WhatsApp to be fast, reliable, and secure.

When you and the people you message are using the latest version of WhatsApp, your messages are encrypted by default, which means you're the only people who can read them. Even as we coordinate more with Facebook in the months ahead, your encrypted messages stay private and no one else can read them. Not WhatsApp, not Facebook, nor anyone else.

For example, you might see an ad from a company you already work with, rather than one from someone you've never heard of.

It has been an amazing journey and in the coming months we're putting an even greater emphasis on security features and more ways to stay in touch with the people that you care about.But anniversary dates are also an opportunity to look back. When we started WhatsApp in 2009, people's use of mobile devices looked very different from today. The Apple App Store was only a few months old. About 70 percent of smartphones sold at the time had operating systems offered by BlackBerry and Nokia. Mobile operating systems offered by Google, Apple and Microsoft – which account for 99.5 percent of sales today – were on less than 25 percent of mobile devices sold at the time.As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use. So, by the end of 2016, we will be ending support for WhatsApp Messenger on the following mobile platforms:BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10Nokia S40Nokia Symbian S60Android 2.1 and Android 2.2Windows Phone 7iPhone 3GS/iOS 6While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don't offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future.This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp. If you use one of these affected mobile devices, we recommend upgrading to a newer Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone before the end of 2016 to continue using WhatsApp.UPDATE: You won't be able to use WhatsApp on the following platforms for:Nokia Symbian S60 after June 30, 2017BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10 after December 31, 2017Nokia S40 after December 31, 2018All Windows Phone operating systems after December 31, 2019, and the app might not be available in the Microsoft Store after July 1, 2019Android versions 2.3.7 and older after February 1, 2020iPhone iOS 7 and older after February 1, 2020Note: Because we will no longer actively develop for these platforms, some features may stop functioning at any time.Last Updated: June 14, 2019"},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/one-billion","date":"2016-01-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"One billion","text":"As of today, one billion people are using WhatsApp. That's nearly one in seven people on Earth who use WhatsApp each month to stay in touch with their loved ones, their friends and their family.We are proud of this milestone, and we're humbled by the extraordinary ways all of you have used WhatsApp. Whether it's sharing vital information during natural disasters or health emergencies, finding a date, growing a small business, buying an engagement ring, or seeking a better life – we're honored to be a small part of what people are doing to make their lives and the lives of those around them better. And yet, through all the progress we've made together over the last seven years, our mission has never changed. WhatsApp began as a simple idea: ensuring that anyone could stay in touch with family and friends anywhere on the planet, without costs or gimmicks standing in the way.So even as we celebrate this achievement, our focus remains the same. Every day, our team continues to work to improve WhatsApp's speed, reliability, security and simplicity. We're excited to see how far we've come. But now, it's back to work – because we still have another 6 billion people to get on WhatsApp, and a long way left to go."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/making-whats-app-free-and-more-useful","date":"2016-01-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Making WhatsApp free and more useful","text":"Nearly a billion people around the world today rely on WhatsApp to stay in touch with their friends and family. From a new dad in Indonesia sharing photos with his family, to a student in Spain checking in with her friends back home, to a doctor in Brazil keeping in touch with her patients, people rely on WhatsApp to be fast, simple and reliable.That's why we're happy to announce that WhatsApp will no longer charge subscription fees. For many years, we've asked some people to pay a fee for using WhatsApp after their first year. As we've grown, we've found that this approach hasn't worked well. Many WhatsApp users don't have a debit or credit card number and they worried they'd lose access to their friends and family after their first year. So over the next several weeks, we'll remove fees from the different versions of our app and WhatsApp will no longer charge you for our service. Naturally, people might wonder how we plan to keep WhatsApp running without subscription fees and if today's announcement means we're introducing third-party ads. The answer is no. Starting this year, we will test tools that allow you to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that you want to hear from. That could mean communicating with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent, or with an airline about a delayed flight. We all get these messages elsewhere today – through text messages and phone calls – so we want to test new tools to make this easier to do on WhatsApp, while still giving you an experience without third-party ads and spam.We hope you enjoy what's coming to WhatsApp, and we look forward to your feedback."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/whats-app-web","date":"2015-01-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"WhatsApp Web","text":"Today, for the first time, millions of you will have the ability to use WhatsApp on your web browser.

As a company, we’re excited to continue focusing on offering as many people as possible the chance to stay connected with friends and loved ones, no matter who they are or where they live. Unfortunately, there has also been a lot of inaccurate and careless information circulating about what our future partnership would mean for WhatsApp users’ data and privacy. I’d like to set the record straight.Above all else, I want to make sure you understand how deeply I value the principle of private communication. For me, this is very personal. I was born in Ukraine, and grew up in the USSR during the 1980s. One of my strongest memories from that time is a phrase I’d frequently hear when my mother was talking on the phone: “This is not a phone conversation; I’ll tell you in person.” The fact that we couldn’t speak freely without the fear that our communications would be monitored by KGB is in part why we moved to the United States when I was a teenager. Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA, and we built WhatsApp around the goal of knowing as little about you as possible: You don't have to give us your name and we don't ask for your email address. We don’t know your birthday. We don’t know your home address. We don’t know where you work. We don’t know your likes, what you search for on the internet or collect your GPS location. None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that.If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change. Everything that has made WhatsApp the leader in personal messaging will still be in place. Speculation to the contrary isn’t just baseless and unfounded, it’s irresponsible. It has the effect of scaring people into thinking we’re suddenly collecting all kinds of new data. That’s just not true, and it’s important to us that you know that. Make no mistake: our future partnership with Facebook will not compromise the vision that brought us to this point. Our focus remains on delivering the promise of WhatsApp far and wide, so that people around the world have the freedom to speak their mind without fear."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/facebook","date":"2014-02-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Facebook","text":"Almost five years ago we started WhatsApp with a simple mission: building a cool product used globally by everybody. Nothing else mattered to us.Today we are announcing a partnership with Facebook that will allow us to continue on that simple mission. Doing this will give WhatsApp the flexibility to grow and expand, while giving me, Brian, and the rest of our team more time to focus on building a communications service that’s as fast, affordable and personal as possible.Here’s what will change for you, our users: nothing. WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently. You can continue to enjoy the service for a nominal fee. You can continue to use WhatsApp no matter where in the world you are, or what smartphone you’re using. And you can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication. There would have been no partnership between our two companies if we had to compromise on the core principles that will always define our company, our vision and our product.On a personal note, Brian and I couldn’t be more proud to be part of a small team of people who, in just under five years, built a communication service that now supports over 450 million monthly active users worldwide and over 320 million daily active users. They have helped re-define and revolutionize communication for the 21st century, and we couldn’t be more grateful. Our team has always believed that neither cost and distance should ever prevent people from connecting with their friends and loved ones, and won’t rest until everyone, everywhere is empowered with that opportunity.

We bet that if our team of engineers could make messaging fast, simple, and personal, we could charge people directly for the service without having to rely on annoying banner ads, game promotions, or all those other distracting “features” that come with many messaging apps. Today, we’re proud to announce that because of you, WhatsApp has reached a milestone that no other mobile messaging service has achieved: 400 million monthly active users, with 100 million active users added in the last four months alone. This isn’t a count of people who just registered for WhatsApp - it’s the number of people who are actively using the service every single month. When we say that you made this possible, we mean it. WhatsApp has just 50 employees, and most of us are engineers. We’ve arrived at this point without spending a dollar on targeted ads or big marketing campaigns. We’re here because of all the people who share their WhatsApp stories with co-workers, friends, and loved ones - stories we love to hear. There was the woman from New Zealand who moved to South Africa to complete her PhD. The week before she left to go back home, she met the man of her dreams. Despite living thousands of miles apart, she told us that WhatsApp has allowed them to feel closer than ever.We also heard from a British woman who runs a charity in Uganda. She told us that her team on the ground uses WhatsApp to send daily reports, photos, and videos of the children they’re helping, which she shares to build support for her organization all over the world.Doctors in India are using WhatsApp to instantly send electrocardiogram pictures of patients who’ve suffered heart attacks, saving valuable time and potentially lives. In the mountains of Madrid, rescuers used WhatsApp to locate and save lost hikers. And today, as I follow the unfolding political crisis in Ukraine, the place where I was born and lived until the age of sixteen, I can’t help but hope that the next great WhatsApp story will be about people using the service to speak their mind and stand up for their basic rights.Our goal in creating WhatsApp was to empower people through technology and communication, no matter who they are, or where they live. We wanted to improve people’s lives in some small way. So thank you for making that possible.

And yes, working hard to sell ads, because that's what Yahoo! did. It gathered data and it served pages and it sold ads.We watched Yahoo! get eclipsed in size and reach by Google... a more efficient and more profitable ad seller. They knew what you were searching for, so they could gather your data more efficiently and sell better ads.These days companies know literally everything about you, your friends, your interests, and they use it all to sell ads.When we sat down to start our own thing together three years ago we wanted to make something that wasn't just another ad clearinghouse. We wanted to spend our time building a service people wanted to use because it worked and saved them money and made their lives better in a small way. We knew that we could charge people directly if we could do all those things. We knew we could do what most people aim to do every day: avoid ads.No one wakes up excited to see more advertising, no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they'll see tomorrow. We know people go to sleep excited about who they chatted with that day (and disappointed about who they didn't). We want WhatsApp to be the product that keeps you awake... and that you reach for in the morning. No one jumps up from a nap and runs to see an advertisement.Advertising isn't just the disruption of aesthetics, the insults to your intelligence and the interruption of your train of thought. At every company that sells ads, a significant portion of their engineering team spends their day tuning data mining, writing better code to collect all your personal data, upgrading the servers that hold all the data and making sure it's all being logged and collated and sliced and packaged and shipped out... And at the end of the day the result of it all is a slightly different advertising banner in your browser or on your mobile screen.Remember, when advertising is involved you the user are the product.At WhatsApp, our engineers spend all their time fixing bugs, adding new features and ironing out all the little intricacies in our task of bringing rich, affordable, reliable messaging to every phone in the world.

Alternatively, if you wait a few seconds, you will be presented with a list of places nearby. Once you select the place to send, it will appear in the conversation. You can tap on the name of the place to get more information about it or you can tap on the map thumbnail to view the place on the map.

At the bottom of this document it said:Above all else, join us in trying to surprise and delight users. Show them their world in innovative ways, and let them interact with it like never before. In our experience, users really respond to polish, both in functionality and user interface. Go the extra mile. Give them more than they expect. And take them places where they have never been before. We are ready to help.Well, our 2.5.12 version does just that: it goes that extra mile. You will not find any new earth-shattering features in this release but we went over every single existing feature in the application and tried to improve it even more. So here is what is coming in 2.5.12 after Apple approves it:Message history search: every wanted to search your conversation history by keywords? now you can.Copy image from clipboard: you can now paste images into the text input box.Scroll bounce inside of the text input box now works. This is a very minor detail but it was important for us to get it right and this also fixes autocorrection suggestions for Asian languages.Video editing: when you try to send a video to your contact which is too long, the application will now ask you to edit and trim the video instead of just blindly tell you video can't be sent.Video thumbnails: no more will you see the generic blue video thumbnail when sending or receiving videos. We will now generate a thumbnail from the video instead of showing you the default blue thumbnail.Application now dismisses Camera when moved into the background. This is a minor detail but that is expected and correct behavior.You can now Delete or Forward individual messages without having to go into the full conversation Edit mode. Simply tap and hold on the message bubble to get the Copy/Delete/Forward menu popup.Have you ever gotten a video or audio attachment in your Email that you wanted to forward directly to a WhatsApp contact? Now you can: simply tap and hold on the attached file in the Email app.Got an iPhone 4? We now generate high resolution thumbnails for pictures that you send to your friends.This will probably affect only a very small percentage of you, but application now behaves correctly when you are running low on storage space on your iPhone and try to use Camera for video or picture.Full localization updates for languages we support.We fixed our contact index bar: it should now work properly with all alphabets.Our audio notes recorder got two updates: retina display graphics and localization.You can now cancel multimedia during upload or download by pressing on the (X) button in the transparent progress indicator bar.We spent A LOT of time trying to improve our networking code. You should see drastic improvements in that area (especially if you use Wi-Fi)We added Dutch localization to this release.You can now preview pictures before sending them. No more sending the wrong picture by mistake.We made rotation from Landscape to Portrait (and from Portrait to Landscape) work much faster.We worked hard on the 2.5.12 version to bring you our most polished release to date. We hope you will enjoy it."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/breaking-the-radio-silence","date":"2010-09-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Breaking the radio silence","text":"It is hard to comprehend that 1992 was almost 20 years ago. It only seems like yesterday that Al Pacino delivered the performance of his life in Scent of a Woman - a performance that won him a best actor award. In that movie Lt. Col. Frank Slade says that \"there isn't nothin' like the sight of an amputated spirit\", but there is also nothin' like the sight of an abandoned blog. We are sorry we haven't kept in touch with you through this blog, but if there was ever a time to break the Radio Silence, now is the time.The first item we would like to address is the stability of our system: Yes, we are well aware that last week has been pretty bad and we are doing everything we can to improve the stability of the service. We have made some architectural changes already and in the next 48 hours will be making more improvements to the system. WhatsApp very quickly has evolved into a large user community and we are fully aware of our commitment to provide you with excellent service.The second item we want to talk about is product related. Two months ago we released our Nokia Symbian client and it is now available for download from our website. We are working on adding multi-media transfer functionality to the Nokia Symbian client and hope to have it ready for you soon. We have also released our Android 2.x client for download from our website. Further, if you have Android 2.2 you will enjoy our use of c2dm to help you save on battery life. Our Android client already has most of the features of the iPhone client and we will be making it available in the Android Marketplace shortly. The question we also get asked a lot about is group chat: yes, we are working on it as well and hope to have it available later this year.The last item we would like to quickly address is the cost of the product. A small number of you have asked us why don't we switch to a free model and use advertising. The problem is that ads suck and ads suck even more on the small screen of a mobile device. We want to provide the best user experience and doing advertising will only get in the way of clean UI.OK, we should now go back to working on the servers:)"},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/yes-it-is-coming","date":"2010-04-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Yes, it is coming!","text":"Yes, in just 24 hours we will make our WhatApp messenger for BlackBerry available for direct download from our website.We also just removed our app from the AppWorld and will no longer be distributing WhatsApp Messenger through the AppWorld.

Etisalat, UAE Orange, France Orange, UK PCCW, Hong Kong T-Mobile, USA China Telecom, China Smartone-Vodafone, Hong Kong the good news is that we have identified the problem and are already in the process of submitting version 2.4 which fixes the issue. we will also email Apple Review Team and ask them to expedite the review process since it is affecting many of our users. meanwhile, until 2.4 is available, you can continue to use WhatsApp 2.3 on Wi-Fi."},{"platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/just-wanted-to-say-a-few-things","date":"2009-11-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Just wanted to say a few things...","text":"It has been about two months since our last blog entry. We've been meaning to write something up, but we've been really busy working on all the new features you've been requesting (version 2.3 will be simply amazing btw!)Yet, we never imagined that our next blog post would be about this.Here is the story. Two days ago a developer of a competing application decided that instead of working on his software, he would go into iTunes, create about ten different accounts, and spread lies and misinformation about what our application does.So first of all, let's set the record straight. We have not, we do not and we will not ever sell your personal information to anyone. Period. End of story. Hopefully this clears things up.That being said, we get a lot of emails and tweets thanking us for such a wonderful application and until now, we haven't asked for anything in return. Unfortunately, circumstances have changed. We now need your help and in a way this is our call to action to you, each and every one of you.Problematically, those fictitious reviews and fake accounts have rated each others reviews as \"Helpful\". This pushes the spurious reviews to the top and scares away new and existing users. So instead of spending today working on software development, we pretty much spent all day answering people's emails and concerns on this subject.So, this is where you, our awesome users, can help us:First, launch iTunes by clicking on this link.That link should display all the fictitious reviews. They are easily identified by a very similar writing style and by having been written on the same day. You will see about ten of them from usernames such as 90sMusic, theTechGuy18, KenyeWest, listenhererightnow, googlereader, blitzcrank, etc.We need your help discrediting these reviews. You can do this by clicking on the \"No\" link in the \"Was this review helpful? Yes/No\" section at the bottom right-hand corner of each review:If enough people choose \"No\", the helpfulness ratio will go down and the reviews will automatically demote to the bottom and out of sight.In exchange for your help, we promise to our users that we will only spend our time on improving our software and adding features; never on stunts like this. We are engineers. We like to write code. And, we want to bring you the best applications possible. It is simply not fun when lawyers get involved and take our time away from that.Thank you for your help and support,-- WhatsApp Inc. team...and to the developer of the competing app, who shall remain nameless, we have four words for you: \"karma is a bitch\".

It is actually good, unlike a lot of negative approval stories floating on the InternetsWhile waiting for approval, we got a call from Apple asking us (very politely) to remove all references to BlackBerry App Store in our application description. That made total sense to us and we removed them right away. A few days later we were in contact with Apple and they asked us to remove certain keywords from iTunes Connect and again. They explained why and their request was absolutely reasonable. And a few days later after that we were in contact with Apple again because they wanted us to change our chat UI. Our apple contact was very polite and explained exactly what we should change and why. He also said that we can optionally decide not to change the UI, but it would just take another week or two to get the application approved. Since we wanted to push the release out ASAP, we changed the UI, re-submitted and got approved the next day.Throughout this interaction with Apple, they have shown to be extremely helpful and absolutely reasonable in their requests.
