Today we're announcing YouTube's first-ever podcast. At YouTube, we’ve enabled our creators to tell their stories through videos that cover pretty much every topic under the sun, from turning your sewing passion into a million dollar business to showcasing life on the family farm to becoming the oldest rookie in NFL history. That’s why today’s announcement is a bit of a curveball—we’re announcing YouTube’s first-ever podcast, called The Upload: The Rise of the Creator Economy. We wanted to showcase the magic of the creator economy in an entirely new way, by taking people behind the scenes to learn what goes into the businesses of the creators whose videos they watch every day. And there was no better partner for us to turn to than National Public Media. The production team at NPM has decades of experience in audio formats, and our collaboration brings the best of audio to provide a unique look at video. To create our first podcast, we collaborated with National Public Media and this is the first custom podcast series from NPM Creative. The show is hosted by Brittany Luse, an award-winning journalist, cultural critic, and co-host of the For Colored Nerds podcast. She formerly co-hosted and executive produced The Nod with Brittany and Eric, a daily streaming show. Brittany and her work have been profiled by The New Yorker, The Guardian, NPR, Essence Magazine, and Teen Vogue, among others. Throughout the series, Brittany will introduce listeners to creators with channels of all sizes who are building dynamic and thriving businesses.
