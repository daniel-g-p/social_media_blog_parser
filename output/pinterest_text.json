Under the theme “Inspiring a Better Future”, the report highlights key initiatives and milestones over the last two years that demonstrate how Pinterest is working to be a positive force for good across our business and within communities. In the report, we summarize our efforts around four main areas: People – We explore how we build a diverse, inclusive, and flexible work culture and support local communities. Product – We share how we prioritize our users and their emotional wellbeing so they can build happier lives, healthier futures and do what they love. Planet – We highlight our efforts to limit our carbon footprint, protect our natural resources and combat climate misinformation. Governance – We detail how our governance sets the foundation for fostering a culture of ethical conduct and accountability across our business and operations. “We’re proud of the milestones highlighted in our inaugural ESG impact report. We also know that making progress in support of these important pillars is an ongoing journey—and we have more to do. We intend to continue with urgency, optimism, and a focus on impact at every step.\" - Bill Ready, CEO at Pinterest Creating careers and lives we love and caring for communities Our employees make Pinterest the success that it is. We are committed to meeting their real-world needs and championing emotional wellbeing so they can bring their best selves to work. In 2022, we introduced PinFlex, a uniquely Pinterest work model that gives our employees the freedom to work from home, at an office, or at a virtual location within their country of employment, and even up to three months working outside their country of employment for eligible employees. We also updated our global parental benefits, expanded access to free mental health and wellbeing resources, peer-to-peer support, and introduced an Ombuds program created to advocate for a healthy, equitable workplace. At Pinterest, we are committed to creating a workplace where everyone feels a sense of belonging and sees themselves represented. To help achieve this, we have 2025 representation targets, including to increase representation of women in leadership by 20%—a goal we met in H1 2022 ahead of the original 2025 timeline. With regard to our community work, we have pledged $10 million to advance emotional wellbeing by supporting Purpose Partners—nonprofit organizations that raise awareness, and provide access to mental health resources. Through our philanthropic efforts and partnerships, we now support the work of 40 Purpose Partners advancing emotional wellbeing in over 30 countries including BEAM (Black Emotional and Mental Health Collective) and Purpose Project. Building a positive corner of the internet We are intentional in our efforts to create a positive, welcoming and—above all—inspiring corner of the internet. Pinterest’s comprehensive community and advertising guidelines are constantly re-evaluated and updated to address the latest trends and developments online. Our ESG Impact Report highlights two recent examples of our longstanding commitment to combating false, negative, and harmful information online. The first is a 2021 ban on ads that contain weight-loss language and imagery, which made Pinterest one of the only major platforms to combat body shaming and dangerous weight loss products or claims in this way. The second, is our industry-leading climate misinformation policy, launched in April 2022, which made Pinterest the first major digital platform to clearly define guidelines against false or misleading climate change information across content and ads. Building a positive corner of the internet means ensuring everyone feels welcomed and supported when they come to our platform. We continuously evolve our features for greater diversity and inclusion. For example, in August 2021, Pinterest unveiled a first-of-its-kind hair pattern search for inclusive beauty results which built on previous features to filter search results by skin tone range, helping to increase representation for underrepresented creators. Whether it’s combating misinformation or creating a more inclusive online experience, Pinterest is deliberate about consistently improving our platform through policy decisions and product developments. Taking care of our planet Earth is our home, and Pinterest strives to make an ongoing, positive impact in preserving it and inspiring action. Our ESG Impact Report shares our approach to track and reduce our emissions. It also details Pinterest’s September 2022 goal to achieve 100% renewable electricity in our global offices in 2023, and our commitment to setting near-term emissions reduction targets in line with climate science and the Science Based Targets initiative—a program designed to drive corporate climate action. Additionally, to help scale cross-industry solutions we serve as members of BSR and Project Drawdown’s Drawdown Labs initiative, while supporting several environmentally focused organizations, like Intersectional Environmentalist and the Potential Energy Coalition. “Pinterest aims to inspire and uplift in all that we do,” said Wanji Walcott, Pinterest Chief Legal Officer. “Our organization and platform are grounded in our values, and our mission of creating a positive, more inspiring world. We are proud to share our ongoing efforts to prioritize emotional wellbeing, and drive a positive impact on society and the environment.” Putting ethics at the heart of our business We are committed to acting with integrity. It is a commitment that is embedded throughout our business and operations and helps us foster a culture of responsible governance, ethical conduct and accountability. It’s not just what we do that matters but how we do it. Good corporate governance drives accountability, transparency and decision-making that strengthens stakeholder confidence. To uphold ethical and responsible standards across our company, we maintain various publicly available company policies, including a Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, which outlines the ethical, lawful conduct we expect from everyone at Pinterest, as well as our Supplier Code of Conduct, which establishes expectations for suppliers working with Pinterest. We are proud to share some of our milestones over the last two years and continue to work on initiatives, commitments and with partners that help us move closer every day to inspire people and build a more positive world. We look forward to continuing to share our ESG journey with you."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/creating-a-better-internet-together","date":"2023-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Creating a Better Internet Together","text":"Today is Safer Internet Day, an annual initiative that aims to raise awareness of emerging online issues and current concerns, from cyberbullying to social networking to digital identity. Over the years, the initiative has become a landmark moment in the online safety calendar that is observed worldwide. Under the theme \"Together for a better internet,\" Pinterest is joining this global call to action to make the internet a safer and better place for all – especially for children and young people. Partnering for Trust, Safety and Emotional Wellbeing Pinterest has partnered with #HalfTheStory, a non-profit and Pinterest Purpose Partner on a mission to empower the next generation's relationship with technology, to create tailored Gen Z content promoting digital wellbeing for teens. Inspired by #HalfTheStory’s digital curriculum, the Pins live in a dedicated board featuring the content and educational information to help provide young people and parents alike the resources they need to forge a positive relationship with technology. “As digital wellbeing pioneers, our mission has always been to empower the next generation’s relationship with technology, and that starts with unpacking the toll it takes on our mental health.” said Larissa May, founder of #HalfTheStory. “We’re proud to partner with a platform like Pinterest that invests in policies to create new standards for the future of responsible technology.” Gen Z Is Seeking a Positive Digital Experience To better understand the need for more positive online experiences, Pinterest commissioned a survey with Morning Consult. According to the findings, 6 in 10 Gen Z respondents (58%) believe people can benefit from a website that is dedicated to positive content and more than half (53%) believe that online platforms and social media have a responsibility to create and craft positive online spaces. Yet, half of respondents (50%) agreed that negative online experiences are becoming more commonplace. The research also found that Gen Z craves a positive association with digital platforms. Through the creation of industry-leading policies, inclusive product features and tools like the Creator Code, we have made it our priority to create a positive, more inclusive and safer place on the internet. In fact, Gen Z users of Pinterest are least likely to report having had a negative experience on the platform (such as cyberbullying, discrimination based on gender or race, or violent content) than on other major platforms. We’re proud to be a platform that encourages self-expression and inspiration – from using Pinterest to find the perfect outfit for a graduation, to becoming a tool for trans teens to express themselves and envision the life they want to live before they come out, there’s a place for everyone on our platform. “Pinterest isn't just about inspiring people to create a life they love. It’s also about inspiring the industry to join us in creating an internet that's as positive, safe, and inclusive as possible,” said Bill Ready, CEO at Pinterest. “I'm proud to support and stand firmly behind Safer Internet Day — today and every day.\" Supporting the Work in Our Communities Youth mental health is a pressing issue and elevating the voices of organizations and young creators who support emotional wellbeing around the world is critical. As a result, we committed more than one third of our total philanthropic funds focused on the advancement of emotional wellbeing to projects specifically dedicated to serving youth. Sustained investment is required to generate true impact, so we renewed some of these partnerships at a two-year commitment. In addition to #HalfTheStory, other partners include The Steve Fund for the creation of a web-based experience for BIPOC young people to explore creative expression in connection to emotional wellbeing and Inseparable for state-level and digital advocacy to improve youth mental health.

Traveling as a Black person has not always felt safe or welcoming in many places, but there are still pockets of seemingly undiscovered Black culture all over the world. For Black History month, Pinterest is launching “Find Your Routes,” a curated Black travel hub with leading creators and publishers to inspire safe travel, help people find places to connect, and shine a spotlight on travel brands and Black owned businesses. “Find Your Routes” is inspired by The Negro Motorist Green Book aka “The Green Book”. The Green Book was a guidebook for Black travelers during the Jim Crow era that provided a list of accessible hotels, boarding houses, taverns, restaurants, service stations and other establishments throughout the country that served Black Americans patrons. “In Pinterest’s Black travel hub, every Save, Board and Pin leads to global connection on our platform and in the real world,” says Malik Ducard, Chief Content Officer at Pinterest. “From seeing the first ever Black dude ranch in Bell Mountain, California, to watching a Black dance troupe in Madrid, our phenomenal creators and publisher partners have curated a colorful range of meaningful travel experiences throughout history.” The Green Book Renaissance on Pinterest People on Pinterest are dreaming about their next trip, not posting about what they already did. Searches for “Black couple travel aesthetic” and “Black girl travel aesthetic” are up 130% and 82% year over year, respectively. For Black History Month, Pinterest can inspire travelers’ futures early in the planning journey, while paying homage to their past. Pinterest’s curated Black travel hub aims to help travelers discover, plan and experience new destinations. Partners participating in Pinterest’s travel hub include: Smithsonian Curator, photographer, and author of The Overground Railroad, Candacy Taylor to curate Pinterest boards to visualize the history of Black travel in the US. Publisher Travel Noire, a digital media company that publishes inspired content for Black travel, will feature hot travel spots, vacation outfits and couple’s vacation aesthetic for the year ahead. A host of creators sharing travel inspiration, including things to do solo in Cartagena Colombia, ultimate 5 day itinerary for Montego Bay, Jamaica, and restaurants to try in Brazil. “Pinterest has the power to utilize my research and photographs to open minds, and reframe our understanding about America,” said Candacy Taylor. “It’s an ideal place to showcase this visual history because it’s an unexpected, yet powerful platform to share this forgotten history to people who may not have read \"Overground Railroad\", or seen the exhibition I curated for the Smithsonian. I think this is an innovative, and exciting opportunity to create something that will reach an even broader audience.” Shopping Black Travel on Pinterest TV Pinterest is elevating Black merchant African skincare brand 54 Thrones with a 60 minute Pinterest TV shopping event in February. Founder Christina Tegbe will showcase the brand’s products and celebrate the rich history of the brand. Bringing Mindful Travel Practices to Pinterest Employees Throughout Black History Month, Pinterest is also offering a company-wide event to help employees gain knowledge about the history, present, and future of Black travel through the lens of Black Pinployees. The company will come together to celebrate the richness and diversity of Black culture—from activism to how to be a more mindful traveler and beyond. They will also have opportunities to donate to nonprofits that support, uplift, educate and empower the Black community."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/condenastxpinterest","date":"2022-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","News","Beauty","Celebrations","Home","Lifestyle","Style","Weddings"],"title":"Pinterest and Condé Nast Entertainment announce an exclusive video content partnership to inspire Pinners globally","text":"Today, Pinterest and Condé Nast Entertainment (CNE) are announcing a global content partnership with two of their most iconic brands, Vogue and Architectural Digest. As part of the deal, Vogue and Architectural Digest will produce over 160 exclusive videos aligned with Pinterest’s key seasonal and cultural moments starting with Fashion Month in February, followed by Wedding Season, Summer, and Back to School. As the home of inspiration, Pinterest has been investing in original content to bring the most inspirational and engaging ideas to the platform - ideas that drive meaningful value and engagement for more than 400 million monthly active Pinners around the world. Condé Nast is already one of Pinterest’s longest-standing and largest content publishers globally – with over 40 Pinterest profiles with tens of millions of views. The partnership is a natural extension of the legacy, rooted in two of Condé Nast’s most beloved brands - Vogue and Architectural Digest. Each of these brands are the leading authorities in their respective spaces of fashion and culture (Vogue), as well as design and architecture (Architectural Digest). New Wedding Destination As Pinterest is a top destination for weddings, Vogue will debut a brand new Pinterest profile in April for all things weddings — from checklists, to table settings, to dream dresses, bridesmaid looks, the boards will cover it all. The new handle will be curated by Vogue Weddings editors and wedding planners, with the biggest weddings of the year getting their own unique boards. “We are delighted to be partnering with Pinterest on this year-long collaboration,” said Ani Shehigian, Senior Vice President of Digital Video English at Condé Nast Entertainment. “With our authority in fashion journalism and international design and architecture through the brands of Vogue and Architectural Digest, we are thrilled to bring even more unique video content with exclusive access, tips, and trends that will continue to inspire.” Fashion Month and Backyard Summer Starting this month, Vogue will bring its unprecedented backstage access and the hottest runway trends to Pinterest in a series of original episodes from Fashion Week in New York, London, Milan and Paris, debuting on its Pinterest profile. This summer, Architectural Digest will explore how to create the perfect backyard space for summer with insights on everything from reviving an outdoor space, to handy hacks for epic outdoor entertaining. The series will begin on Memorial Day and run through Fourth of July. Architectural Digest will also be creating an ongoing slate of content highlighting designs inspired by the 2023 AD100 list – which features the industry’s top designers – as well as episodes on the concept of small living – from the first apartment, to the trend of small house living, to the perfect dorm room. “Condé Nast has a long history of innovating on Pinterest and bringing their editorial voice to life through new content formats and collaborating with Pinterest creators,” said Nadine Zylstra, Global Head of Programming and Originals at Pinterest. “Both Vogue and Architectural Digest have strong audiences on Pinterest who we hope will be as excited as we are about the original content this partnership creates, and the new ideas they inspire.” Over the past two years, Pinterest has been focused on building native content publishing tools for creators to seamlessly publish and curate content as well as expanding its efforts with Pinterest Originals. Last year, Pinterest named Nadine Zylstra, Global Head of Programming and Originals, who spent her career building content strategies at both YouTube and Sesame Workshop. Since then, Pinterest has announced a global partnership with Tastemade to scale creators, content series, and live streaming on Pinterest. Additionally, in partnership with First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Pinterest launched a ten-hour live stream on Pinterest TV for World Teachers Day. World-renowned museum, The Louvre, also partnered with Pinterest in a series of original videos called “A look at the Louvre,” bringing the museum's rich history and architectural design to a new generation of people looking for sparks of inspiration."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-is-now-available-in-afrikaans-croatian-and-bulgarian-languages","date":"2022-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product"],"title":"Pinterest is now available in Afrikaans, Croatian and Bulgarian languages","text":"Today, Pinterest is expanding its language options and is now available for Pinners globally in Afrikaans, Croatian and Bulgarian.

As a digital platform, Pinterest has been hyper-focused on emotional wellbeing and advancing its mission to inspire everyone to create a life they love, while turning their ideas into meaningful action along the way. Pinterest continues to take a stand against toxicity and bias by supporting mental health initiatives, building inclusive product features such as hair pattern search for inclusive beauty results or the skin tone range feature, and implementing impactful policies such as its weight loss ad ban, all with the goal to build a more positive experience for users. Pinterest’s dedication to emotional wellbeing and positivity also extends to employees and work with creators. The company continues to progress on its Inclusion & Diversity goals and collaborates consistently with a diverse network of Pinterest Creators who develop positive and inspiring content for the platform. Last year, the platform revealed its Creator Code, a mandatory set of guidelines intended to educate and build community around making inclusive and compassionate content.

More than a museum, the Louvre is a real place to invest in, a source of inspiration and a driver of creativity. This new series is further proof of Pinterest's ongoing commitment to bringing original and enriching content to the more than 400 million users who turn to the platform each month. \"Our original production strategy aims to partner with the most inspiring creators and partners for our audience, who is always looking for new experiences.

Through this series of original videos \"A Look at the Louvre\", Pinterest and the Louvre offer people off-the-beaten-path tours to discover both collections, the museum's courtyards, staircases as well as unusual places: an invitation to admire details, ceilings, and look at the views from the windows. \"Those who make the detour to the Louvre often remain marked by this place of endless wonder. The museum also impresses from far, inspiring with the quality and grandeur of its works and architecture. Opened in 2012, the Louvre's Pinterest account reaches an average of 230,000 views each month.

To reach a global audience, contents will be available in French and in English and will be posted on Pinterest’s Daily Inspirations page in France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States. While this is the first collaboration with a French museum, Pinterest is developing many partnerships to take the quality of its content to new heights. The partnership with the media Tastemade, established last June on an international scale, is in this vein. The goal is to develop the ecosystem of creators, enrich content production and accelerate live streaming on Pinterest. Many original programs will thus be broadcasted, in the field of cooking, travel, decoration, and much more. Former home of kings, the Louvre has aligned with French history for eight centuries. Conceived from its creation in 1793 as a universal museum, its collections, which are among the finest in the world, span several millennia and a territory that stretches from America to the borders of Asia. As the guardian of this unique heritage, the Louvre is the most visited museum in the world. It is followed by over 10 million people on social networks. Even before the French Revolution, the Louvre was the place where artists could admire great masters and create in their turn. Today, the Louvre continues to feed the imagination of contemporary artists, architects, painters, sculptors, dancers, musicians, and photographers.

This election season, our commitment to combating misinformation is as strong as ever. From prohibiting political ads to removing election-related misinformation, we’re focused on fostering the positive and inspirational ideas that bring people to Pinterest every day. In advance of the U.S. midterm elections this year, we’re taking further steps to strengthen our commitment to not only tackling false and misleading content that could interfere with civic engagement but also sharing reliable information on where and how to vote. Actions we’re taking ahead of the elections include: Search Resource: When Pinners in the U.S. search on Pinterest for topics like voting or elections, we’ll show them a search advisory with the following message: “If you’re looking for information about the 2022 United States midterm elections, including where and how to vote, please visit Vote.org.” Vote.org is a non-partisan resource where you can register to vote, check registration status, get an absentee ballot, and more. Curbing the spread of misinformation: Fighting misinformation is complex and always evolving. It takes an entire ecosystem to support the effort, which is why we work with others in the industry as well as third party experts and organizations, like Graphika, a leader in network analysis. This collaboration supports the integrity of our platform as we hold ourselves accountable to our policies ahead of the elections. We will use our ongoing partnership to focus on topics like election fraud and other related misinformation narratives. Proactive Investigation and Content Review: We have a clear set of Community guidelines to explain what is and isn’t allowed on Pinterest, and a team that enforces them. Our Community guidelines prohibit false or misleading content that impedes an election’s integrity or an individual's or group's civic participation, such as registering to vote, voting, or being counted in a census. We don’t monetize elections-related content: Since 2018, we have not accepted political campaign ads on Pinterest.

That means for the months surrounding the midterms we won’t show any ads when you search for common election-related search terms like candidate names, “vote,” and “election campaigns.”"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-commits-to-100-renewable-electricity-for-its-offices-around-the-world","date":"2022-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Pinterest commits to 100% renewable electricity for its offices around the world","text":"Pinterest is committed to doing our part to promote sustainable outcomes on our platform, within our operations and communities to help create a greener world.

These new markets are added to Brazil and Mexico, where ads have been available since last year. Businesses of all sizes now have access to multiple types of ad formats and targeting options in Argentina, Colombia and Chile, to reach new audiences with meaningful, useful content as they discover ideas and plan new projects. These three markets follow the launch in Japan, earlier this year, and are part of the global expansion of Pinterest’s ad program. On Pinterest, brands are additive to the Pinner experience. People come to Pinterest to discover products and services, for their wardrobe, for their new home, for their next holiday and advertisers want to be discovered. There is incredible harmony between them both. With Pinterest, you can inspire the decisions of consumers because commercial content enhances the Pinterest user’s experience. People come to Pinterest looking for products and services to plan their futures and build their lives. Because 97% of the top searches on Pinterest are unbranded and consist of 2-3 word queries, the majority of consumers are not typing a brand name into their searches, which is why Pinterest is such an effective place to reach people while they’re still considering their next purchase and haven’t decided on a brand. Pinterest is one of the rare platforms where it is truly possible for brands to engage with new customers who are intentional, open and making buying decisions. “Pinterest stands out as a positive environment where consumers come to find inspiration for what to do or buy next. We give businesses of all sizes an opportunity to connect with consumers early in their decision-making journey and we’re proud to expand our global advertising program to three new countries in our region, Argentina, Colombia and Chile. Our advertisers play an incredible role in enabling Pinterest users to turn inspiration into action so they can create a life they love, and we’re excited to enable even more Latin American businesses to now connect with our engaged audience through ads.” - André Loureiro, Managing Director for Latin America at Pinterest. We recently opened ads to a small group of businesses as early partners in Argentina, Colombia and Chile. Brands such as Tiendas Paris (part of Cencosud group) and agencies such as Publicis Groupe have already created campaigns on Pinterest. \"In Paris we are always looking for ways to innovate when showing our fashion campaigns. When we found out that the Pinterest ad platform was going to arrive in Chile, we immediately wanted to do a campaign in the country about \"Color\".

Belén Guini, Fashion Marketing Assistant Manager at Paris. “The team at Pinterest has been extremely helpful from the start until after the campaign was done. They offered mid-campaign optimizations which helped us overdeliver KPIs, leaving us and the client very pleased with our campaign results.

Over 400 million Pinners come to the platform every month to discover new products and shop for brands that inspire them. With the new merchant features, including The Pinterest API for Shopping, Product Tagging for Pins, Video in Catalog, and Shop Tab on Business Profiles, Pinterest is making it easier for merchants to create engaging shopping experiences for the millions of Pinners on the platform. “At Pinterest, our goal is to turn inspiration into action, and our vision for shopping is to make it possible to buy anything Pinners are inspired by on the platform. In 2021, the number of Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces on Pinterest grew over 215%, and 89% of weekly Pinners use Pinterest for inspiration in their path to purchase. The new shopping features such as the API for Shopping allows brands and retailers to reach high-intent Pinners during the earliest stage of their shopping journey with the most updated catalog data.” - Jeremy King, SVP of Engineering at Pinterest The number of merchant catalogs on Pinterest increased by 87% in Q1 2022 compared to the year prior. The Pinterest API for Shopping The vision for The Pinterest API for Shopping is inspiring commerce. Pinterest is extending its investments in shopping and measurement features, including catalog and product metadata management, to enable more efficient improved data quality for merchant products. The Pinterest API for Shopping has been shown to lead to a 97% accuracy level for price and availability data. “Pinterest's new API has allowed Zazzle to efficiently and effectively promote hand-curated design collections via shopping campaigns. We're seeing some promising early performance and are excited for the potential this has to continue showcasing our talented independent creator community.” - Chris Lentini, Chief Marketing Technology Officer, Zazzle Inc. Product Tagging on Pins Product Tagging on Pins is our shopping feature that allows merchants to make their lifestyle Pins shoppable and helps Pinners move easily from inspiration to action. With product tagging, merchants can add products from their catalog to their scene images. Pinners can easily shop for the exact items they love from the inspiring imagery they find.

See Press Release Here. Ben sent an email to employees at Pinterest, which we are sharing below: From: Ben Date: Tuesday, June 28, 2022 Title: Help me welcome our new CEO, Bill Ready Dear Team, After more than a decade running Pinterest, I’ve decided to move into a new role, Executive Chairman. While it feels a bit weird typing these words, more than anything, I’m excited because tomorrow our new CEO will be Bill Ready. I want to share how I came to this decision. One of my rituals to start every year is writing a list of ideas and aspirations for Pinterest. Some of those ideas turn into new products. Others result in acquisitions. This year, a top priority was identifying new leaders with skills that complement mine. I held time on my calendar every week to meet executives across a range of industries. Bill stood out. Over months of conversations and dinners, he impressed me with his insights, experience and values. Bill understands deep down that Pinterest is still early in its story. Over time, I decided he would be an outstanding CEO for our next chapter. Our board of directors met him and felt the same way. Most recently, Bill was President of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users at Google. Before that, he was Chief Operating Officer at PayPal, and CEO of both Braintree and Venmo. At his core, Bill is a builder. He has led small startups and global organizations. He deeply understands commerce and payments. And, he shares our passion for creating a positive corner on the internet—a place that enriches your real life instead of distracting you from it. As you can imagine, this was a hard decision. So much of my heart belongs to Pinterest. I guess you could call it a founder’s love. And, when you care about something so much, the natural instinct is to hold it as tight as you can. But often, the most loving thing to do is let it go and watch it flourish in new ways. That’s what is going to happen with Bill at the helm. I’m not leaving. Being executive chairman will let me focus on what I love: meeting Pinners, nurturing new products, and advising on long-term strategy. My new role reminds me a bit of what I did in the early days. When we started Pinterest, it was more art project than business. I knew most Pinners by their first name. We obsessed over every pixel, feature, and word in our product. I posted my cell phone number on our website to show there was a real person who cared about every user. Thank goodness for unlimited minutes! Today Pinterest has grown beyond anything I could have imagined. If our Pinner community were a country, it would be the third largest in the world. From Rotterdam to Louisville, folks have welcomed me into their homes to show how Pinterest inspired their lives. We have incredible new products in development that I can’t wait to ship. And remarkably, our little art project has even grown into a public company with billions of dollars in revenue and customers around the world. Most meaningful to me, we’ve always remembered that behind all the metrics and dashboards, there are still real people who care deeply about every Pinner’s well being. Our most cherished value, Put Pinners First, is embedded in everything we do. Sometimes people ask me: How did this all happen? Well, the answer is because of all of you. Pinterest wasn’t built by me. It was built by us. And, I love being part of this team. You are not only wildly talented, but also kind, creative and humble. Working with all of you continues to be the biggest gift of founding Pinterest. One final thought. For our very first company offsite, I took our 12 person team to the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. We were so excited to need not just one, but TWO vans to get there—a true sign of growth. I wrote down one of Walt Disney’s quotes: “It’s kind of fun to do the impossible.” Working with you, I’ve learned firsthand that it is indeed fun to do the impossible. And with Bill as our CEO, I know that the fun is just getting started. With all of my love and gratitude, Ben PS: Tomorrow, Bill and I will be doing Q&A together. I hope to see you there so we can give him a warm welcome."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-new-ways-for-advertisers-and-creators-to-inspire-with-idea-ads","date":"2022-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Ads","Company","Creators","Pinterest for Business"],"title":"Introducing new ways for advertisers and creators to inspire with Idea ads","text":"People come to Pinterest with a unique mindset — they are ready to try, do and buy —which is why great ads are both expected and welcomed on the platform.

We prohibit all ads with weight loss language and imagery. We take steps to proactively prevent the spread of misinformation, including false or misleading climate change information.

The alignment between Earth Day and National Volunteer Week struck us as a powerful moment- one during which it made sense to explore how Pinterest can, even offline, contribute to the communities in which our staff live and work.

When we say “everyone,” we mean everyone. And when we say “inspiration,” we believe that starts with inclusion. For our global workforce (Pinployees) and users (Pinners) to be inspired, we want them to feel safe, welcomed, valued and respected for their individuality. And to spark creativity, they must be exposed to new ideas, methods and options. That’s why every day at Pinterest, our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) work strives for Pinclusion. A note from Nichole Barnes Marshall, our new Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity: “In reflecting on the work that took place in 2021, it is apparent that our I&D efforts are increasingly embedded throughout the company, and as a result, people on Pinterest are better able to create a life they love. I’m inspired by the progress we’re making in bringing the ultimate goal of I&D to fruition: ensuring employee representation becomes more reflective of the world we live in, actively engaging our Pinterest workforce in inclusive practices and equitable systems, continuing to build a platform that reflects our diverse population of 400+ million monthly global Pinterest users and partnering with organizations dedicated to justice, equity and wellness. In this report, we will share our work and progress in 2021. While we have many updates to share, we recognize that there is still more to be done. Every day we’re taking action on our commitment to do right by our global Pinterest community, people on Pinterest and partners.” – Nichole Barnes Marshall (she/her/hers), Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity at Pinterest."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/combating-climate-misinformation-on-pinterest","date":"2022-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Combating climate misinformation on Pinterest","text":"Ensuring that Pinners find ideas from trusted sources no matter what type of inspiration they are looking to discover on the platform —from how they cook, the way they shop, build their home, and how to live a more sustainable life —is important to Pinterest. That’s why today, Pinterest is rolling out a new climate misinformation policy to keep false and misleading claims around climate change off the platform. Our new policy makes Pinterest the only major digital platform to have clearly defined guidelines against false or misleading climate change information, including conspiracy theories, across content and ads. As part of our Community guidelines on misinformation and disinformation, our climate misinformation policy removes content that may harm the public’s well-being, safety or trust, including: Content that denies the existence or impacts of climate change, the human influence on climate change, or that climate change is backed by scientific consensus. False or misleading content about climate change solutions that contradict well-established scientific consensus. Content that misrepresents scientific data, including by omission or cherry-picking, in order to erode trust in climate science and experts. Harmful false or misleading content about public safety emergencies including natural disasters and extreme weather events. All ads on Pinterest always have to comply with our Community guidelines. Additionally, we’ve updated our Advertising guidelines to explicitly prohibit any ads containing conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation related to climate change. “Pinterest believes in cultivating a space that’s trusted and truthful for those using our platform. This bold move is an expansion of our broader misinformation guidelines, which we first developed in 2017 to address public health misinformation, and have since updated to address new and emerging issues as they come to the forefront. The expanded climate misinformation policy is yet another step in Pinterest’s journey to combat misinformation and create a safe space online,” said Sarah Bromma, Pinterest’s Head of Policy. Searches for a greener life are rising on Pinterest. People are regularly turning to Pinterest to find ideas to incorporate sustainability into their entire lifestyle as searches for \"zero waste tips\" were 6X greater, “recycling clothes ideas” were 4X higher, “recycled home decor” increased by +95% and “zero waste lifestyle” increased by +64% compared to last year.* Tackling issues like climate change or misinformation are complex, and requires the support and collaboration of an entire ecosystem. We have partnered with experts including the Climate Disinformation Coalition and the Conscious Advertising Network to help inform and develop our policy based on common misinformation themes they’re seeing across media platforms. “Climate disinformation on digital platforms is a serious threat to the public support needed to solve the climate crisis. Pinterest has demonstrated great leadership by creating a community standard that includes a definition of climate misinformation, and we will continue to press all platforms for transparency and reporting on their actions. We encourage others to take note of Pinterest’s efforts to reduce climate change disinformation,” said Michael Khoo, Climate Disinformation Co-Chair at Friends of the Earth."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-pinflex-an-inspiring-work-model-for-our-employees","date":"2022-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Introducing PinFlex, an inspiring work model for our employees","text":"Today, we’re announcing PinFlex, a uniquely Pinterest work model that provides employees the autonomy to live and work flexibly, while prioritizing intentional in-person collaboration at our world class offices.

We designed this work model in collaboration with leaders, managers, and employees, to create a highly connected community and an inspiring environment for every Pinployee.” – Christine Deputy, Chief People Officer Instead of assigning the number of days employees need to be in an office, we believe it is essential to let the work guide the collaboration style. Teams will plan to visit a Pinterest office when partaking in collaborative work or celebratory culture building. For more autonomous work, they’ll have the flexibility to live and work where they choose, whether that’s at home, in-office, at a café, or wherever else they feel inspired. Our offices will continue to provide our employees with the tools, resources, and comforts they need to do their best work and they are encouraged to visit as frequently as they would like. All employees will be expected to visit a Pinterest office at least once a year to connect with one another and to engage in culture building activations like Knit Con.

Now, with Idea Pin Sharing and Downloading, a creator’s original Pinterest content can go even further reaching new audiences on and off Pinterest. To benefit from the new feature creators have to allow their Idea Pins to be downloaded and shared across other platforms, including the Pinterest watermark, in their permissions settings.

Once the download finishes, it takes the user to the Facebook or Instagram app with the story creation flow open and the watermarked Idea Pin video pasted in. It can then be edited and posted.

The download option provides the ability to quickly save and upload watermarked Idea Pin content onto other platforms like Snapchat and TikTok.

As has been in place, after leave, birthing and adoptive parents can gradually return to work over the course of four weeks and can work the equivalent of one full day per week for full pay. 12 weeks paid leave for NICU. A new policy allowing parents of newborns in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) to take 12 weeks paid leave as family care leave. 20 weeks and up to $10K for adoptive parents globally. Adoptive parents will have 20 weeks of paid leave (extended from 16 weeks in the U.S.), in addition to an increase of monetary assistance from $5,000 to $10,000. Four weeks paid leave for pregnancy loss. A new policy offering four weeks of paid leave to parents who experience a loss through a miscarriage at any point in the pregnancy. Global IVF & egg freezing. IVF & egg freezing will be available for all (two IVF cycles and egg freezing), extending globally from an existing U.S. benefit. \"This is one of the first companies we've heard of to provide dedicated leave to support NICU families. Keeping parents and NICU babies together during a hospital stay is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for these families. This policy will have a powerful impact on the lives of so many, ensuring they thrive well beyond the NICU. We applaud Pinterest’s leadership and hope other companies will follow suit to help meet the critical needs of NICU babies and their parents.\" —Keira Sorrells, Preemie Mom, Founder & Executive Director NICU Parent Network"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-predicts-the-trends-to-watch-for-2022","date":"2021-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Ads","News","Lifestyle","Trends"],"title":"Pinterest Predicts: The trends to watch for 2022","text":"Pinterest Predicts is back—and in it’s eighth year, it’s bigger than ever with 175+ key trends we predict will rise in 2022.

Our insights aren’t a retrospective, or a round-up of what was trending — it’s a predictive look ahead into what will be trending in 2022 across home, beauty, fashion, food, wellbeing, parenting, travel, design and more. To predict these trends, we analyzed what our 400 million+ monthly users around the world (1) have been searching for (and with an average 80% accuracy (2). We then spotlighted the most inspiring ideas to explore for the year ahead based on these emerging searches. People come to Pinterest to plan what to do, try or buy next.

Beauty & Fashion: People will shake up their beauty look in 2022 with trends like “Puff love,” “Nailscapes” and “Rebel cuts.” And for those interested in shaking things up with their clothing instead, they’ll try out “Pearlcore,” “Dopamine dressing” or “Oh my goth.” Celebration & Food: From adoption parties to breakup cakes, people will take any reason to celebrate in 2022 with our “Altbashes” trend.

Millions of people turn to Pinterest as a positive source of inspiration, and we understand how important it is that content on our platform supports emotional wellbeing and inclusivity. For the first time, we’ve added a new section to the report on community safety and wellbeing, which describes some of the ways we’ve invested in our community through policies, products, and partnerships: We’ve developed and continued to refine features like AR Try on and skin tone ranges that allow users to refine beauty-related searches to find what they’re looking for. We introduced the Creator Code, our content commitment designed to educate and empower content creators to keep Pinterest a positive and inspiring place. In February, we used our platform to generate awareness of National Eating Disorders Awareness Week in partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). We furthered our commitment to combat COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. We continue to iterate and improve our transparency reporting. In this report, we updated our section on Community guidelines enforcement to be organized by policy category instead of action type to provide a more holistic view of our content moderation actions within a policy category. Now there is a section for each policy category that includes data on actions we’ve taken to enforce that policy, like the number of Pins and boards deactivated. It’s important to note that, even with this new format, we’re still reporting all the same information that we included in our last transparency report.

What it means to identify as Latiné looks different for every person. That’s why Pinterest’s theme for Latiné Heritage Month, “Loudly & Proudly ________ Latiné'' aims to challenge the perception of a monolithic Latiné identity by encouraging people to show how they are uniquely, loudly and proudly Latiné. Guided by Pinterest’s internal employee resource group, Todos Pincluidos(opens in a new window), Pinterest is embracing Latiné as a term that is not only inclusive and gender neutral, but also easier to pronounce in Spanish than the more commonly used term, Latinx. “This month is a reminder of the immense diversity within the Latiné and Hispanic communities,” said Luis Aguirre, Vice President of Development for Todos Pincluidos. “I love taking time to celebrate my community, my culture and my identity, but also to learn more about the experiences of others. Every year, I emerge from Latiné Heritage Month feeling energized to continue uplifting and supporting our community.” To celebrate Latiné Heritage Month, Pinterest launched a Shopping Spotlight(opens in a new window) collection featuring 20+ brands that identify as Latiné.

Through computer vision-powered object detection, hair pattern search enables Pinners to refine hair searches by six different hair patterns: protective, coily, curly, wavy, straight and shaved/bald. Over the coming weeks, Pinners can search for a broad hair term like “summer hairstyles”, “glam hair”, or “short hair” and narrow their results by selecting one of the six hair patterns to find hair inspiration that is most relevant to their style and preference. Pinterest has detected a hair pattern (e.g. coily, curly, protective) in over 500 million images on our platform.* This new technology builds on Pinterest’s industry-first inclusive product feature skin tone ranges first launched in 2018. It not only marks a major step forward for inclusivity in tech, but also responds to the millions of Pinners who are looking for an easier way to find the most relevant hair inspiration for them. In the past month alone, there were over 120 million searches for hair and over 5 billion Pins were created related to hair on Pinterest.** We’ve also seen that top hair searches on Pinterest are personalized - for example, “natural hair twists protective\" (15x) and \"best haircuts for thick wavy hair\" (13x).***"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-new-ways-for-creators-to-earn-money-and-partner-with-brands-on-pinterest","date":"2021-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","News","Product"],"title":"Introducing new ways for Creators to earn money and partner with brands on Pinterest","text":"As the platform where people come to get inspired, Pinterest provides Creators the ability to build and grow their audience in a positive environment.

According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), there’s been a steep rise in unhealthy eating habits and eating disorders in young people since the COVID-19 pandemic started last year1,2. Many are now feeling added pressure as they look to rejoin their social circles in person for the first time in 15 months. Pinterest is the place people come for inspiration to create life they love. It’s where everyone belongs—regardless of body shape or size. We're empowering Pinners to plan for a summer and beyond without weight loss ads, so they can focus on what matters most. Beginning July 1st, 2021, we’re updating our ad policies to prohibit all ads with weight loss language and imagery. This stance makes Pinterest the only major platform to prohibit all weight loss ads. It’s an expansion of our ad policies that have long prohibited body shaming and dangerous weight loss products or claims. We encourage others in the industry to do the same and acknowledge, once and for all, that there's no such thing as one-size-fits-all. Our updated policy will now prohibit: Any weight loss language or imagery; Any testimonials regarding weight loss or weight loss products; Any language or imagery that idealizes or denigrates certain body types; Referencing Body Mass Index (BMI) or similar indexes; and Any products that claim weight loss through something worn or applied to the skin This is in addition to ad content that is already barred from Pinterest, including: Weight loss or appetite suppressant pills, supplements, or other products; Before-and-after weight-loss imagery; Weight loss procedures like liposuction or fat burning; Body shaming, such as imagery or language that mocks or discredits certain body types or appearances; and Claims regarding unrealistic cosmetic results Ads promoting healthy lifestyles and habits or fitness services and products will still be allowed, as long as they don’t focus on weight loss. This policy change was developed with the guidance and advice of NEDA. “The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) applauds Pinterest for taking a leadership position as the first platform to prohibit all ads with weight-loss language and imagery. NEDA is encouraged by this necessary step in prioritizing the mental health and well-being of Pinners, especially those impacted by diet culture, body shaming, and eating disorders. We are hopeful this global policy will encourage other organizations and companies to reflect on potentially harmful ad messages and to establish their own working policies that will create meaningful change,\" said Elizabeth Thompson, Interim CEO for the National Eating Disorders Association."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/pinterestshopamex","date":"2021-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Pinterest for Business"],"title":"Pinterest collaborates with American Express on a digital Shop to support small businesses this summer","text":"Today, Pinterest and American Express have teamed up to curate “The Comeback Edit” on The Pinterest Shop - the shop’s sixth edit featuring 20+ merchants that are selling items Pinterest users are looking for as they enter this new stage of post-pandemic life.

Shopping small over summer weekends alone can help inject over $27 billion into the national economy3. “At American Express we understand how vital small businesses are to our communities and are always looking for opportunities to provide consumers with interactive and immersive ways to Shop Small,” says Walter Frye, Vice President of Global Brand Engagement & Design at American Express. “Inspiration plays a critical role in the decision process and we know the Shop Small Summer Pinterest Shop will inspire consumers looking to support small businesses this summer.” The Pinterest Shop was launched in November 2019 with a selection of small businesses to shop from for the holiday season and has since featured more than 150+ small businesses. Over the last three years, the Shop has curated edits for the 50th anniversary of Earth Day - featuring Lauren Conrad’s eco-friendly brand The Little Market, for National Black Business Month featuring Black-owned fashion and beauty brands (featuring supermodel Liya Kebede), a selection of the most searched holiday gift ideas on Pinterest (from 120+ merchants) and last March, a women-owned small businesses edit from around the world for International Women’s Day."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-opens-its-doors-in-mexico-city","date":"2021-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","Technology"],"title":"Pinterest Opens its Doors in Mexico City","text":"Today we’re announcing the opening of our office in Mexico City as part of our investment in scaling global resources and hiring local talent to grow our business to serve Pinners, creators and advertisers around the world. The Mexico City office will include the very first engineering hub in Latin America. We will hire more than 50 people across engineering and sales for the new Mexico City office during the year. This will be our second office in Latin America, after the opening of the office in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2014. We believe the only way we can build a product that people use all over the world is if it has worldly perspectives at the table—both at the technological level and the human level. When tech work is more accessible to people from a range of backgrounds and geographies, we believe we can build consumer products that are more inclusive of everyone. This mindset is driving the expansion of engineering to new geographies such as Mexico City. Mexico City already has a strong talent pool of engineers, particularly in backend and Android skillsets, and with the world class computer science program at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) this pool will continue to increase. The engineering team in Mexico City will comprise all types of engineers including, internal tooling, frontend engineering for iOS, Android, and Web as well as Pinterest’s human evaluation platform to be used for both Trust & Safety, and to label data for machine learning algorithms. “This is a pivotal time for Pinterest as we’ve grown to reach 475M+ Pinners, with an engineering team building new technology that brings inspiration to people around the world. In order to fulfill our mission to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, we must continue to bring talented engineers to the team. We’re thrilled to open opportunities to engineers in Mexico City, with skills uniquely matched to our needs as a visual discovery engine. Our new engineering office in Mexico City will not only help Pinterest access world class engineering and machine learning talent, but will also contribute to the technology community in Mexico.” - Jeremy King, Head of Engineering at Pinterest. Pinterest has a growing, passionate user base across Latin America, including Mexico and there is an opportunity for businesses to connect with this audience when they’re considering what to do or buy. With an office and Mexico City based Sales team, Pinterest will be able to work more closely with businesses in Mexico and the Hispanic Latin America across industries such as retail, home, food, fashion, beauty, and tech. Pinterest is an inspiration network powered by the largest dataset of human-curated ideas, with more than 300 billion ideas saved by more than 475 million people around the world. People come to Pinterest to discover things — for their wardrobe, for their new home, for their next holiday. Pinterest is where the next generation in computer vision and recommendations technology, AR and AI, and visual search and object detection is being developed. Engineers at Pinterest are innovating by using technology as a key driver to make Pinterest a must-go shopping destination that’s more like walking the virtual aisles than anywhere else and a place where people can virtually try on products, comparison shop across brands and price points, and search and shop with their camera and within images.

Now, more than 1.7 million Shopify merchants around the world have an easy way to bring their products to Pinterest and turn them into shoppable Product Pins that are discoverable across the platform. Shopify merchants advertising on Pinterest through Shopify will also have access to Dynamic Retargeting for the first time, which will enable them to re-engage with Pinners who have already expressed interest in their products on Pinterest. Pinterest is also launching Multi-feed support for Catalogs, a new feature allowing businesses to easily upload their products in multiple product feeds within the same Pinterest Business account. Shopify merchants as well as any retailer with a Pinterest business account are now able to add up to 20 product feeds to their account, each indicating specific local data such as a currency, language or product availability. Multi-feed support for Catalogs gives retailers the opportunity to engage more easily with customers all over the world, allowing them to upload a specific feed for each market they sell products in but also to upload feeds to serve different advertising strategies such as prospecting or retargeting. Because 97% of the top searches on Pinterest are unbranded and consist of 2-3 word queries, the majority of consumers are not typing a brand name into their searches. On Pinterest, businesses of any size have an equal chance to be discovered by +450 million consumers who are looking for products and services, open to all types of brands, and are planning their next purchase. This unique mindset of the Pinterest audience provides a valuable advantage to small and medium sized businesses who can gain more visibility because of the relevancy of their content and the quality of their products. Over the past year, consumers have significantly shifted their shopping habits. According to the Shopify “Future of Commerce 2021” study, 84% of global consumer respondents have shopped online since the start of the pandemic. As a result, many merchants have seized the opportunity to set up shop on Pinterest to provide an online shopping experience that recreates the in-store shopping experience such as browsing the store aisles, seeing curated collections from retailers, and price comparisons. On Pinterest, Catalog feed uploads increased globally by over 14x from March 2020 to March 2021 (Source: Pinterest Internal Data). “Pinterest is an inspiring place to shop and we're excited to expand our partnership with Shopify to help merchants in 27 more countries grow their shopping presence on Pinterest globally. Small and medium businesses in particular have the opportunity to thrive on Pinterest because they connect with consumers in a positive environment when they are early in their decision-making journey and full of purchase intent. With the retail ecosystem profoundly evolving over the past year, we’re committed to supporting merchants of all sizes by providing them with a quick and easy access to our shopping features without the need to edit code or deploy resources so they can inspire consumers for what to do or buy next.” - Bill Watkins, Global Head of Mid-Market and Small Business Sales at Pinterest. “Discoverability is top of mind for Shopify merchants—and social commerce has been a driving factor in helping independent businesses build meaningful audiences, particularly throughout this last year when we saw installs of our social commerce channels grow 76%,” said Lola Oyelayo-Pearson, Director of UX, Channels and Financial Services at Shopify. “Expanding the Pinterest channel globally will mean that the more than 1.7 million merchants using Shopify can tap into the purchasing power of over 450 million Pinterest users by building thoughtful, targeted marketing campaigns.” Shopify merchants such as PDPAOLA, Rothys, Jennifer Fisher and Sukoshi Mart have already seen success using the Pinterest app on Shopify."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-the-content-claiming-portal-a-new-tool-to-help-creators-claim-their-content-and","date":"2021-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","News"],"title":"Introducing the Content Claiming Portal, a new tool to help creators claim their content and decide how it appears on Pinterest","text":"Today, Pinterest is introducing its Content Claiming Portal as a brand new tool that enables creators to claim their content and decide if and how it appears on Pinterest.

To get started, content creators can submit a Content Claiming Portal application, and if your application is approved, you’ll be able to upload your original content and select from one of the following enforcement options: Mine only: Remove existing and future versions of the images from Pinterest, except Pins originally saved by me. Website only: Remove existing and future versions of the images from Pinterest, except Pins that link to my claimed website(s). (This option will only be available if you have a claimed website.) Block all: Remove all existing and future versions of these images from Pinterest. Once a rights holder uploads a particular image, they can tell us whether they want to allow that image to appear on Pinterest.

We have been at the forefront of combating health misinformation and ensuring Pinners have access to reliable third-party sources for several years. In fact, we were one of the first platforms to implement a policy prohibiting health misinformation, including vaccine falsehoods, in 2017. As a visual platform reaching more than 450 million monthly active Pinners worldwide, tackling health misinformation continues to be a priority. In February 2020, the team officially introduced our first phase of COVID misinformation efforts, including a custom search experience with results from experts, prohibiting ads that claimed to offer misleading cures or treatments for COVID-19 through our longstanding policies, and featuring expert information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as part of the introduction of our Today Tab, a source of daily inspiration. Providing Pinners with reliable information is critical as COVID-19 vaccines become more available. That’s why we are expanding efforts by furthering our work with authoritative leaders such as health institutions, doctors, and community organizations to highlight expert content around COVID-19 and the vaccines on Pinterest. Through these collective efforts and a large donation of ad credits, Pinterest is aiming to reach all Pinners in the United States. Pinterest is combating COVID-19 vaccine misinformation by: Amplifying medical voices. Pinterest is partnering with the Association for Healthcare Social Media (AHSM), a national organization of healthcare professionals dedicated to engaging with audiences online to provide expert information about important medical topics. This network of professionals will create Story Pins that educate Pinners about COVID-19 vaccines, generate awareness about the importance of vaccination, and dispel myths. Partnering with medical organizations that serve underrepresented groups. With underrepresented individuals in Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19, we are committed to providing resources for organizations who advocate for these audiences. Pinterest is offering paid media, creative resources, and support for medical organizations serving underrepresented communities to amplify and elevate reliable third-party COVID-related resources on Pinterest. Supporting the AdCouncil’s national campaign. To further promote educational content from authoritative sources whenever users search COVID-19 vaccine-related content, Pinterest will be providing paid media to the AdCouncil in support of its national COVID-19 vaccine awareness campaign “It’s Up to You.” Through this partnership, the AdCouncil will encourage audiences on Pinterest to get the latest vaccine information—understanding that personal education is the first step in building vaccine confidence. Showcasing authoritative content on Expert Search and Today Tab. Story Pins created by medical professionals from the AHSM and the AdCouncil Campaign content will be showcased on the Today Tab in the coming months. When people search on Pinterest for topics related to coronavirus, a banner that leads to the WHO COVID-19 resource page appears so Pinners can learn more. Expert Search results also feature relevant content created by doctors and medical organizations like the WHO and the CDC. Pinterest is continuing to remove misinformation about COVID-19 because it violates our health misinformation policy. We recognize that this work is ongoing, and is just one of the ways we’re working to ensure Pinterest is an inspiring place for everyone to discover useful and trustworthy ideas for their lives."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/draft-pinterest-presents","date":"2021-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Ads"],"title":"Pinterest hosted first-ever global advertiser summit “Pinterest Presents”","text":"Today, we hosted Pinterest Presents, our first global advertiser summit with sessions in the US, UK, France, Germany, Canada and Australia, offering attendees an immersion into our global vision to build a positive and inclusive platform.

Around the world, working women were the most affected by changes we saw in 2020 and so we launched the International Women's Day Shop as a way to support and show our commitment to small businesses. Pinterest has always been the place to be inspired and discover new brands. We are thrilled to give these women-run businesses a platform to shine.” - Aya Kanai, Head of Content and Creator Partnerships, Pinterest. In this time of crisis, women are also turning to Pinterest to find inspiration on how to navigate change - searches for “women supporting women'' increased by 2x, searches for “small business plan” increased by 50x and searches for “start a business from home” increased 4x. Boards created by women for “dream jobs” have increased by 10x² as they are looking to find new jobs, start a business or shift careers."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-partners-with-national-eating-disorders-association-to-support-body-positivity","date":"2021-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News"],"title":"Pinterest partners with National Eating Disorders Association to support body positivity","text":"At Pinterest, our priority is to create a positive and inspiring place for Pinners. And feeling inspired and planning your future can be difficult if you are struggling with personal challenges. Pinterest is proud to partner with the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), the largest nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting individuals and families affected by eating disorders, to help raise awareness and build communities of support and recovery for those in need. NEDAwareness Week (#NEDAwareness) Eating disorders are serious but treatable mental and physical illnesses that can affect people of all genders, ages, races, religions, ethnicities, sexual orientations, body shapes, and weights. Pinterest is supporting National Eating Disorders Awareness Week (February 22-28), to help shed light on eating disorders by educating the public, spreading a message of hope, and making important resources readily available for those in need. With this year’s theme, NEDA is inviting “Every Body to Have a Seat at the Table” by welcoming conversations on awareness, challenging systemic biases and sharing stories from all backgrounds and experiences, which is particularly important in a field where marginalized communities continue to be underrepresented. Pinterest will be donating ad credits to encourage people to tune into NEDAwareness Week events and the different roundtables taking place. Story Pins will also be used to generate awareness on the platform, along with a feature educating Pinners about eating disorders communication and recovery on the Today Tab. “Having Pinterest’s support during NEDAwareness Week is crucial to help shed light on this important issue,” said Jennifer Solar, Director of Communications at NEDA. “Pinterest is where so many people go to learn new things and feel inspired. By partnering with Pinterest, we are able to extend our reach and provide tools to those who need them, whether they or a loved one are battling an eating disorder.” Promoting Positivity People are increasingly looking for mental health resources. In 2020, Gen Z Pinners turned to Pinterest for inspiration on ways to stay positive and healthy with searches for “mental health check in” up five-fold and “mindful eating” up 44 percent.¹ Our role is to help people find the resources they need from a professional, and we’re making it easier to reach those experts when they need it. Whenever Pinners search for keywords on the platform related to eating disorders, we direct them to the NEDA website to find additional resources. Additionally, our ad policies have long prohibited body shaming and dangerous weight loss products and claims. Our policies are created to protect Pinners and support Pinterest's mission of inspiration. A positive and more inspired Internet is a better place to be for the world – and that means continuing to work hard and maintain Pinterest as a place for positivity. ¹Trends are calculated by comparing normalized searches in July 2020 to July 2019 amongst Gen Z, ages 18-24; global"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/get-backstage-access-to-fashion-week-on-pinterest","date":"2021-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product","Style"],"title":"Get backstage access to New York Fashion Week on Pinterest","text":"The most awaited month of fashion is about to kick off with New York Fashion Week.

In this newly created role, Ari will oversee Pinterest’s social impact efforts, including a philanthropic strategy focused on expanding emotional well-being and place-based giving across Pinterest’s global footprint. Pinterest believes emotional well-being is a precondition for inspiration and creating a life we love — that to live a life you love, you need to have a self you love. Inspiration means different things to different people. On the platform, some people are looking for recipes to cook for their family. Some people look for things to wear to work and some save quotes as motivation to exercise or feel more joyful. Well-being has profound resonance and it is at the heart of what it means to bring inspiration and positivity to people’s lives. As Pinterest works to build a more positive corner of the internet, the Social Impact and Philanthropy function focuses on taking its impact offline in three areas: Expanded Employee Volunteerism: The company is launching an expanded volunteer service program that will grant employees five volunteer days off to support civic and community engagement activities every calendar year. Donation Match: Pinterest is increasing its donation matching program and will match funds to eligible nonprofits, dollar for dollar, up to $1,000 per employee every year. Whether it’s one big donation, or spread across multiple nonprofits throughout the year, it will support gifts to qualified organizations. Charitable Giving: Pinterest’s expanded philanthropy program will provide 250,000 shares of stock (currently valued at roughly $17 million) in grants this year. The primary focus of the grantmaking will be in the area of emotional well-being, particularly increasing awareness, reducing stigma, supporting innovations in the field, and tackling inequities in access and disparities in outcomes. In addition, the program will include a place-based community giving portfolio, and a reserve for responsive grantmaking to tackle urgent or emerging challenges, like the COVID-19 pandemic and support for organizations tackling racial and other inequities. “Our approach to Social Impact and Philanthropy is guided by the belief that this work doesn’t stand separate from our identity as a company, but is rather core to our brand, our identity, and our long-term vision for impact,” said Ari Simon, Head of Social Impact and Philanthropy. “It’s about finding new and powerful ways to bring inspiration to the world, to reinforce our core values through action, and to show up collectively in the places where we live and work. I’m proud of our progress in my short time at Pinterest and I’m looking forward to building on this vision.” “I’ve always been inspired by the work that employees do outside of Pinterest, donating time to causes and communities they care about,” said Ben Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest. “I’m thrilled to work alongside Ari to focus our efforts on emotional well-being and give employees the tools they need to move quickly whenever they feel inspired to make a difference. With more than 15 years of experience developing and leading programs in the philanthropic sector, Ari approaches this role with passion and a deep understanding of the work ahead.” Before joining Pinterest Ari was Vice President, Chief Program and Strategy Officer at The Kresge Foundation for seven years. He led the foundation’s domestic and global grantmaking and directed its Opportunity Fund focused on protecting civil rights, promoting racial equity, and ensuring the stability of our democratic system of government. Ari joined Kresge after five years with McKinsey & Company, where he focused on social innovation, economic development, and public health. Prior to that, he was a writer and editor of the Shuttle Columbia Accident Report as well as the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee Investigation of the Oil-for-Food Programme, served as a volunteer on ambulances in the Middle East, and worked for the Innocence Project while in law school. Ari earned a bachelor’s degree at Harvard College, a master’s degree at Oxford University, and a law degree at Stanford University."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/pinterest-introduces-following-streams","date":"2020-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","Product","Technology"],"title":"Pinterest introduces an easier way to discover fresh ideas from creators with following streams","text":"More than 442 million people come to Pinterest every month hungry for ideas and ready to take action. They’re looking for inspiration like what to cook for dinner, how to style an outfit or a new beauty product to buy, and Story Pins from creators can help them bring those discoveries to life. As the home of inspiration, Pinterest is a place to discover not only great ideas but also the people behind them. That’s why we’re introducing Story Pins following streams, a place for Pinners to see new Story Pins from the creators they follow, right at the top of the home feed. In this immersive stream, Pinners can find fresh Story Pins and even find new creators to follow through the “Discover creators” icon. Following is the first step in connecting and engaging with creators on Pinterest. For Pinners, following means getting more original ideas from creators and building a more relevant recommendation system in their home feed. For creators, following means building an engaged audience united by the inspiration they provide. Story Pins are different in all the ways Pinterest is different from other apps — the main value is discovering positive, inspirational and educational ideas, and not just for entertainment purposes. They’re saveable, actionable and long-lasting so they can be discovered over time. From the following stream, Pinners can save ideas and visit a creator's profile to see even more ideas that might inspire their next project.

We’re introducing more ways to try on and shop trends from your camera and within the products in Pins. Today we’re launching our latest augmented reality feature — AR Try on for eyeshadow, with products from Lancome, YSL, Urban Decay, and NYX Cosmetics. In addition to eyeshadow Try on, we’re also expanding our product tagging beta, with access opening up to some advertisers today, and to creators to create shoppable Story Pins and tag products, in the coming months. Millions of people come to Pinterest every month to search for beauty ideas and inspiration. This is our latest step in bringing together the worlds of visual search and shopping as people come to Pinterest to shop early in their decision-making process, ready to discover new brands and products. With eyeshadow Try on, powered by Lens, Pinners can use AR technology to try on and shop beauty products right the iOS or Android app. Simply click the Lens camera in search and browse eyeshadows, try on in-stock shades, and purchase through the retailer. Pinners can also filter product results by color and price range and brand, save to a board for later, or view a “more like this” section and see additional Pins with similar shades and filter recommendations by their own skin tone range. The experience will also go live when searching for eyeshadow-related queries in text search. With existing lipstick Try on, toggle between lip and eyeshadow looks by clicking the eye or lip icon at the top. The virtual eyeshadow experience can be found across more than 4,000 shoppable shades. Try on makes it easy to try and buy from the convenience of home. In fact, Pinners are 5x more likely to show purchase intent on Try on-enabled Pins than standard Pins. Expanding product tagging Thanks to updates to computer vision, object detection and catalog uploads, it’s becoming easier to shop from a scene on Pinterest. We’ve found Pinners are 70% more likely to show shopping intent on products tagged in scene images than on standalone Product Pins. In October we announced updates to make product tagging more seamless with a new design and functionality for retailers to tag their own scene images with specific products, and now we’re starting to open the feature in beta to a growing number of advertisers. In the coming months we’ll launch product tagging to creators to tag in-stock products in their own Story Pins. The future of shopping will rely on online shopping experiences that are similar to that of in-store and complement that joy we find in browsing, seeing curated collections, and trying on products until we find what’s best for us.

We are sharing our recommendations to ensure that Pinterest is the inclusive, fair, and respectful workplace that we -- and Pinterest’s employees -- want it to be. Our recommendations are rooted in our extensive review and assessment of the Company’s culture, including the experiences and observations employees shared, and we thank them for participating in this important process. Although this stage of our review is coming to a close, the work is just beginning. The Board of Directors has unanimously adopted our recommendations, and we are fully invested in their implementation. The recommendations from the Special Committee can be viewed here: Recommendations to Enhance Pinterest’s Workplace Culture Note from Co-founder and CEO Ben Silbermann to Pinterest Employees Team, Today, the Special Committee of the Board shared their recommendations for actions that Pinterest should take to ensure that our workplace is inclusive, fair, and respectful. Their independent look at our culture and practices with WilmerHale focused on ways to improve our working environment and our internal policies and practices. Please take time to read through the recommendations. I want us all to know and internalize what’s in this report. We are committed to making the recommended changes and plan to update you on how we’ll be taking action, including committing resources, sharing a roadmap, and reporting on progress. Building an inclusive culture requires clarity about what we need to do to get there. That’s why I want to thank all of you, and all of our former colleagues, who spoke with WilmerHale. Your voices and perspectives helped us get so much of this clarity. I’m grateful to all of you. We will talk about all of this at our Q&A later this week where you can ask questions about what’s on your mind. Before then, I want to share a few thoughts on what I imagine are the most common questions. What happens with these recommendations? Because this review was independent, the Leadership Team didn’t see this report until it was sent to every employee. We’ll need a bit of time to fully absorb it. After a quick review, I was encouraged to see that many of their suggestions mirror efforts we already have underway to build a culture where all employees feel included and supported. I was also heartened to see new suggestions and approaches that we can implement to better our culture. Why should we be confident that we’ll act on these recommendations? I’m confident because we’re already taking important steps forward together. Progress never comes as fast as any of us want. But, when I look at what we’ve done in the past few months to build a great culture, we’re making progress. Here are a few examples: Appointed Tyi as our Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity, reporting directly to me Added diversity to our Board of Directors Launched a number of efforts—like implementing a diverse slate requirement—to improve representation in our workforce, especially at senior levels Revamped and expanded our inclusion training for all employees Established business goals to increase the representation of content Pinterest shows to Pinners Announced a partnership with the NAACP to form an Inclusion Advisory Council Where do we go from here? Over the past months, I’ve met with employees from all levels, teams, and regions. So many of you have been candid with your concerns. So, these recommendations aren’t surprising. But, they were still hard to read. That’s because I want Pinterest to be an inspiring company with the best culture we can possibly build. We’ve made progress this year. It’s going to be a long journey— one that will require sustained focus and commitment. We’re not there yet. But, with hard work, I know we will get there. I’m looking forward to working with all of you to implement these recommendations in 2021.

In addition the NAACP’s leadership and guidance, the Inclusion Advisory Council will also include Joshua DuBois. DuBois served as a director for the Obama presidential campaign and is currently the CEO of Values Partnerships, a consulting firm focused on social impact. The Inclusion Advisory Council will meet regularly with a dedicated group of Pinterest’s leadership team — including CEO Ben Silbermann and Tyi McCray, Pinterest's Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity — to review progress against diversity goals, make recommendations to further promote the creation of inclusive features and content, and provide guidance centered on company culture. Additional organizations and experts will be selected to join the council based on their breadth of experience navigating key issues in underserved communities. “We’re continuing to take steps to make Pinterest a company with an inspired culture where all employees are empowered and valued, as we build a product that reflects our diverse population of Pinners around the world,” said Ben Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest. “Evolving our strategies and actions, alongside experts in the space, will help us create meaningful and lasting change.” “Inclusion and diversity is not only a value; it’s foundational to making the best decisions and building the strongest teams,” said Tyi McCray, Pinterest’s Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity. “The commitment to this work is a priority across the organization and we are incredibly grateful to the NAACP and Joshua DuBois for their partnership.” “This moment of reckoning demands that all organizations not only affirm their commitment to continuing to build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture, but to take the steps necessary to bring about progress,” said Yumeka Rushing, NAACP Chief Strategy Officer. “We are excited to partner with Pinterest to bring together diverse voices and help to drive impactful change.” “We are proud to work with Pinterest on this critically important Advisory Board.

While life in quarantine has been unexpected, it hasn’t stopped people from planning and looking ahead to the future. In fact, there’s been a 35% year-over-year increase in the number of monthly boards created1 . Additionally, there’s been significant growth in boards created in top Pinterest categories, including a 44% increase in beauty, a 95% increase in women's fashion and a 36% increase in home decor2 . That’s why today we’re introducing features to boards to make it easier to plan and manifest all of that visual inspiration from Pinterest into real life, with new notes to self directly on Pins, board favorites and a board toolbar. What’s new Notes to self is a new section on saved Pins to add private notes to make it easy to come back to and take action, like “try this for brunch” or “this will go well with the living room rug”. With active boards containing on average more than 150 Pins, the new board toolbar makes it easier to sort through Pins with an easy-to-navigate section at the top of the screen showing all of the actions that can be taken on a board — from exploring more ideas related to Pins to organizing, accessing notes, and even to-do lists. Board favorites - We’re testing a feature that enables Pinners to mark top Pins as a favorite by tapping the star icon on the Pins in their boards. Sort boards by favorite Pins and make it easier to find top ideas and take action. Emerging trends3 This year, newly created boards titled “dream lifestyle” increased 3x as Pinners plan what to shop, figure out new routines, and how to improve their homes while on lockdown. Additional planning trends include: Quarantine babies In the past six months, there’s been a historical surge in boards created for baby products. The number of Pinterest boards created for shopping and wish list-ing with titles like “baby products” are now 78x greater. That means more people than ever are turning to Pinterest to plan for the baby items they’ll need, which might just match to impending quarantine babies born 9-10 months after quarantine first began. Home improvement As people look for ways to make their home more efficient for working and schooling from home, outdoor living, more cooking from home, and family entertainment options, newly created boards for home improvement projects with titles including, “homeschool room design” (11x), “furniture projects” (+68%), and “small home gyms” (+48%) have been skyrocketing. At-home workouts More time at home and less commuting means defining balance for the self, driving an increase in fitness and wellness boards with titles like, “workout videos” (6x), “gym workout for beginners” (7x), and “grounding exercises” (5x). Shopping from the saves to the splurges With changing needs throughout quarantine, and as some have saved money from not traveling or other expenses, Pinners are shopping for a range of products. There’s been an 83% increase in “everyday essential products” boards and an 83% increase in “my dream closet” boards. And there are more people planning for holiday gifts this year, with a 70% increase in “family Christmas gifts” boards. In searches, queries for \"personalized Christmas gift ideas\" are up 46%, and searches for “luxury gifts” up 3x. \"As a home chef who is growing my brand rapidly, I am learning so much from my followers as they cook my recipes. They offer amazing ideas, insight and feedback - so being able to take notes on each Pin allows me a place to quickly jot down these things as they come up!” -Pinterest creator Grossy Pelosi Did you know? Boards are also a great place for creators to collaborate with each other, brands or Pinners and showcase their ideas by adding contributors. Organize ideas with a 'board within a board' using sections or sort boards alphabetically. Also add shopping or to-do lists to a board to make it easy to take action. When a project is complete, archive the board to stop getting recommendations for that project. Whatever the board name, project, or if it’s a group board or secret board, here’s to making those Pins a reality.

Remember shopping? Remember heading out for a new pair of jeans and ending up with a whole new outfit? Remember how much…fun it was? Online shopping, on the other hand, hasn’t brought shoppers much joy. Until now. In fact, alongside an unprecedented acceleration in e-commerce, holiday shopping started earlier than ever on Pinterest this year. Searches spiked in April for queries like “christmas gift ideas” (+3x yoy). And, the number of Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces on Pinterest has grown over 85% in the past six months. At Pinterest, we believe there’s a difference between shopping and buying: inspiration. A more inspired online shopping experience takes the best of shopping everywhere and makes it possible anywhere. Today we’re introducing our newest suite of merchant tools to help retailers reach customers this holiday season and beyond, including a new storefront profile, faster Catalogs feed ingestion, collections as a shopping ad format, video for collections, automatic bidding, conversion insights and analysis, and an improved product tagging test. Here’s how we’re taking what retailers (and shoppers) loved about offline shopping and bringing it online: New Ways To Set Up Shop Merchant storefront profile & discovery: helping brands get discovered and inspiring more shoppers. An updated profile enables merchants to transform their shop tab into a storefront with featured in-stock products organized by category, featured product groups and dynamically-created recommendations. And when Pinners search for shopping-related ideas on Pinterest, they’ll see recommended merchants based on the product category. New product tagging: We’re testing an improved product tagging tool that gives merchants the ability to tag their own scene images with exact products. The update makes it more seamless for shoppers to shop from a scene to make that inspiration a reality. Catalogs updates: a more intuitive interface so it’s easier to become a merchant on Pinterest. It’s now faster and simpler for merchants to upload their catalogs and activate shopping ads, with faster Catalog feed ingestion, video as the main hero image in collections, collections as a new shopping ad format, and a new preferred scheduling tool that lets retailers upload all products to Pinterest on their own time. Faster catalogs ingestion Some products just belong together. That’s why we’re bringing together Catalogs and collections to make collections a shopping ad format. As part of this update, brands can now also select a main asset and a corresponding product group to create an inspiring, multi-image ad unit. Additionally, we’re launching the option to use video as a hero in a Collections ad unit to further tell a brand story. Advertisers who used collections saw a 6-18% increase in average total basket size. New Ways To Scale Sales Automatic bidding for shopping: Set it and forget it with automatic bidding for catalog sales in ad campaigns. Now, retailers can maximize their budget without constantly checking their buy. Automatic bidding for shopping means advertisers can dynamically adjust an ad group’s bid to aim for the maximum number of results. No guesswork. No waiting around. Just easy, automatic and effective. On average, advertisers who tested Automatic Bidding for Catalog Sales saw 28% more conversions when optimizing for the ‘Conversion’ event and nearly 29% more clicks when optimizing for ‘Click’ event for the same budget. New Ways To Prove Impact Conversion Analysis: a more granular look at conversion performance. With new updates, retailers can see how customers are completing their path to purchase—all summarized in a familiar funnel—in the visualizations tool. Follow customers’ purchase journey and compare multiple attribution views to prove impact. These are just the latest updates in our growing suite of shopping solutions, all designed to help brands inspire more sales, while creating a richer experience that inspires customers to shop—not just to buy.

With searches on the platform for topics like “indie ios 14 homescreen” (15x), “widget iPhone aesthetic” (19x), “Neon icons for apps” (14x) or “Black and white icons for apps” (14x)1 surging in the past few weeks, it was clear Pinners wanted Pinterest to be part of their iOS 14 home screen, and make use of the new customization features now available on their phones. So much of the content on Pinterest — from inspirational quotes to seasonal image and fashion ideas — are perfect matches for that wallpaper aesthetic. Simply hold an area on your screen and tap the plus sign in the upper-left corner to choose from widgets. Select the widget’s size and add to your home screen. Select a board of yours or one you follow. The image on the widget will change on hourly or daily basis, depending on the Pinner’s preferences, with an option to add a small or large-sized widget (medium-size isn’t optimal for Pin length). Tapping the widget will direct to that Pin in the app. To move the widget, hold it and place it in the best spot. Pinners are looking for ways to continuously update their home screen aesthetics for inspiration, wellbeing and positivity, from seasonality — from Halloween decor to fall recipes, quotes, and wander-lusting with travel ideas, and more. The new widget is available now to Pinners around the world.

With the recent introduction of Story Pins and popular trending spaces, we’re committed to ensuring that 50% of the managed creators we’re working with come from underrepresented groups. And, in the coming weeks, we’re introducing a new way for retailers of all sizes, advertisers and creators to self-identify if they’re from an underrepresented group so their content will appear in these emerging spaces, including the Today tab, Shopping Spotlights and The Pinterest Shop. Those with business profiles who are interested can update their information in the settings menu under “Community Information”. We’re also proud to share the launch of our “Make the World See All Beauty” campaign, to start a new conversation around beauty and representation. Launching with a social film and V Magazine cover wrap, Pinterest and ten boundary-pushing creators show us a more representative future with makers including Nyma Tang. Through self-captured content from beauty creators, the film invites people to join our mission to make the beauty world see all beauty, furthering Pinterest’s position on making all areas of beauty more representative. The campaign will go live on Pinterest creator social channels and will also feature related ideas with exclusive content in Story Pins from creators like Tennille Murphy, Kiitan Akinniranye and Nam Vo. Over the coming months, we’re continuing to make progress on our commitments to support meaningful change—whether it’s increasing the discoverability of diverse ideas to reflect our hundreds of millions of Pinners, using our marketing channels to help drive change, or our amplifying creators from all backgrounds and experiences."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-appoints-salaam-coleman-smith-to-board-of-directors","date":"2020-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News"],"title":"Pinterest Appoints Former Disney Executive Salaam Coleman Smith to Board of Directors","text":"Pinterest, Inc. announced today it has appointed Salaam Coleman Smith, former Executive Vice President of Programming and Strategy at Disney’s ABC Family and Freeform and former President of Comcast NBCUniversal’s Style Media, to its Board of Directors effective October 31, 2020.

That’s why this week, we’re rolling out new shopping tools for Pinners and advertisers, bringing us one step closer to our goal of making every Pin shoppable. Pinterest is launching ads alongside visual search results, as well as more places to shop, and with new conversion insights, advertisers can easily see the impact of both their paid and organic Pinterest content. In addition, we’re expanding shopping tools for Pinners in the UK, bringing shopping inspiration to a new market. When browsing the aisles of a favorite store isn’t possible, shoppers increasingly are turning to Pinterest for inspiration. The percentage of users who visited places to shop on Pinterest grew more than 50% in the first half of 2020. But we know shopping is more than searching for a singular product—it’s about inspiring new ideas. We’re focused on making that experience as inspirational as possible, just like flipping through the pages of a favorite catalog or walking through the aisles of a store that feels handpicked. New monetized shopping experiences and conversion insights As more people use Pinterest to shop and look for ideas and products from brands and retailers, we’re integrating ads into more shopping experiences across Pinterest to deliver relevant content where it’s welcomed by shoppers, in the U.S. and UK. We’re introducing more places for retailers to promote Pins and showcase ads where Pinners love to shop most, including visual search results. Retailers have been eager to be able to deliver their catalog content within these new Pinner experiences. Three of our most highly trafficked and visible places to shop - Lens search in Pins, the shop tab in search, and shopping on Pins (coming soon) - can include ads. With new conversion insights in the U.S., Pinterest Verified Merchants and Shopify retailers can easily see the impact of both their paid and organic Pinterest content on their site visits and checkouts, making their shopping efforts not just impactful, but also measurable. They’ll be able to analyze performance, view top converting Pins and turn their best performing organic Pins into ads. In addition, they’ll be able to track their activity funnel and see how Pinterest audiences converted on the path to purchase— from page visitors, to Pinners who added to cart, to purchasers. Introducing shopping in the UK We’re also creating more opportunities for global Pinners to shop with an expansion of our latest organic shopping products. We’re bringing shopping inspiration to the UK, one of our top markets, with features that have been embraced by shoppers in the U.S. With the launch of these features, UK Pinners will be able to shop within a home or fashion Pin, shop their search results, from their boards and shop the inspiration they see in the real world through Lens camera visual search. They’ll also be able to get inspiration from Shopping spotlights, which are expert-selected shoppable content curated with publishers and creators. We’re kicking the experience off with publishers including Stylist, who has curated local products as part of the Pinterest x Stylist Shop, and creators like The Anna Edit who has curated her dream product wishlist of minimalist interior design must-haves. A place to shop online, not just a place to buy Instead of walking down New York’s 5th Ave to see the holiday windows, holiday inspiration will likely be from the comfort of our own phones. In a year when more people than ever will be shopping online for the holiday, Pinterest can replicate that experience for consumers and retailers through curated collections and visual discovery. We’re building a place to shop online—not just a place to buy. Visit our holiday hub for fresh insights, best practices and creative thought-starters."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/introducing-new-ways-for-creators-to-build-and-grow-with-pinterest","date":"2020-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","Product"],"title":"Introducing Story Pins and new ways for creators to build and grow with Pinterest","text":"Pinterest has always been the place to discover ideas and the inspiration to go do them— from recipes to beauty tutorials, style and home ideas, and more. Today we’re introducing the biggest updates for creators yet, to connect them to our growing audience looking for positivity. We’re launching a suite of creator-first features including Story Pins in beta, a new creator profile and analytics tools to track performance. These new publishing and measurement tools will give creators ways to easily publish immersive and expansive stories directly to Pinterest and reach Pinners looking for inspirational ideas and people to follow. Meet Story Pins, where ideas are turned into stories Story Pins is an all new type of Pin and publishing option that gives creators a way to tell dynamic and visual stories with videos, voiceover and image and text overlay. We’re making it easier for creators who are eager to share their talent, passions and creativity to flow back directly into Pinterest without the need for a website. For Pinners, this means the ideas within a Pin will be more engaging and actionable. From creators to hobbyists to publishers, our vision is to make Pinterest a platform where anyone can publish great ideas and discover great content. Creators with early access to Story Pins like Coco Bassey, Camille Styles, Shiquita from Unconventional Southern Belle, and Jazmine Ford of Finding Uphoria have already grown their audiences, with fashion ideas like this fall lookbook, beauty inspiration like makeup looks using products from Black-owned businesses, a how-to on lemon ricotta cake and a fitness routine for a full leg workout. Find more great Story Pin examples here. Like all Pins, Story Pins can be saved to boards for later, and will be discoverable over time. They’ll also be distributed across home feed, search results and places like the Today tab, and benefit from the visual discovery engine that matches new ideas to people with relevant interests and tastes. Ensuring fresh, positive and inspirational ideas are always discoverable on Pinterest is a key priority of ours. Creators are the heart and soul of Pinterest, building content that inspires people around the world. We want Pinterest to be a place not just to be inspired, but a platform where people can inspire others. Publish directly to Pinterest Creators with access to Story Pins can use the Pinterest camera to record video, add multiple images as well as text with custom fonts. To help Pinners take action on their ideas, creators can also add a detail page with ingredients or DIY materials. Story Pins also make it easier for creators to build an audience on Pinterest since they aren’t ephemeral and don’t disappear after 24-hours. To ensure ideas get in front of the Pinners who are looking for them, creators can tag Story Pins or videos with topics or interests fueled by the trends and insights on the platform. Introducing new creator profiles We’re updating creator profiles to feature creator’s ideas front and center and showcase their published content, not just the ideas they’ve saved. Pinners can now message creators via the Contact or Message card. Pinners can also react to the ideas they discover from their favorite creators with a range of positive reactions like “Great idea,” “Love,” “Wow,” and “Thanks” to provide feedback to creators. Creators and Pinners can further interact with image and text comments after they’ve tried an idea as Pinners share their own take. We believe ideas from creators deserve more than just a double tap. Building an audience and measuring reach The best part of creating for Pinterest is seeing how ideas impact Pinners. To track performance and progress, we’re also launching new analytics tools as well as an engagement tab, where creators can like or respond to photos on Pins in one place, making it easier for creators to connect with their audience. With Pin Stats, creators can see key metrics like impressions and engagement. And our redesigned Analytics dashboard shows a detailed view of how content is performing - like the categories and interests audiences engage with most. Over the past few years, we’ve seen creators and brands partner through collaborations and sponsorships to bring new ideas to our Pinners. We’ll continue working on ways to support creators in these efforts. We’re starting out Story Pins with select creators in the U.S. and will continue rolling out access and improvements over the coming months to international creators. All other features are live for Pinners with business accounts today. Creators interested in learning more about Story Pins and creator tools can sign up here.

On Pinterest, you can be inspired by what other people create, discover something new that brings you joy, or learn something useful to try in your day-to-day life. While most people don’t visit Pinterest with politics in mind, our platform can be a place to find ideas about civic engagement. Earlier this year, we shared our initiatives on civic engagement, including our work with the Census Bureau on the 2020 U.S. Census. Now, as we head into the U.S. elections, we’re taking further steps to strengthen our commitment to sharing reliable information on where and how to vote, tackling false and misleading content that could interfere with the election, and encouraging and supporting employees to participate in civic engagement as they’d like. Connecting voters to reliable resources Now, when people search on Pinterest for topics like how to vote or presidential candidates, we’ll show a banner that leads to Vote.org, a non-partisan resource where you can register to vote, check registration status, get an absentee ballot, and more. Pinners will also have access to more voting resources in the Today tab, a source of daily inspiration with curated topics and trending ideas like how to organize a ballot research party or how to engage kids on civic topics. Encouraging responsible civic engagement As we get closer to Election Day, we know public discourse will grow louder. We want Pinterest to remain a place for inspiration and positivity. That’s why, as we near November, we’ll limit recommendations about election-related content (like election memes or slogans) in places like the home feed and notifications. We'll also turn off search autocomplete and search guides for specific election-related terms. One important piece of our platform that will remain: You will never see political campaign ads on Pinterest. Since 2018, we have not accepted ads for the selection or defeat of political candidates running for public office; political parties or action committees; political issues with the intent to influence an election; or legislation, including referendums or ballot initiatives. Additionally, we will not monetize elections-related content. That means we won’t show ads when you search for common election-related search terms like presidential or vice-presidential candidate names, “polling place,” and “vote.” We believe that’s a better and more inspiring experience for everyone. Curbing the spread of misinformation We’re committed to combating misinformation on Pinterest — and in this election season, that commitment is stronger than ever. Our community guidelines prohibit false or misleading content that impedes an election’s integrity or an individual's or group's civic participation, such as registering to vote, voting, or being counted in a census. There are no exceptions to this rule — including for public figures. While we’ve already had this policy in place, ahead of the election we’ve expanded on our guidelines to be even more transparent about what is or is not allowed on our platform. We also make it easy for anyone to report civic misinformation. Fighting misinformation is complex and always evolving. It takes an entire ecosystem to support the effort, which is why we work with others in the industry as well as third party experts and organizations, like Graphika, a leader in network analysis. This collaboration supports the integrity of our platform as we hold ourselves accountable to our policies ahead of the elections. Supporting our employees' civic engagement We're also turning our commitment to responsible civic engagement inward toward our own team. Pinterest is offering all employees eight hours of paid time off, the equivalent of a full work day, for whichever type of civic engagement they prefer — like going to vote or serving as a poll worker. We believe participating in the democratic process can be inspiring, and we want Pinterest to be a place where people can find credible information that inspires them to participate fully in their communities."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/tyi-mccray-joins-pinterest-as-global-head-of-inclusion-and-diversity","date":"2020-07-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News"],"title":"Tyi McCray joins Pinterest as Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity","text":"Today we’re announcing Tyi McCray as our new Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity at Pinterest.

We set clear goals to increase the representation of content we show to Pinners, and announced an audit that is being conducted by outside experts to help us take additional actions on our workplace culture. Over the past months, we’ve gained momentum on cultural action plans that will increase inclusion and diversity at Pinterest in our employee experience, product, policies, processes and community. Community Rebuild Program We worked with our employee resource group Blackboard to create a Community Rebuild Program as a resource for minority-owned businesses to help them adapt to the new way of operating due to the pandemic. As part of the program, we are offering support, including financial assistance such as paid media, creative resources, account management, and education about how to become successful on Pinterest and generate more exposure for their businesses. We have already partnered with some minority-owned organizations, and we expect to add more in the coming months so we create a seamless way for business to receive support and resources to successfully use Pinterest to establish a digital presence by creating high-quality content and widespread exposure. A more inclusive product We hear from Pinners that they want to feel represented and discover inspiration relevant to their interests, so we’ve been rolling out features to customize beauty searches by skin tone range. We recently expanded our skin tone range feature to five additional countries. The design of this feature has also been refreshed so that people can easily filter beauty-related results by skin tone right from the search results page. In addition, the quality of the technology has also improved, and the number of beauty and fashion Pins where a skin tone can be identified has quadrupled.

As Pinterest becomes more shoppable with a growing set of diverse content, today we’re announcing updates to skin tone ranges and the addition of new brands to virtually shop and try on lipsticks through AR Try on. These updates increase the discoverability of beauty products and tutorials personalized to individual skin tone, style, and preference.

We know that building a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace for every employee is fundamentally important for Pinterest. Our decision to commission an independent review reporting to the Special Committee is a critical step. We look forward to doing an objective assessment to identify opportunities for improving our culture and our company. The WilmerHale review will include an in-depth assessment of Pinterest’s policies and practices concerning discrimination, harassment, and other workplace issues. WilmerHale will also review and assess the way Pinterest evaluates, promotes, and compensates employees and how the company responds to and investigates complaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Danielle Conley, co-chair of WilmerHale’s Anti-Discrimination Practice and a former Associate Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice, will lead the team. Ms. Conley and the WilmerHale team have significant experience conducting internal reviews of this nature. Note from Co-founder and CEO Ben Silbermann to Pinterest Employees Hi Everyone, Over the last few weeks we’ve been having important conversations about what steps we need to take to improve our culture. Thanks to so many of you for contributing. I’m encouraged by the broad participation as well as the desire to move quickly on the items outlined during our June 17th Q&A and my note to the team. To name a few positive first steps from the last couple weeks: We strengthened our diverse slate requirement for recruiting as we work to improve representation, especially at senior levels. We set clear goals to increase the representation of content we show to Pinners. We are revamping our Unconscious Bias and Leading Inclusive Teams trainings. These expanded offerings will be available to every employee by the end of July. These are just the first steps in a long journey. Thanks to everyone for personally committing to this work. As a reminder, all of the company and team-specific goals are due at the end of H2 planning. Progress against these goals will be reviewed just like any of our business OKRs. Today, I want to share an additional important workstream. A Special Committee of the Pinterest Board of Directors has engaged Danielle Conley of WilmerHale to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of our policies and practices concerning discrimination, harassment, and other workplace issues. The WilmerHale team will also review and assess the way Pinterest evaluates, promotes, and compensates employees, and how the company responds to and investigates complaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Danielle will report directly to this Special Committee of the Board to ensure independence. This is a good thing for Pinterest because it will provide us with the most objective assessment of where we are and the opportunities we have to improve our culture moving forward. I’m fully supportive of this independent evaluation as well as Danielle and the WilmerHale team. Danielle is a partner in WilmerHale’s Washington D.C. office where she co-chairs the firm’s Anti-Discrimination Practice. She regularly conducts internal investigations regarding allegations of race and gender discrimination and other workplace culture issues for technology companies. Danielle previously served as Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of Justice where she provided strategic counsel to senior government officials on a broad range of civil rights policy issues and managed some of DOJ’s most significant and high- profile civil rights litigation and enforcement actions. If the WilmerHale team reaches out to you, please prioritize following up. This is important work that will help us make Pinterest better.

This has got to change. Because people are being murdered. And Black Lives Matter. We want to express not only our solidarity but also our commitment to taking action. Not just now, but from now on. Our team, with input from outside experts, identified steps we believe will make a difference over time. On our platform: We are elevating content on racial justice, such as resources for how parents can talk to their children; organizations users can support; and educational information about systemic racism in America. We are working to make sure the content people see on Pinterest represents people from diverse backgrounds. We are investing more resources into growing the diversity of content on our platform. We won’t serve ads on Black Lives Matter results, so people can focus on learning about the movement. Within our company: We will continue to make progress on improving the diversity of our company, with a deeper focus on increasing the diversity of senior leaders.

Over the years we’ve greatly improved the results that appear when you snap a photo with Lens camera search, to match related suggestions and products to buy. There are 3x as many visual searches using the Pinterest camera than last year. Today, we’re launching a shop tab right on Lens results. Just click the camera in the search bar, snap or upload a photo, and see a “Shop” tab with a feed of shoppable Pins based on the in-stock products we've identified in that image. Every Product Pin links directly to the checkout page on the retailer's site. Snap and shop Have worn-down running shoes and want to purchase a similar style from a different brand? Use Lens to shop in-stock products. You can also upload a screenshot you’ve snapped from another app or an older photo from your camera roll – such as artwork, a rug or pillows — and Lens will tell you what it is and where you can purchase it. Lens can take images from offline or online and show you similar items for sale, from a range of retailers and price points. It’s harder to browse the aisles of your favorite stores these days, but with Lens, you can browse the online catalogs of retailers to discover new products you’ll love. Top-shopped Lens finds Around half of the items snapped through Lens belong to the fashion or home decor category. The top-shopped products with Lens are prints & artwork, shirts & tops, dresses, shoes, jackets, vases, mirrors, rugs, pants and throw pillows. In the past few months, there have been increasing searches on Pinterest for at-home beauty products such as press on nails (+30%), while searches related to sweatpants have decreased 12% from February to April. Meanwhile, “home office” searches are the highest they’ve ever been, growing 2.7x from February to April. Heading outside, searches for “backyard furniture” spike every spring, but there have been record highs for these searches this May, 3x greater than last year. And, as Pinners make every grocery store trip count during COVID, there have been record highs in searches for “grocery shopping list”, which have doubled this April compared to February. One of the unique ways to use Pinterest for shopping has been visual search. Whether you want to search a particular object within a larger Pin, or use the camera to find similar products — if you see it, you can shop it. The magic of Lens is it can help you shop even when you don’t have the words for a text search. While you have your Lens camera open, click “try on” to use augmented reality to test out different shoppable lip colors from the comfort of your home. As shopping looks a bit different these days, we’re helping retailers of all sizes bring their products to Pinterest and give shoppers the ability to discover something wonderful and unexpected from trusted merchants.

Today we’re launching a new app with Shopify that gives their more than one million merchants a quick way to upload catalogs to Pinterest and turn their products into shoppable Product Pins, in just a few clicks. The Pinterest app on Shopify includes a suite of shopping features like tag installation, catalog ingestion, automatic daily updating of products, and an ads buying interface. For Shopify merchants, this means easy set up and access to distribution across Pinterest with or without ads, as well as reporting and results tracking to maximize reach. The app automatically creates a connection between the individual store and Pinterest, so the merchant doesn’t need to edit code or add development resources, making it seamless for businesses of all sizes. Once installed, the app will allow a merchant to deploy a tag on their website, upload their product catalog and quickly publish in-stock Product Pins. Businesses will also see a shop tab appear on their profile as an additional way for their products to be discovered. By uploading their catalog feed, merchants make it possible for people to discover and save their products and buy directly from their website. People come to Pinterest with an intent to plan and purchase. The number of Pinners who have engaged with shoppable Product Pins has increased 44% year-over-year, and total traffic to retailers has increased by 2.3x year-over-year. And, due in part to early beta testing with Shopify, catalog feed uploads increased 144% in the first quarter of the year. Shopify merchants in the U.S. and Canada can install the tag starting today, and the integration will go live to merchants in countries where Pinterest ads are available including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK in the coming months. Quote from Jeremy King, SVP of Technology, Pinterest: As we make Pinterest more shoppable, Shopify is the perfect partner for bringing access to catalogs, Product Pins and shopping ads to merchants so they can get in front of the millions of Pinners looking for unique products that match their taste. With the new Pinterest app on Shopify, in just a few clicks, retailers can take the products on their virtual store shelves to the recommendations Pinners see as they shop. Merchants are adapting to new realities and looking ahead to the future of retail, which is why we're focused on making both our ads and organic features available and impactful to businesses of all sizes. Quote from Satish Kanwar, VP of Product, Shopify: Partnering with Pinterest to create the Pinterest channel is adding another powerful marketing tool for merchants to share their products with a new audience. The channel allows merchants to easily turn their Shopify products into shoppable Pins for Pinterest’s over 350 million users to discover, allowing Pinterest users to purchase the item directly from the merchant’s store. The channel also makes it even easier for merchants to advertise to and acquire new customers, which is a huge win for businesses.

You’ll start to see more of the Pinterest Creators brand in the coming weeks, but you can get a feel for the new look here:"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/sustainability","date":"2020-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Pinterest for Business"],"title":"The Pinterest Shop launches sustainable collection featuring small businesses","text":"Supporting creators, makers and small business has always been at our core, and in light of the COVID-19 crisis, this is more important now than ever. Over the last few weeks, Pinterest searches for “support small business” have increased 351% as Pinners look for individual makers and companies to shop online1. In honor of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we’re launching a brand new collection of products from sustainable brands on the Pinterest Shop. Since the Shop’s November launch, it’s provided a convenient place to discover one-of-a-kind businesses and shop unique products. The latest curated collection features hundreds of shoppable products (click Pin to go straight to checkout on the retailer’s site) from 21 small and medium-sized businesses. To mark the launch, Lauren Conrad has curated her own board of favorite eco-friendly products from her brand The Little Market. We know Pinners are looking to do their part too, with searches for \"eco-friendly living\" (+93%), \"zero waste products\" (+108%), and \"sustainable gifts\" (+73%) all on the rise2.

In the last two weeks, searches for “help small businesses” on Pinterest are up 3x compared to the prior two weeks, while searches for “home office setup” are up by 70% as people look for ideas to furnish their new work-from-home spaces. Searches for gifts for others are also up. In the past two weeks, there’s been a 4x increase in searches for “employee gifts” and searches for “care package ideas” have doubled. One of the ways we want to help Pinners explore products for themselves, their home or loved ones is by making it easier to discover new brands, while bringing traffic to retailers small and big like Ruggable, Room & Board, Filson, The Citizenry, Made Trade, and Ansel & Ivy. 97% of top searches on Pinterest are unbranded, meaning people come to Pinterest to shop for generic terms and not specific brands, leveling the playing field for businesses of all sizes to be discovered. Today we’re announcing new ways to shop right from Pins, on boards, from search, and through new browsable recommendations for home decor. Shop from a board: When a Pinner visits their home decor or fashion board, they’ll now see a Shop tab that shows products from or inspired by the Pins on their board. Just as if a shopping list has been created for their boards, Pinners will see in-stock products based on what they’ve been saving for a room or look. Shop from search: Beginning to roll out today, a new shop tab will appear on search, making it easy to shop in-stock products from a range of retailers when searching for terms like “spring outfits\", \"office decor\", \"kitchen remodel\". We’ve also added price and brand filters to the experience. Shop from Pins: We’ve made updates to visual search to make it easier to shop products right from the Pin. Just click “shop similar” to see related in-stock products for looks and rooms. Style guides: When searching for home-related terms like “living room ideas”, browsable style guides will appear for home ideas in popular styles like mid-century, contemporary and rustic. These visual recommendations make it possible to explore trending styles and taste even when you don’t have the words to describe what you’re looking for. It’s like having an interior designer right in search. We’re also working to make it easy to shop from retailers who have met our guidelines for a trusted experience, which is why we recently launched the Verified Merchant program. Now, Pinners will see a blue checkmark on the profiles of the growing number of verified merchants. As we continue to make improvements to the shopping experience on Pinterest, we’ve increased the number of shoppable Product Pins by 2.5x since last year, while driving a total increase in traffic to retailers by 2.3x. And, the number of Pinners engaging with shopping on Pinterest has increased 44% year over year. Brands interested in learning more about reaching shoppers on Pinterest can join a webinar today (April 7) at 11am PT/2pm ET with Pinterest’s Global Head of Retail Strategy Amy Vener, and find new videos with tips for success on our here.

As consumers shift their spending to online channels, brands should inspire Pinners and create a shopping experience that feels more like “real life,” bringing a sense of normalcy and delight to challenging times. People have always used Pinterest for shopping inspiration, and it’s been a priority of ours to surface the best products from retailers to people who are ready to shop at the right time. Because Pinners come to Pinterest in search of inspiration (and not necessarily with specific products in mind), and also welcome content from brands, our interests are aligned across the board. As we continue to invest in shopping and the success of retailers, we’re introducing new features to help retailers of all sizes get discovered, and distribute their products in the spaces where Pinners are most likely to shop, including the launch of the Verified Merchant Program, new conversion reporting opportunities, and updates to Catalogs and dynamic retargeting. Pinners are shoppers — looking for inspirational ideas especially in areas like home, self-care, and kids activities right now Shoppers are turning to Pinterest as a key shopping destination: a place to get inspired and discover new ideas as a refreshing alternative to news and politics. They’re walking the virtual aisles of the platform, searching for visual ideas to help them create their new reality. In the past two weeks, we’ve seen increases in searches (compared to the prior two weeks) for topics like “home organization” (+43%), “spa day at home” (+19%), “makeup tutorial for beginners” (+180%), and “kid-friendly recipes” (+64%). NEW! Introducing Verified Merchants, Conversion Insights & Catalogs updates Verified Merchant Program: We’ve launched the Verified Merchant Program with retailers like Quay Australia, Ruggable, Filson, Coyuchi and Lotuff Leather, who’ve met our qualifications for high quality customer service experiences through manual review. Verified Merchants will display a special blue checkmark on their profiles, and become eligible for increased distribution within high-intent shopping experiences and metrics like conversion reporting. Retailers interested in signing up for the program can learn more at pinterest.com/verified. Conversion Insights: Gain early access to organic and paid conversion insights so you can measure Pinterest’s impact on your site visits, checkouts and sales over multiple attribution windows. Catalogs updates: We’ve made significant updates to Catalogs that lessen the time from feed ingestion to Product Pin creation, plus we’re adding new metrics, near real-time feed ingestion, user experience enhancements, and feed ingestion scheduling. Dynamic retargeting: Advertisers in global markets can reach Pinners who have previously engaged with their brand online or who have unpurchased items in their cart by retargeting exact or similar products they search and save on Pinterest. We're adding in more optimization levers to give advertisers more control."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-the-today-tab-for-daily-inspiration","date":"2020-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing the Today tab for daily inspiration","text":"There’s no question life feels different these days. The spread of COVID-19 is disrupting lives around the world, but it’s been heartening to see people willing and eager to do their part to fight this virus by staying home. As people adjust to a new normal, they’re coming to Pinterest to stay inspired. In fact, over the last weekend, we saw an all-time high around the world with more saves and searches on the platform than any other weekend in our history. There has also been significant growth in use cases like planning what to cook, finding lesson plans and craft projects for kids, and tips for growing vegetables. And in the U.S., more people than ever were sending Pins to one another and idea sharing, with messages sent through our Send a Pin feature up 34%. People need ideas today. So we’re moving up our launch of the Today tab, a source of daily inspiration with curated topics and trending Pins that makes it easy to explore popular and timely ideas. Over the coming weeks we’ll be featuring expert information here from the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control on topics like hand washing during the coronavirus epidemic. In addition, we’re also showing inspiration in categories that are particularly popular right now like kid-friendly baking ideas, self-care tips, family-favorite movies and comfort food recipes. Just click “Today” at the top of your home feed from your iOS or Android app for new ideas each day. Recommendations will include a handful of topics. We’ll start with ideas curated by the Pinterest team and in the future will also feature guest editors. While the home feed continues to show personalized recommendations, the Today tab will show popular ideas based on what's going on in the world and trending searches. Making emotional well-being activities more available In the past few weeks, searches for “calming quotes” doubled and “stress relief” and \"stress quotes\" have tripled, and so we’re also starting to roll out compassionate search on web, to make the mental wellness feature available on all platforms. That means when you search for terms like “stress relief” from your desktop computer or phone, you’ll see the options to check out a collection of emotional wellbeing activities to help relax and feel better with content from emotional health experts. Or, you can head directly to https://wellbeing.pinterest.com/.These are just some of our efforts to make reliable and expert information easily accessible on Pinterest, in addition to: A custom search experience featuring results from experts (image here) Prohibiting ads that claim to offer cures or treatments or that are looking to exploit the crisis A banner across the site that directs to WHO facts An easy way to report health misinformation through the \"health misinformation\" option on Pins. We're removing any misinformation we find about COVID-19 because it violates our health misinformation policy (which has been in place since 2017) Stay safe, stay inspired As people around the world come to Pinterest looking for inspiration, we’ll surface ideas in the Today tab in the U.S. and the U.K., with more countries to come, and in places like home feed and search in additional places. For example, last weekend, we saw the highest rates of user engagement in the history of the platform in countries like Italy, France, Spain and Germany. In France for instance, saves are up almost 30% vs. last month. In the U.S., searches for “freezer meals” are up 155% in the past two weeks (compared to previous two), “working from home” up 170% and “indoor activities with kids” up 1,300%. The Today tab on mobile apps is now available in the U.S. and the U.K. and is expanding to 13 new countries: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico and Switzerland. Compassionate search is available in the U.S. and U.K., with more countries to come. Check out our Stay safe, stay inspired board for even more ideas.

Pinterest brings people the inspiration to create a life they love. Most of the time here in the U.S., that means helping nearly 90 million Americans plan their futures, whether that’s planning a wedding or turning a hobby into a small business. But there are times when it’s more than that. That’s why we’re working with the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2020 Census will determine federal funding for schools, transportation, housing and other essential community assets people need to thrive–the building blocks for an inspired life. We want to do our part to make sure people on Pinterest are fully counted. Introducing a civic participation policy As part of our community guidelines on misinformation and disinformation, we’re introducing a civic participation policy. This policy doesn’t allow false or misleading content on Pinterest that impedes an election’s integrity or an individual's or group's civic participation, including registering to vote, voting and being counted in a census. For instance, we’ll remove false or misleading content about who can participate in the census and what information is collected, and we’ll take down content that misleads people about where, when or how to vote. This also means that we prohibit any ads that include false or misleading content about elections and the 2020 Census. Combating misinformation and disinformation We’re working with the U.S. Census Bureau to verify and remove misinformation and disinformation from Pinterest. If we find a Pin or board that violates our policy, we’ll share it with the Census Bureau so that all the other platforms they’re working with can also take action on the content. Similarly, if the Bureau provides verified misinformation or disinformation to us, we’ll look for it on our platform and take anything we find down. We're also featuring the Census Bureau at our Pinterest 100 event today in Washington, DC, so folks can put a face to the agency and learn firsthand why this year's count is so important. Connecting people to authoritative resources We’re introducing a banner at the top of search results so that as people look for “2020 Census,” “#becounted” and other popular terms, they can easily access the U.S. 2020 Census website for authoritative information. The banner and list of terms was created with the Census Bureau. We expect it to evolve throughout the year as new terms become associated with or are used to spread misinformation or disinformation. Because so many teachers come to Pinterest to get inspiration for their lesson plans, classroom activities, tools and tips, the Census Bureau is bringing more content for teachers and their students onto Pinterest. For example, the Census Bureau Statistics in School’s Pinterest account is full of multilingual activities and resources to help teachers use real-life data when teaching statistics from pre-k to high school."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterests-new-ar-tech-lets-you-try-on-makeup-before-you-buy","date":"2019-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product","Technology"],"title":"Pinterest’s new AR tech lets you try on makeup before you buy","text":"Millions of people come to Pinterest every month to find beauty inspiration that fits their style and taste. Starting today, we’re taking what makes searching for beauty ideas on Pinterest great — like skin tone ranges, shoppable Pins and visual style recommendations — and enhancing it through augmented reality (AR) so Pinners can try on different lipstick shades for their skin tone, save for later shopping, or buy through the retailer’s site. We’re launching Try On, powered by Lens, live today in the mobile app. Simply open the Pinterest camera in search, click “Try on” to find different shades and swipe up to shop from brands like Estée Lauder, Sephora, bareMinerals, Neutrogena, and L’Oreal brands NYX Professional Makeup, YSL Beauté, Lancôme, and Urban Decay. A “try on” button will also appear on select products, as well as in search with related terms like “matte lipstick” or “red lips”. As we focus on building inclusive products, we've integrated Try On with our skin tone range feature, so Pinners can see similar lip shades on skin tones that match their own. And with Try On, you won’t find skin smoothing or image altering effects that make you look less like you (as you might see on some other AR technologies). We believe in celebrating you, and so our AR won’t be augmenting your reality, but rather helping you to make happy and real purchases for your life. As you try new lip shades, you can also snap a pic of your try and save it as a Pin to come back and shop later. Want to explore different looks with similar lip shades? Below Try On, browse “more like this” to see select Pins with related looks. Also, if you see someone wearing a lip color you like in a Pin, you’ll be able to try on a similar shade by clicking \"see similar looks\". We heard from Pinners who wanted a way to try on new looks for happier purchases they won’t want to return while mobile shopping. They also wanted ways to explore looks without the anxiety that may come with trying something new at a store or buying a new product online they haven’t tried. This is our latest feature to help Pinners explore their style and shop on Pinterest. According to a study by Cowen and Company, Pinterest outpaces social media companies when it comes to finding and shopping for products, with 48% of U.S. respondents citing Pinterest as the shopping platform of choice (three times more than the next). Try On for lipstick is currently rolling out to Pinners in the U.S. on iOS and Android, with more AR categories to come. Brands can learn more about integration by filling out this form.

All over the world, people are preparing for moments big and small, from buying a new car to planning weeknight meals. Hundreds of millions of them come to us with the expectation that they may stumble across a spark they weren’t even looking for. It's hard to feel inspired when you don't feel represented -- online or in your workplace -- and research shows that diverse teams make us more creative, diligent and hard working. When we are building products, a team of people with different backgrounds enables us to think through products, policies, and safety from all angles (for instance, how products could be abused or how they could unintentionally impact a community). In our 6th annual report, we’re hitting a new first: we’ve exceeded all three of our external hiring goals with respect to diversity: We wanted to increase hiring rates for full-time women engineers to 25% and surpassed it with a new high of 27%. We wanted to increase hiring rates to 8% underrepresented** minority engineers and exceeded it at 9%. We wanted to increase hiring rates for underrepresented minority employees across the company (business and product) to 12% and exceeded it at 14%. As one of the first companies to set annual public hiring goals in 2015, we want to hold ourselves accountable as we tackle this societal issue. Meaningful and sustainable progress takes time, and while we are far from where we’d like, we can see considerable change in our workforce since we started. Women are now 25% of engineers overall (up from 24% last year, and from 19% in 2015.) Underrepresented minorities make up 10% of employees (up from 9% last year, and 3% in 2015) and 7% of engineers (up from 6% last year, <1% in 2015). We can feel the impact of a more representative workforce, not just across our teams but also in product and policy decisions. Inclusivity is becoming ingrained into our culture. Here are some of the ways in which that came to life in the past year: In early 2019, we launched our skin tone ranges search feature across all platforms in the U.S. and followed up later in the year with a collection of emotional well-being activities that people can do right from our app if they’re feeling stressed, anxious or sad. Our user trends indicated a nearly 4000% increase in searches around gender transitions. Working with our employee communities, we released a public guide to support employee gender transition so that other companies could do the same. We regularly look for and limit content that could make people feel unwelcome or unsafe. We also work with outside organizations to ensure our policies are equitable and comprehensive. For instance, we limited the distribution of wedding venues that were former slave plantations. While we’ve made several changes we’re proud of, there are areas we are focused on improving and making more progress in. We recognize leadership diversity is our biggest area for opportunity and focus. We will also continue to focus on overall representation of underrepresented talent. So what are we going to commit to going forward? There are three lessons that stand above all else. Ensure business leader ownership of inclusion and diversity outcomes. Diversity at Pinterest is not an HR initiative, it’s something we all own. This year, the Leadership and Inclusion and Diversity teams partnered closely in co-creating a multi-year strategy to guide us through the next several years. We also designated business representatives to champion I&D in every business unit. Build a laser focus on specific efforts to diversify Pinterest leadership. Our executive team is partnering on leadership diversity through a variety of tactics. This starts by building relationships with internal and external talent proactively, including \"reverse mentorship\" relationships. We also require at least two underrepresented candidates at the final onsite stage for any leadership role with our diverse slate approach. In addition, we internally track specific leadership hiring aspirations and metrics, rather than simply an aggregated hiring goal. Don’t neglect retention. We learned that if we want to create a working environment where people can do their best work, we need to invest further in understanding what drives retention. We’ve expanded accountability metrics for inclusion and diversity to include retention and engagement parity, alongside hiring. These are reviewed with the executive team, as well as each business unit, on a quarterly basis at a minimum. Inclusion and diversity is not only a value; it’s foundational to making the best decisions and building the strongest teams over time, and we recognize we still have work to do. We are committed to building, developing and nurturing a balanced team for Pinterest, evolving our strategies as we learn and holding ourselves accountable to driving the changes we all want to see. In 2020, we will continue to infuse inclusion and diversity into Pinterest recognition, values, and expectations - and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable publicly with all of you. **Underrepresented minorities are defined as employees of Native American and Pacific Islander, Latinx, and Black descent. *Tech includes engineering, product design and product management organizations. Engineering includes full-time employees that report into the engineering organization excluding executive assistants. EEO-1 Pinterest's most recently filed EEO-1 Report, which represents employees as of December 2018, is available here. Please note that due to the way the U.S. government tracks EEO-1 data, this report reflects job groupings and categories that do not align with the way Pinterest groups our roles and employees internally. While we are making this report publicly available, we believe that the information presented in our Diversity Report is a more accurate reflection of the progress we've made toward diversity and work we're continuing to do."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/expanding-compassionate-search-to-nine-additional-countries","date":"2019-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","Product","Technology"],"title":"Expanding compassionate search to nine additional countries","text":"Today we’re bringing our collection of emotional well-being activities to Pinners in nine additional countries, including the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, Singapore, India, the Philippines, Hong Kong and New Zealand. First introduced in the U.S. last year, these are evidence-based well-being practices someone can do to try to improve their mood if they’re feeling stressed, anxious, sad or trying to manage difficult emotions. For example, if someone searches for “stress relief” they might choose the “redirect your energy” activity which suggests practices like journaling for perspective, drawing a nature scene or something abstract, or making a playlist. If they select “accept your emotions” they’ll be guided through steps to practice self-compassion. People will see a prompt to explore these activities if they search for things like “sad quotes,” “work anxiety” or other terms that indicate they might be feeling down. They can also be accessed any time by searching #pinterestwellbeing. This more compassionate search experience was created with the help of emotional health experts at Brainstorm, the Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, and with advice from Samaritans, Vibrant Emotional Health and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. While we’ve long worked with organizations to provide people in extreme distress with quick access to expert support, this experience tries to address a broader emotional spectrum of what Pinners may be looking for. It’s not meant to replace professional care, but may help someone looking for support. For people who may be experiencing thoughts of suicide or need someone to talk to immediately, we continue to provide direct access to suicide prevention lifelines, including Samaritans in the UK and Ireland, Crisis Services Canada in Canada, Aasra in India, and more. Our commitment to privacy These resources look different from the rest of Pinterest, and that’s because the experience is kept separate. People’s interactions with these activities are private and not connected to their account. This also means Pinterest won’t show recommendations or ads based on their use of these resources. Pinterest does not track who uses them, and all activity is stored anonymously using a third-party service. Creating a more positive internet More than 320 million people come to Pinterest every month to do something–decorate a room in their home, plan a trip or their wedding. But people also come to feel something. Quotes are the third most popular search term on Pinterest, as people are looking for ways to feel more inspired or motivated, or less alone or down. Because life isn’t always inspiring. According to the World Health Organization, one in four people will be affected by mental health issues in their lifetime, and more than 300 million people today suffer from depression. Nearly two-thirds of people with a known mental disorder never seek help from a health professional. We see this reflected online, too. As people look for ways to cope with their emotions, searches for anxiety quotes increased 8x year-over-year, and searches for how to support someone with depression have doubled. Sometimes, you need more than an inspirational quote. That’s why we’re going a step further to offer tools people can use on a regular basis to help manage their emotions, and we hope they leave Pinterest feeling a little bit better. This collection of emotional well-being activities is now available to everyone in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, Singapore, India, the Philippines, Hong Kong and New Zealand in our apps for iOS and Android (version 8.0). We will continue to improve the experience and work with more health experts to make these resources available to even more people around the world in the future.

More than 200 billion ideas have been saved to over 4 billion boards to-date on the platform, providing insights into emerging trends and early signals into consumer behavior and evolving tastes. Today, we’re starting to roll out Pinterest Trends, a new tool that will give a view of the top US search terms within the past 12 months, and a look into when top search terms peak so you can better understand how content performs on Pinterest. Pinterest Trends will help brands get deeper insights into planning behaviors on the platform, and allow them to allocate budgets to campaigns during various planning stages. It will also validate assumptions about emerging trends, refine search queries with the aid of auto-complete suggestions, and help advertisers find a list of keywords to include or avoid while planning media campaigns. Because people come to Pinterest to save ideas and plan for the future, we can understand unique and emerging tastes, preferences and interests that have powered our algorithm over the years, and are now available for brands to learn more from. Global media company, Tastemade, uses video analytics and audience insights to make informed programming decisions. For example, over the summer, they saw that watermelon content was outperforming across platforms, so they doubled down and created a dedicated Board, which led to a viral watermelon-focused Pin campaign. Brands like Albertsons, which tapped into Pinterest insights to better understand holiday food and beverage trends, developed a campaign aimed at driving in-store sales for their private label brands including pumpkin alcohol drinks (+154%), Friendsgiving party ideas (+475%), holiday grazing tables (+500%) and Christmas desserts (+229%). \"Albertsons shoppers want to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to new and exciting trends. We believe Pinterest is the perfect platform to inspire shoppers with a new take on Holiday classics as they plan for the season. Using Pinterest Trends online and in-store enables Own Brands to be top of mind in a truly innovative way.\" -Chad Coester, SVP of Own Brands Today we also announced the Pinterest 100, our annual report that reveals the top emerging trends to try in the year ahead. This extensive report also offers businesses a sneak peek at what research shows people around the world will want in the coming year. To test out or confirm the ideas and topics that might be trending, you'll be able to try the new Pinterest Trends to see inside search behaviors on Pinterest and apply it to brand and campaign decisions, or get a feel for the latest on Pinterest. Pinterest Trends will be available over the coming weeks on desktop in the US."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/pinterestshop","date":"2019-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Ads","News","Pinterest for Business","Beauty","Home","Lifestyle","Style"],"title":"Celebrating small businesses on Pinterest","text":"To celebrate small businesses this holiday season, we’re launching the Pinterest Shop, your place to discover small businesses and shop their unique products.

A lot of technology today prioritizes behavioral outcomes (“Does it get clicks? Let’s do more of it.”). We believe it’s important to prioritize emotional outcomes. Everything we do is in service of helping people feel more inspired. So when we noticed people in especially low moments were coming to Pinterest to try to feel a little better, we wanted to do more to meet them in whatever mindset they’re in. That’s why earlier this year we launched a more compassionate search experience with activities people can do to improve their mood. We developed it with emotional health experts at Brainstorm, the Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, and with guidance from Vibrant Emotional Health and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. These experts continue to help us better understand different emotional states, including the unique needs of people who search for self-harm. If we can help even one person feel more optimistic, we know that’s time well spent. Introducing coping exercises to compassionate search Today we are expanding our compassionate search experience to better support people who are feeling sadness, pain or other emotions related to the urge to self-harm. Now, if someone searches for a term related to self-injury, they’ll find ten new coping exercises that can help them work through difficult emotions and feelings. Each exercise is guided with steps people can take to manage their feelings, such as ways to redirect energy, release tension or create a calm environment. For example, let’s say you typed in “self hate” and chose the “redirect your energy” activity. It would suggest starting a journal and rereading it a few days later to get some perspective on your thoughts. Or, if writing isn’t your thing, you could try drawing a nature scene or making a playlist. Each activity is evidence-based and comes out of our work with emotional health experts. They aren’t meant to replace professional care, but are carefully designed to help people improve their outlook. People can also access the collection at any time by searching for #pinterestwellbeing in our app. For people who may be experiencing thoughts of suicide, we continue to provide access to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline directly from our search results, from the well-being activities page and on boards with content that could signal someone is in emotional distress. As I know myself, emotional wellness is a personal journey. That’s why Pinterest does not track who uses these exercises. People’s interactions with these activities are stored anonymously using a third-party service so that they won’t be shown related recommendations or ads. We were also thoughtful about the design of the experience, making sure it felt separate from Pinterest itself. We used gentler colors to create a sense of harmony and calmness, and specially designed the UI to keep people’s focus on the resources. We also used a fullscreen approach that uses optimized typography to make the activities easy to read and follow. Along with developing these resources, we’ve dramatically improved our ability to catch and remove content related to self-harm. Our machine learning technologies are increasingly identifying and hiding this content before anyone sees it. As a result, reports of this content from Pinners decreased by 88 percent over the last year. A more positive internet I hear from a lot of Pinners that they come to Pinterest to do something–cook a recipe, plan a vacation. But people also come to feel something. Quotes are the third most popular search term on all of Pinterest as people look for words to help them feel more inspired (“inspirational quotes” is #22), comforted (“life quotes” is #34) and motivated (“motivational quotes” is #38). We have a responsibility to recognize how and why people use our service and build experiences that help them feel more positive when they leave. Because sometimes you need more than an inspirational quote. Through our work with mental health experts, we’ve learned a lot about trying to meet our Pinners in whatever emotional state they’re in. The reality is that more Americans are reporting symptoms of depression. Seven in ten teens see depression and anxiety as major problems among their peers. And when it comes to self-harm, a recent study showed that nearly 18 percent of U.S. teens reported harming themselves at least once during the previous year. Those rates are even higher among teenage girls, affecting about one in four in some parts of America. For some of the most painful emotional experiences–urges to self-injure or thoughts of suicide–most tech platforms are good at connecting people to crisis hotlines. But there’s a gap between urges to self-injure and thoughts of suicide. Experts confirm that these are different emotional states, and they require different solutions–most people who injure themselves are often not suicidal in the moment, and instead are looking for a way to cope with their emotions. The exercises we created bridge that gap–offering new ways for someone to reduce their stress levels in the moment, and giving them tools they can use on a regular basis to cope with their emotions. And if they ever need access to crisis prevention support, it’s readily available from our app. These new activities are available to Pinners in the U.S. today in our apps for iOS and Android (version 7.37 and above). We are working to bring the experience to more Pinners in more places soon.

We want the people we hire to reflect the world we serve and understand those who are different from them. Building an inclusive work environment is important to us, which is why we signed the landmark ”friend of the court” Amicus Brief in July to support protections for LGBTQ employees. We’ve been offering a custom gender field option for new users since in 2015, and are proud to have scored 100% on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Making Pinterest’s employee culture safe and supportive for people who are transitioning is an important part of living our values. We are deeply committed to creating and sustaining a work environment where everyone—regardless of sex, gender or gender identity—feels valued. We approach this commitment through employee resource groups, insurance medical coverage policies that are fully WPATH (World Professional Association of Transgender Health) compliant, paid family leave, and now, a clear process to support employees who are transitioning. To help other workplaces looking to support their trans employees, we’re making our gender transition guide available to the public. Designed by and for Pinterest employees, we’ve put together a roadmap for transitioning employees to follow with additional resources for managers, HR departments, teams and allies who want to support their colleagues with awareness, sensitivity and kindness. A Pinterest employee shared about their experience working at Pinterest during their transition and later working with the Inclusion & Diversity team to develop the guide: “There was no employee transition guide or defined path for transitioning at Pinterest when I told my manager I had started testosterone and would soon start using male pronouns. Yet, every single person I came out to was either cool about it or enthusiastically supportive. Feedback from everyone really amounted to, \"I'm happy for you and I support you. Go for it!\" From then on, the issues I encountered were solely logistic and not even related to insurance or red tape nightmarish things you might expect (thank you, People Ops!). For instance, my old legal name was already auto-saved in everyone's contacts and there wasn't a way to override it. That name also showed up on a desk move list that was sent to a whole lot of people. These are the kinds of things that, well, happen in the world outside of work too. Some of these issues will persist, but I was happy to work with the Inclusion & Diversity team on developing the Employee Transition Guide and see how far we've come as a company in supporting our current and future employees going through or considering a transition. The supportive culture was there. Now, we have something tangible that can evolve with our needs.” We’re honored that people who are thinking about their gender identity and expression turn to Pinterest for inspiration. As we build a product focused on exploring interests and planning for the future, we’ll continue making decisions and products that are inclusive for everyone who creates and uses Pinterest around the world."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/holiday-shopping-report","date":"2019-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Beauty","Celebrations","Food","Home","Lifestyle","Seasons","Style"],"title":"The Pinterest Holiday Shopping Report: Gift inspiration for everyone on your list","text":"Pinners eagerly await the holiday season, with searches starting as early as June each year.

But as your interests and plans change, your experience on Pinterest should evolve with you, too. In fact, one of our top Pinner requests is for more control over what you see in your home feed, and better ways to signal what you like and don’t like over time. Today, we’re making it easier than ever to control the recommendations you see in your home feed with a new home feed tuner and Pin-level controls. Now you can easily see the boards, topics, followed accounts and recent history that contribute to your recommendations and make tweaks so your feed stays relevant and inspiring. Maybe you’ve been searching for turkey recipes for Thanksgiving, but don’t want to see recommendations for it. Or you might want to turn off recommendations for your wedding or baby boards, or a home remodel board once the project is complete. We’ll always work to show you great recommendations, but taste is personal and we want you to have a bigger say in defining and refining your own tastes on Pinterest. Home feed tuner Starting today, you’ll have one easy, comprehensive view of what contributes to the recommendations you see in your home feed. From here, you can toggle each input on or off to decide whether it should continue to inform what you see on your home feed. Flip on if you want to see more ideas, flip off if you’d rather not, whether because the content is sensitive or irrelevant. With this update, you’ll also have the option to receive recommendations for your secret boards, which were previously excluded from your recommendations. Don’t worry - secret boards will still remain hidden from your profile (as noted by the ‘lock’ icon). However, you now have the option to turn on recommendations if you want to see more about those topics — like a surprise birthday party or board of gift ideas — in your feed. To get to the home feed tuner: On desktop, click the “...” button and select “Tune your home feed” or visit https://pinterest.com/homefeed/edit(opens in a new window) On Android, visit the settings icon on your profile page, then select ‘Home Feed’. On iOS, go to your profile settings, then Account Settings, and select Home Feed. New Pin-level controls If you ever see a Pin in your feed and wonder how it got there - you’re in luck. Now you can tap on the “...” under any Pin to see why you are seeing the Pin and to give feedback if you don’t like it. You can also share feedback on why you’ve hidden a Pin so we can learn not to show you similar ones in the future. Quote from Omar Seyal, Head of Pinner Products “We built these features in direct response to Pinner needs and to give people a way to turn recommendations on or off, while more easily controlling content that might be irrelevant or sensitive. We approached this in the same way our engineers build recommendations on the backend, by handing a control panel over to the Pinner so she can tune her home feed and have the most relevant and inspirational experience possible.” We hope these new controls help your home feed reflect even more of who you are and inspire where you’re going. The new features are available globally and across platforms.

We believe a healthy life is an inspired life, and today we have an update on our efforts to combat health misinformation. We’re introducing a new experience for vaccine-related searches on Pinterest. Now, when you search for “measles,” “vaccine safety” and other related health terms, you can explore reliable results about immunizations from leading public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the WHO-established Vaccine Safety Net (VSN), a global network of websites providing reliable vaccine safety information in various languages. Last year, we made the decision to stop showing results for searches related to vaccines as a way to prevent people from encountering harmful health misinformation. This new search experience only shows content from leading public health institutions—you won’t see any recommendations or comments on Pins in these results. We also won’t show ads. We’re taking this approach because we believe that showing vaccine misinformation alongside resources from public health experts isn't responsible. As we continue to tackle health misinformation, we remove it and the accounts that spread it from our service. But we also want to bring expert content onto Pinterest. We know we aren’t medical experts, which is why we’re working with professionals to inspire Pinners with reliable information about health. With these authoritative Pins now in our system, they can also be discovered in home feed, related Pins and from the profiles of the WHO, VSN, CDC and AAP. Health misinformation is contagious Hesitancy around vaccines is one of this year’s top global health threats, according to the WHO. The WHO(opens in a new window) recently announced that the UK, Albania, Czechia and Greece have lost their “measles-free” status, and the CDC confirmed that the U.S. is experiencing the greatest number of measles cases reported since 1992 and since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000. Since 2017 it’s been against our community guidelines to promote anti-vaccination advice and other health misinformation, and we’ve never allowed it to be advertised. We’ve long used guidance from these health institutions to inform our policy and how we enforce it, but we wanted to do more. Here’s why. Health misinformation has the potential to impact public health, regardless of what service it’s found on. Allowing this content to spread through Pinterest’s search results is not in line with enforcing our community guidelines. That’s why we’re limiting search results to internationally recognized health organizations. What we and others have observed is an enthusiasm gap between those creating and disseminating harmful health misinformation and those creating resources rooted in settled science. Generally, there’s more accessible and visually compelling health misinformation than science-based journal articles on the virtues of vaccinations. In addition, we’ve found that some purveyors of health misinformation have a financial incentive. For instance, some sell products and potions, and others use spammer tactics and clickbait to drive traffic to their own sites where they monetize. On top of that, experts have shown there’s a data void when it comes to reliable information about vaccines––there’s a greater distribution of vaccine misinformation than information. In short, anti-vaccine content is contagious. As another way to address that gap, we’re developing creative resources that health organizations can easily use to create visually compelling Pins for content that’s primarily text-based. For example, below is a Pin the AAP created with the help of our creative team. The work continues We’re starting with vaccinations because the WHO determined that vaccine hesitancy is a significant threat to everyone. We’ll need to keep evolving our list of terms for which we block medical misinformation and provide expert advice as people try to get around our safeguards. We’ll also continue to remove this content and accounts that spread it from our service. This new search experience is now available globally in English on the web and in our mobile apps for iPhone and Android. We look forward to continuing our work with health experts to expand authoritative results on other searches and in more languages. Ultimately, we want to bring authoritative results to more Pinners in more places, because there’s nothing inspiring about harmful health misinformation. - Ifeoma Ozoma, Public Policy and Social Impact Manager"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/back-to-life-the-new-new-year-on-pinterest","date":"2019-07-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Lifestyle","Seasons","Trends"],"title":"“Back to Life”: The new New Year on Pinterest","text":"Every year on Pinterest, searches for organization, routine, positivity, and goal setting spike twice— once during the new year as resolutions are in full swing, and again right before fall as people get inspired after an energizing summer.

Because people come to Pinterest to shop and get style inspiration, we’ve been making updates to not only make Pinterest more shoppable, but to bring you more of that picked-just-for-you feeling. Today we’re rolling out new ways to dive into your favorite brands from personalized ideas at the top of home feed and browsable catalogs alongside Pins. In addition to personalized shopping hubs at the top of your home feed, an updated shopping section is rolling out below Pins, making it easy to browse into the catalogs of brands of all sizes like Target, Birdies Slippers, Joybird, The Tie Bar, and Parachute. For retailers, these features provide another way to reach Pinners while they’re shopping on Pinterest and looking to discover products they’ll love. A new study from Neustar released today looks at the effectiveness of shopping ads, and participating retail brands saw a 2x higher return on ad spend on Pinterest than social media and a 1.3x higher return than on paid search. More can be found on our Business Blog. \"Pinterest has been an important brand awareness and acquisition tool for our brand. As home is one of the most popular categories on Pinterest, and users regularly look to the platform to find inspiration for their interiors, Pinterest has provided us with a natural destination to connect with our growing community.

These guided activities were created with the help of emotional health experts at Brainstorm, the Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, and with advice from Vibrant Emotional Health and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Each practice offers people an interactive way to try to improve their mood––from tools to help someone relax to self-compassion exercises. People will see a prompt to explore these resources when they search for things like “stress quotes,” “work anxiety” or other terms that indicate they might be feeling down. The experience is not meant to replace professional care, but it may help someone if they need support. As always, if someone is searching for something self-harm related, we continue to direct them to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which they can get to in just two taps. These resources look different from the rest of Pinterest, and that’s because the experience is kept separate. People’s interactions with these activities are private and not connected to their account. This means we won’t show recommendations or ads based on their use of these resources. Pinterest also does not track who uses them. All activity is stored anonymously using a third-party service. This collection of emotional well-being activities will be available to everyone in the U.S. over the coming weeks in our app for iOS and Android (version 7.25). We hope to bring the experience to all Pinners in the future. Why we’re doing this People come to Pinterest to discover ideas, get inspired and focus on themselves, their interests, their futures. One of the main ways people find inspiration is through Search, from summer activities to try to creative ways to express yourself. But we know that life isn’t always so inspiring, and things on the internet aren’t either. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 50% of Americans will be diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder at some point in their lifetime. Real-life feelings and experiences carry over to our lives online. For instance, in the last year there have been millions of searches in the U.S. related to emotional health on Pinterest. Over the years we’ve worked with experts to make it easy for people in distress to access supportive resources. Together we wanted to create a more compassionate, actionable experience that tries to address a broader emotional spectrum of what Pinners may be looking for. More to come This experience is one of the new things we’re trying in our ongoing efforts to make Pinterest an inspiring and welcoming place for everyone. Our goal is to meet people where they are and connect them with tools they can take with them offline and do in their real lives at any time. We will continue to improve the experience, work with more health experts and make these resources available to even more people around the world. –Annie Ta, Pinner Product Manager"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/-video-on-pinterest","date":"2019-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product"],"title":"More ways to discover inspiring video on Pinterest","text":"People come to Pinterest ready to try something new, which makes it an ideal platform for businesses to feature helpful products and services, how-to videos and tutorials, and to tell an interesting brand story.

In fact, searches on lesson plans are trending up (59%1) across the board on Pinterest, for Spanish, English, art, library, toddler curriculums, or daycare. Teachers have been part of the Pinterest community since the very beginning, and in addition to lesson plans, they often look for classroom activities and decoration ideas. Pinterest is a central place for teachers to find creative ideas quickly and easily.

This newly launched specialty of ‘Shopping’ partners includes: Platform partners like WooCommerce and Square Online Store who allow businesses to set up e-commerce sites and experiences Feed management providers like Feedonomics, Productsup, and GoDataFeed who can manage and optimize product inventory feeds for businesses bringing their product catalogs to Pinterest Shoppable experience platforms like Shoppable, MikMak, Jebbit, Drizly, and Basketful who connect products within a Pin with the retailers that can fulfill orders and make it easier to shop Tag management providers including PixelYourSite and Tealium who can track closed-loop measurement of online shopping conversions and sales In recent years we've introduced new shopping features on Pinterest like product Pins, catalogs to bring in product feeds, personalized shopping recommendations and Shop the Look. According to a Gfk, US Path to Purchase Study in 2018, 57 percent of weekly Pinners said they used Pinterest in-store while shopping. We want people to be able to shop for any item they see on Pinterest. When we first introduced the Marketing Developer Partners program in 2015, we had just launched our ads products. Since then the needs of the businesses who use Pinterest every day have evolved from ads to even more diverse business areas. And now with Shopping added to the specialties in our program, we’re officially renaming our “Marketing Partners” program to simply the “Pinterest Partner” program. This group of curated solution providers includes Advertising, Content Marketing, Audiences, Measurement, Creative, and Shopping. With these partners, we can truly help businesses of all sizes reach their goals. Additionally, to make it easier for all the businesses on Pinterest to see and understand their organic and paid performance on Pinterest we are testing a new Reporting API. The Reporting API will give businesses insight into how their organic content on Pinterest engages their audience and which ads are the most relevant. Whether you use a business intelligence or analytics platform or have your own in-house dashboards, the Reporting API will make it easier than ever to optimize for Pinterest. Lastly, our core ads program keeps growing, with the addition of two new international partners to our existing advertising specialties.

Pinners are looking for inspiration, and brands help make that inspiration a reality. In the past year, we’ve been bringing together the worlds of visual search and shopping to make it easy to shop for anything you see on Pinterest, and for brands to reach people on Pinterest while they’re actively looking for inspiration. Today we’re announcing our latest features including more spaces to shop with personalized recommendations for style and home decor boards, browsable sections of in-stock products from a specific brand, and shopping search. And, we’re launching Catalogs and Shopping Ads updates so brands can plug their products into new shopping spaces and have them seen by millions of people. (view all images and GIF demos here). Shop a brand (pictured above): A new dedicated section from retailers is starting to roll out beneath Product Pins. You’ll soon be able to dive into a brand’s catalog by clicking “more from [brand]”. Personalized shopping recommendations: Alongside style, home, beauty and DIY boards, you’ll see in-stock ideas related to what you’ve been saving, to match your style. Just click “more ideas” then the shopping tag to start shopping ideas picked for you. Tap + to quickly add the Pin to your board, or click the Pin to go straight to checkout on the retailer’s site. Catalogs: Brands can now upload their full catalog to Pinterest and easily turn their products into dynamic Product Pins, which means more shoppable Pins across Pinterest. A new dashboard allows businesses to organize their feed so their products can be discovered and purchased by Pinners. Shopping Ads: We're making Shopping Ads available to all businesses through our self-serve tool Ads Manager. Once products are on Pinterest, brands can easily promote items from their existing product feed with Shopping Ads. Shopping search: With more in-stock Product Pins, there are more products to search. Just search for a product like “midi skirt”, “men’s watches” or “outdoor furniture” and shopping results appear on the top of home feed. To start shopping, click “see more”. These updates help retailers get in front of customers who are looking for related products, and Pinners to see items that match their unique style and taste. Personalized shopping recommendations From Pin to purchase Get inspiration from designer Emily Henderson and shop her top picks for the home. Emily shared, \"It’s honestly hard to remember what it was like to design before Pinterest. I get inspired, discover new products, shop and organize almost every project I (and my team) work on. It’s also so helpful to see what pops up in the ‘More Like This’ section of any given Pin. So easy to go down the rabbit hole into ideas that are related to what I’m on the hunt for. Another feature that I really love is when I see a stunning inspirational Pin and can use the lens to find a product in it I desperately want to purchase. My adrenaline goes through the actual roof. Click, purchase and love forever.\" Happy spring shopping! For us, it’s not just about adding one or two shopping features—shopping is everywhere on Pinterest. You can search right from home feed for in-stock products, or visually search an object in a Pin to learn where to buy it, scroll beneath any style or home Pin to see Related Products, or discover new styles through personalized recommendations.

Even if these are small everyday changes, it’s inspiring to see people work together to make a difference.” -Swasti Sarna, Insights at Pinterest Below is a peek at how Pinners around the world are feeling inspired to take action and make an impact, from sustainable shopping and travel to using less waste at home and the office.

Women all over the world use Pinterest as a visual discovery engine to get beauty inspiration, from an everyday look to a special occasion. In fact, women on Pinterest are 2.4x more likely to experiment with different makeup, compared to women on other platforms. In April we began testing an inclusive search feature on the web to narrow beauty results by skin tone range. Today we’re announcing skin tone ranges is launching more broadly (across millions of searches) and coming to mobile, so you can discover personalized makeup and hair ideas on the go, whether you’re out shopping for new products, trying new tutorials at your bathroom mirror, or pulling up some inspiration at your salon. Over the coming weeks, as you search for makeup and hair ideas on iOS, select a palette to narrow your search from the drop down in the upper left corner. Searches for terms like “beauty tips”, “eyeshadow”, and trends like “glossy makeup” (searches +89%), stand-out lip colors (searches +467%), or “going gray” (+879%), will now result in more personalized videos and Pins. Each palette represents a range of skin tones, with more to come. The more you search, the more personalized your home feed and recommendations will become. Last year, nearly 60% of the top 100 search terms for skin-related searches involved a tone, such as dark skin, pale skin, and olive skin, which showed us women of all skin types wanted a way to customize their searches. This feature is a result of our technical and Inclusion & Diversity teams working closely together. As we recently shared in our annual diversity report, we’re committed to growing an employee base that understands and reflects the world we want to serve. Pinners shouldn’t have to do extra work like add keywords to find personally relevant ideas. And so the teams got together, listened to Pinner feedback, and worked on improving our machine learning technologies for more diverse results, which continues to evolve. Increasing engagement with beauty Pins is just a start in making all results more representative of a range of looks and styles. We also continue to listen to Pinner feedback. We hear from Pinners like: Priyanka who use Pinterest to find traditional Indian beauty, fashion and style ideas. Alejandra Ramos who says, “As a Latina woman of color, I especially love the way the new feature allows me to zoom in on the beauty ideas, products, and looks that actually feel relevant and accessible to me.” Vic Styles who says, \"Pinterest is my go-to for finding on trend beauty ideas. I actually prefer discovering beauty ideas on Pinterest than on traditional search engines.\" (video) We talk about these Pinner needs and feedback constantly and hold ourselves accountable to not only build an inclusive company that is welcoming of everyone, but an inclusive product that is useful to all. Keep an eye out for iOS update for your app in the coming weeks, followed by Android."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/building-a-more-diverse-pinterest-2018","date":"2018-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","Product","@8en"],"title":"Building a more diverse Pinterest: 2018 Inclusion & Diversity Report","text":"We aspire to build a product that the entire world can use. No matter where you live or what your background is, we want you to be able to discover the inspiration you need for your life. Building a diverse team is critical to achieving this aspiration. We want our employee base to understand and reflect the world we want to serve. We create better products whenever we bring together different talents and perspectives into a room. We’ve seen this play out at Pinterest. One example is a feature we piloted last year to give people a more inclusive way to discover beauty ideas. We had heard from Pinners of color who were frustrated that they had to work so hard to find the most personally relevant ideas to them. This was a problem we needed to address. A cross-functional group came together from across the company, including members of our engineering, inclusion and diversity, and product teams. We reached out to Pinners and looked at ways to improve our machine learning technology and content. The result was a new feature allowing people to customize their beauty search results by skin tone. We’re continuing to make improvements to this product and will be launching it on mobile in the coming weeks. Although we know there is a lot more work to do, this was one important step in serving all of our Pinners. Another was making Pinterest more accessible for people who are visually impaired. Diversity makes our product and our company better. This is something we have believed since we got started in 2010. But we know that belief doesn’t always translate into practice and action. In fact, once we started scaling quickly, we began to look like every other technology company. So in 2015, we did something new and set annual public hiring goals. Just as we had set goals for every other aspect of our business, we chose to do the same thing for attracting and growing talent from diverse backgrounds. We made these goals public to help hold ourselves accountable, and to help us get input and ideas from others in the industry. In 2018, we achieved two of our three hiring goals. Specifically: Our goal was to increase hiring rates for people from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds in non-engineering roles to 12%. We exceeded that goal and reached 14%. Our goal was to increase hiring rates for engineers from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds to 8%. We reached 7%, which is better than last year but still short. Our goal was to increase the hiring rates for full-time women engineers to 25%. We hit that goal and reached 25%. In addition, representation of women increased in the company overall and in tech. Women now make up 47% of the company (up from 45% last year) and 30% of the people working in tech are women (up from 29% last year). We know there is a ton more work to do. Here are some of the things we’ve learned along the way that we plan to apply in 2019:. Build relationships with underrepresented talent all the time. This year we focused on diversifying where we sourced candidates and providing unconscious bias training to our interviewers and managers. However, we were inconsistent about building long-term relationships with talent. Relationships can’t be turned on and off. Building them requires continuous effort, even when there aren’t open positions. We created explicit goals for managers to spend time meeting new talent. And not only people who are in the industry today, but also with people who are likely to enter our industry in the future. Apprenticeship programs work. We launched this program three years ago to attract talent from non-traditional tech backgrounds like coding boot camp graduates and self-taught coders. We’ve converted 93% of participants into full-time engineers. Those who didn’t went on to get software engineering jobs at other companies. Invest in employee communities. From 2016-2018, we’ve grown the number of employee resource groups from 1 to 8. They play an essential role in helping develop leaders, addressing concerns of employees and users, and fostering belonging. We are proud that an internal survey reports that 85% of our employees tell us they feel like they belong at Pinterest, our highest score to date. Support employees’ whole lives. We want to make Pinterest a place where everyone feels welcomed, valued and respected. That means supporting our employees both inside and outside the office. We are proud to offer a number of benefits to support our employees, from offering 4 months of leave for new moms and dads plus an additional four weeks for a gradual return to work (part-time at full-time pay), to fertility benefits, to access to mental health benefits services. We still have a long way to go. That’s why we continue to make this work a top priority for Pinterest. We know it’s critical to building a great product and a strong company. Here’s what we learned in 2016 and 2017. We look forward to sharing more of the lessons we learn in the future."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/whats-hap-pin-in-newsletter-january-19","date":"2018-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Celebrations","Home","Lifestyle","Parenting","Seasons","Trends","@SwastiSarna"],"title":"What's Hap-Pin-in': January 2019","text":"The New Year is here and we've got the scoop on all the things to keep you inspired in 2019.

That’s our vision for shopping with Pinterest. People have always used Pinterest for shopping inspiration. Because everything’s visual, it’s easy to spot things that match your unique tastes—a new style to wear, or a new way to spruce up your home—even when you don’t have the words to describe what you’re searching for. Once you find something you’d like to buy, simply click through to the retailer’s website to make your purchase. With Shop the Look, you can even find where to buy individual items within a Pin. Or you can use the Lens camera to visually search for items you see out in the world. And now we’re introducing even more ways to shop with Pinterest. Introducing new Product Pins and shopping recommendations Today we’re making hundreds of millions of Pins shoppable with up-to-date pricing and stock information, with links that go directly to the checkout page on the retailer’s site where you can buy in a few clicks. Just look for the new shopping tag icon, and you'll know it's in stock. And, a new shopping recommendations section can now be found beneath Style and Home Pins so you can browse similar items across multiple brands. With Products Pins more discoverable in home feed and search results, Pinterest as a whole has become markedly more shoppable for your unique needs. Now that Product Pins are integrated throughout Pinterest and in new shopping sections, they’ll be replacing the older Buyable Pin format. In the past quarter since we started testing these shopping features, clicks on products to retail sites have increased by 40%. Now on women’s fashion and home decor Pins, you can browse more in-stock items inspired by the original Pin in the new shopping recommendations section. Clicking for more in the section will lead you to a shoppable feed full of similar styles, all in stock. We’re also introducing a new shopping shortcut so you can shop right from your feed, rolling out on iOS in the U.S. today and soon on the Android app. Just hold down on any Home or Style Pin and click the shopping tag to immediately dive into a shopping feed with in-stock and related products for that Pin, from a variety of brands. Pinterest is like your personal stylist. We can give you recommendations for products to buy based on your unique taste and what’s trending, and show you a range of visual ideas. New Product Pins are rolling out globally across mobile apps and Pinterest.com.

The office will open on October 1 and will be run by newly hired Country Manager, Erin Elofson. Erin most recently led sales teams at Facebook Canada and previously spent 11 years at Microsoft Canada acting as the global lead for the company’s partnership with BMO Financial Group. “I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to lead Pinterest Canada,” said Erin Elofson, Country Manager, Pinterest. “Pinterest is already deeply embedded in our culture and Canadians love Pinterest because they want to discover and try new things. They are relentlessly seeking inspiration to enhance their own lives. Canadian businesses have the opportunity to offer the right products and services to Pinners to help them realize those aspirations and I'm looking forward to working with these businesses.” More than 250 million people use Pinterest each month to discover and do what they love, and people save 4.5 million ideas on Pinterest in Canada each day. “We have a strong, passionate user base in Canada and there is a great opportunity for businesses to connect with these people that are actively considering what to do or buy next,” said Jon Kaplan, Global Head of Partnerships at Pinterest. “With the addition of a proven industry expert in Erin who will lead our growing new office, we are committed to the Canadian market and the many businesses we look forward to working with.” More than 1.5 million businesses worldwide use Pinterest to connect with people who come to the platform with a purpose, making them open to ideas. As a result, businesses can turn them into customers and drive growth for their company. There are thousands of active advertisers in Canada, and this number has increased 50% since the beginning of the year. Advertisers include Nestlé Canada, Nature’s Path and startups like Inkbox, a semi-permanent tattoo company. International growth is a priority for us with more than 80% of signups coming from outside the U.S. We continue to focus on a local, personalized experience which includes the ads program.

Each day, people come to Pinterest looking for inspirational ideas to try, and many of those ideas are rooted in Hispanic and Latin American traditions. Take for example, Lala Lopez, who used Pinterest to inspire her work as a photographer: \"I created a series of self-portraits inspired by Frida Kahlo that explored her life, work and spirituality. I used secret boards to get the idea going and found ideas on how to set up my shots. I used them to get down to the nitty gritty about Kahlo’s life. I wondered what influences were a part of her everyday life, so I searched ‘Frida Kahlo fashion,’ ‘Frida Kahlo style,’ ‘Mexican folk art’ and things like ‘flowers in hair.’ At the same time, I wanted the project to represent me. I wanted to celebrate my big curly hair, brown skin and creativity. I wanted that to really shine through, rather than trying to make myself look like Frida Kahlo.\" Lala is not alone—hundreds of millions of Pinners around the world come to Pinterest looking for ideas for how to decorate their home, what to wear to work, what to cook for their family, and more. This global exchange of ideas is what makes our Pinner community so special. Our Pinners constantly remind us of how much more alike we are than different and that, together, we are better. For all of Hispanic Heritage Month—September 15th to October 15th—whenever you search Pinterest for “Hispanic Heritage Month” (or related search terms like “Hispanic culture” or “Latina”), a selection of boards celebrating Hispanic and Latin American heritage will appear in your results. You’ll find boards that include luminaries like Dr. France A. Córdova (Director of the National Science Foundation and former NASA Chief Scientist), Isabel Allende (world-renowned author and winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom) and Oscar Arias Sánchez (Nobel Peace Prize winner). The Hispanic Heritage Month boards you’ll find come from the larger Pinner community as well as Todos Pincluidos, Pinterest’s own community of Hispanic and Latin American employees and allies. Our boards also include some of our favorite recipes, people we look up to and Hispanic and Latin American influencers and creators who inspire us to try new things on Pinterest. We hope you find these boards inspiring, and discover something new and wonderful to try in your own life. — Christine Flores, General Counsel, currently pinning to Todos Pincluidos."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/helping-a-quarter-billion-people-find-inspiration","date":"2018-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","@sharp"],"title":"Helping a quarter billion people find inspiration","text":"As of today, there are now more than 250 million people who use Pinterest each month. That’s a lot of people (more than the population of Brazil!). But more than the size of the number, what’s truly exciting is how all those people are using Pinterest. At a time when the internet can feel increasingly negative and politicized, we think it's remarkable that a quarter of a billion people are choosing to spend their time on Pinterest, a place that helps them feel positive and optimistic about the future. A growing global community Over half of the people on Pinterest—and 80% of new signups—are from outside the United States. But no matter where you’re from, Pinterest gives you the inspiration you need to create a life you love. We hear it again and again. Pinners across the globe describe Pinterest as their own positive corner of the internet. It’s where they go to learn about their personal tastes, and get the confidence to try new things. According to a Nielsen study, 98% of Pinners go out and try ideas they find on Pinterest—way more than the 71% social media platform average. Other apps are about connecting with friends and inviting more people to join. Pinterest is your place to reconnect with yourself. Like Pablo in Buenos Aires, who goes to Pinterest for inspiration—for shoes, for his latest design projects, for outfitting his new apartment with his girlfriend. Or Wasana in Bangkok, who tried so many of the recipes she found on Pinterest, she built up the confidence to start teaching her own cooking classes. Or Mylène in Lyon, who’s been trying embroidered wall art, tattoos and new recipes. “Pinterest helps me feel more creative,” Mylène told us. “It's the best moment of the day, when I get home and can sit on my couch and scroll through Pinterest. I don't have to think of work or things I have to do, like groceries or the dishes. I’ll find Pins that make me think 'Why don't I try that?'\" 175+ billion ideas and counting There are now more than 175 billion Pins to explore on Pinterest—up 75% since early last year. People have been saving all kinds of different ideas here, like products they love (+115%), style ideas (+38%), art (+50%) and DIY projects to try (+35%). Which means there are now more ideas than ever for other people to discover and get inspired by. When we first started building Pinterest eight years ago, we certainly hoped people would use it to get more creative with their daily lives. But we never imagined Pinterest would one day be one of the biggest internet platforms in history. But more important than this big milestone number are the people behind it. Our Pinners are what matter most. Which is why we regularly travel around the world to meet the people who use Pinterest. This week, my co-founder Ben and I are heading to Kansas City and Des Moines to meet with folks and hear some of those stories in person. It’s one of my favorite things we do.

Having a conversation about a specific Pin is also more seamless than before. You can weigh in with a quick “like” or comment, @-mention a collaborator or reply to start a new thread.

It’s what drives us to make Pinterest a positive and inclusive app, built just for you. There’s no better time to celebrate your true self than Pride Month. At Pinterest, Pride is one of our most favorite times of the year. It's our chance to raise our rainbow flag high in celebration of all our LGBTQ+ Pinners and Pinployees. We also get to cut loose with a number of colorful features within the product itself, lovingly brought to you by Pinwheels, the Pinterest LGBTQ+ employee and allies group. A rainbow of ideas Pinterest is full of ideas for how to bring Pride to life, from parade-wear ideas to inspirational quotes to rainbow recipes (check out our top trending Pride Pins). And now when you search “Pride,” even the usually grey suggested searches light up in all the colors of the rainbow: You’ll also find curated collections of Pins showcasing the ideas other people are saving with the hashtag #pridemonth, along with photos of the Pride Pins people are trying this year. Discover collections of Pins about LGBTQ+ history, must-watch films, drag makeup tutorials and more. We’ll be changing the collections up every few days, so keep checking back! Pinterest on Parade Our local Pinterest teams will be participating in official Pride parades across the globe, from San Francisco to London. In the UK, Pinterest has also collaborated with Pride in London to curate a board of even more inspiring ideas for this year’s Pride. The Celebrating Pride board can be found on the Pinterest UK and Pride in London profiles. Company Pride One essential ingredient to building a product for a world of different Pinners is to hire a team of Pinployees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. It takes all kinds to build a product for all kinds. That’s just one of many reasons we work so hard to hire people of all ages, colors, sizes and genders. To make sure everyone who works here feels included and supported, we offer a selection of carefully considered benefits like: Adoption and surrogacy benefits to support all prospective parents. Support for IVF and egg freezing. A parental leave policy that provides 16 weeks paid leave to all moms and dads––including adoptive parents––which can be broken into chunks and taken anytime throughout the year. Gender-neutral bathrooms in every Pinterest office. Volunteer opportunities with local organizations like Maven to empower LGBTQ+ youth and other underserved groups. If any of that sounds good to you, we’re also hiring! We’d love to have your help as we build the product people around the world love and use every day. Happy Pride-ing!"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/summer-2018-fashion-and-beauty-trends","date":"2018-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Beauty","Style","Trends"],"title":"Say hello to summer with these hot fashion and beauty trends","text":"Say “bye bye!” to dark clothes and dramatic blowouts for the next three months.

Now, all new UI components of Pinterest are more inclusive for Pinners who are blind and visually impaired. As a result, it’s much easier for you to browse, search and save ideas on Pinterest. Our mission is to help you discover and do what you love, and we want everyone to be included in that mission. That’s why we partnered with Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired to better understand how we could make Pinterest more useful for people with different levels of vision. After talking with Pinners and learning how Pinterest was (and wasn’t) working for them, we did an accessibility audit and created a list of areas to improve. Some of these include: Better screen reader support makes signing up, browsing and saving easier and more usable. Color contrast sensitivity improvements make our color palettes more readable and easier on the eyes. This is especially helpful for Pinners with sensitivities to bright colors and those who have low vision. Focus indicators help people with mobility or visual differences use a keyboard or another device to navigate to see which part of the site is in focus. We also created accessibility best practices for engineers and designers, in addition to a new UI library with accessible components. As we develop and design Pinterest, accessibility checks are now in place to ensure we have clearly labeled icons and components for any new feature. We’re continuing to make Pinterest more inclusive of everyone. We’ve made significant progress updating our iOS and web platforms to meet the majority of the accessibility standards, and we’re working on bringing these changes to Android soon."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-the-following-tab","date":"2018-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing the following tab","text":"Today we’re starting to roll out the following tab—a place focused entirely on the people and boards you follow on Pinterest.

In talking with Pinners, we found that some people only wanted recommendations, while others liked to curate their feed—and most people wanted both options.

You can see and control who you follow by tapping the “+” button at the top of the following tab.

These features will help you stay organized as you complete projects big and small, like decorating a nursery, planning a wedding or cooking Valentine’s Day dinner. Archive boards Starting today, you can archive a board once you’re finished with it. Archiving not only helps you clean up your profile so you can get back to your current projects more quickly, it also improves the relevance of your recommendations and notifications. So when you archive your wedding board after the big day, you’ll stop seeing recommendations for dresses, bouquets and other related ideas. To archive a board, tap the Edit button on your board, then tap Archive. You can find your archived boards in a new section at the bottom of your profile. While only you can see your archived boards, you can still share them with family or friends using the Send button. Reorder sections We recently launched sections to help you organize Pins on a board into different topics. Based on continued feedback from Pinners, we’re now adding the ability to rearrange those sections so it’s easier to access them. For example, if you’re taking a trip, you can order sections according to your itinerary. If you’re meal planning, you can move this week’s recipes to the top of your board."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/celebrating-one-year-of-pinterest-lens","date":"2018-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product","Technology"],"title":"Celebrating one year of Pinterest Lens","text":"A year ago we introduced Lens, a first-of-its-kind camera search that recommends ideas to try inspired by things you see offline. Since its launch, we’ve been thrilled to hear all the ways Pinners are using Lens in their lives. For example, Krissy, a Pinner in Georgia, uses Lens at the grocery store to find recipes based on what’s on sale—like these avocado fries. And others use Lens to find outfits for date night, to try new beauty looks or even reverse engineer some of their favorite restaurant dishes. Today there are more than twice as many Pinners using Lens every day compared to just six months ago. People now do more than 600 million visual searches every month across Lens, our browser extension and the visual search tool inside Pins. That’s a 140 percent increase year over year. Over the last year, the more people searched, the better Lens got. We moved Lens to the front of our apps and gave it its first makeover. We also added shortcuts to make it faster to search. We introduced Pincodes, a QR code-type technology which enables you to find inspiration while you're out shopping or flipping through your favorite magazines. We also launched Lens your Look to take the guesswork out of outfit planning and bring together text and image searches in one query. We partnered with Samsung to bring visual search to its latest smartphones worldwide. We also worked with Target to give you a way to search their catalog using related products you see in the real world. The visual search technology that powers Lens is more advanced than ever. Compared to a year ago, it understands more than five times as many things, including hundreds of recipe ingredients, thousands of styles of clothing and countless more objects you might find around your home. The underlying visual model is rebuilt nightly, which means we’re continuously recognizing new objects and improving our accuracy. And of course we’re still hard at work bringing you more ways to Lens. Next week, we’ll start rolling out the ability to add Lens images to any text search on iOS (Android coming soon). So you can find a piece of art for your walls, a couch that’ll go with your favorite armchair or a casserole recipe that uses that weird vegetable you just discovered. To wrap up, we’re celebrating a year of Lens by sharing some search trends. Top categories for Lens searches: Fashion Home decor Art Food Products Animals Outfits Beauty Vehicles Travel Top trending Lens searches: Tattoos Nails Sunglasses Jeans Cats Wedding dress Plants Quilts Brownies Natural hair Thank you to Pinners for helping us improve Lens every day."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/building-a-pinterest-for-everyone-2017","date":"2017-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","@8en"],"title":"Building a Pinterest for Everyone: 2017 Inclusion & Diversity Report","text":"Our mission at Pinterest is to help people discover and do what they love. Hundreds of millions of people come to us to get ideas and inspiration for their lives. And our goal every day is to deliver for our Pinners. To do that, we want to bring in the best talent we can and create a work environment where people can do their best work. That is why one of our top priorities is building a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace. Diversity and inclusion mean a lot to us personally. They are also good for our business. Bringing in people with different backgrounds, ideas and perspectives helps us fulfill our mission and strengthens our company. A few years after we started Pinterest, we were growing quickly and we realized that we had to make a concrete effort to build a diverse and inclusive culture. So we got to work. That started with how we hire. In 2015, we became one of the first tech companies to set annual public hiring goals, after being one of the first to publicly share numbers in the prior years. Though we still have work to do, we have made a lot of progress. Over the past two years, the number of people from underrepresented ethnic groups working at Pinterest grew from 3% to 9% of the company. Women in tech roles (engineers, product management and design) increased from 21% to 29%. In 2017, specifically, we hit two of our three hiring goals. Here are the details: We wanted to increase hiring rates for full-time women engineers to 25%. We exceeded it and reached 26%. We wanted to increase hiring rates for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds to 8%. We fell short at 5%. We wanted to increase hiring rates for people from underrepresented backgrounds in non-engineering roles to 12%. We exceeded this goal by reaching 15%. How did we do this? Of course there's room for improvement, but we're encouraged by the results. One highlight this year was our apprenticeship program which opens doors for self-taught coders. There are a lot of talented people who don’t come from computer science backgrounds but still have a lot to offer. So we started this initiative to help talented candidates get their foot in the door, and have hired a number of apprentices to become full-time engineers. Another highlight was how we have expanded the talent pool when looking for candidates. We now interview at least one person from an underrepresented background and one female for every open leadership position. This is modeled after an NFL initiative called the “Rooney Rule.” This year we expanded this effort to include senior management roles so that we are getting the best candidates for positions at all levels of the company. These are just some examples of the work we’re doing. We have come a long way. But we still have work to do. In 2018, we will try to achieve the same aggressive goals that we had this year and bring in more people who will strengthen our business and product. We also know that it’s not enough to focus on hiring. We are also focusing on inclusion. Pinterest has made inclusion a priority. People do their best work when they know they are valued and respected at the office. And every day, we strive to make our work environment a place where people can innovate instead of worrying about other things. So how did we make Pinterest more inclusive? Well, we did a few things. We looked at what our really great managers were doing to build inclusive teams and created a playbook based on those principles so that leaders at all levels could put those practices into action. We added a checkpoint during performance reviews so managers could pause and identify any common biases they may have been making. We made unconscious bias training a priority for employees and managers so they can be aware of any hidden preferences they may hold. This work is making a difference. We are proud that industry studies say that Pinterest is one of the best companies for diversity and for women to work. And we are going to continue doing everything we can to create a culture where everyone feels like they belong and can focus on doing their jobs. We are also working with Partners to scale these efforts. Diversity isn’t just good for Pinterest—it’s good for the whole industry. We all benefit when more people get the chance to contribute and innovate. So in addition to our internal efforts, we have also looked for ways to support other organizations doing really important work. One of them is called /dev/color. Started by a former Pinterest engineer, this non-profit helps Black engineers build their careers and grow as industry leaders. We all know that historically it’s been way too hard for Black developers to get opportunities in the tech industry. /dev/color’s goal is to address those barriers so that talented individuals can get jobs and start businesses. Another example is Paradigm, which develops strategies to help companies do better when it comes to diversity and inclusion. They use a lot of amazing data and research to help organizations examine and improve the way they hire and operate. Their work has helped strengthen a lot of companies of all sizes. Both of these organizations actually have space at our headquarters. And we are really glad to be a part of their work to open doors for others. We know this will be a long journey and that we have a lot of work to do. But we are confident that it will make our business and our industry better. And we look forward to sharing our progress in our update next year."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-100-the-top-trends-to-try-in-2018","date":"2017-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Beauty","Celebrations","Food","Home","Lifestyle","Parenting","Seasons","Style","Travel","Trends","Weddings","@pinterest"],"title":"Pinterest 100: The top trends to try in 2018","text":"The results are in, and there’s a lot to look forward to in 2018!

But if you’ve saved hundreds of ideas to a single board, it can be hard to find what you’re looking for. That’s why we’re launching board sections—a new way to organize your Pins on Pinterest. Now you can save all your favorite ideas to a single board, organize them into sections and easily find them when you’re ready to try them. We’ve been testing this feature with a small group of passionate Pinners, and their feedback inspired ideas to make sections even more useful. With the addition of some cool new features, we’re now ready to roll it out to everyone. Here are just a few of the ways we think they’ll help you stay organized. Organize your ideas To start organizing, go to one of your boards and tap “Add section.” From there, pick the Pins you want to add and voila—you’ve got a section! You can save new ideas to it like you always do, like using the Pinterest save button for your browser. Need a little inspiration? Here’s how I’m using sections on my Seasons Eatings board. Clean up your boards Do you have separate boards for each room in your house? Or for each project you want to try? Now you can move all the Pins from your similar boards into one board with sections. Just head to your board, tap “Organize” and pick the Pins you want to move. Plan for the holidays From party planning to wishlisting to getaway-ing, sections make it easy to get ready for the holidays. Here are just a few ways you can use them for your own holiday prep. Secret shopping: Start a secret board with sections for each person who’s getting a gift this season Friendly feasting: Organize your Friendsgiving board by main courses, sides, pies and wines Lots of layers: Move your winter styles to a new board with sections for warm sweaters, tall boots, wool coats and more Deck the halls: Light up your home with decoration ideas organized by each room in the house Sections will be rolling out over the next few days to everyone on iOS, Android and web.

Today, we’re excited to announce the grand opening of the Workshop, a first-of-its-kind creative studio and social club at Pinterest HQ, fully equipped with professional equipment, art supplies and more. The Workshop was born out of two beliefs. Making something by hand is powerful, and bringing together diverse, passionate people is magical. This is Pinterest’s antidote to a virtually-connected culture. It’s an offline destination that promotes our mission in a meaningful way, allowing people to discover and do what they love—in real life. And there’s just one rule in the Workshop: Never ever ever stop trying. Everyone is welcome. Pinners, Pinterest employees, influencers and our business partners can create projects, practice techniques and teach skills, as well as share advice and build relationships. Monthly and quarterly programming and special events will pop up throughout the year as well. Additional amenities include a Library of Inspiration, meeting spaces, a fully-stocked kitchen, lactation room and shower room. On one side of the space, a Try Wall features up to 20 specially-selected projects in popular categories like home, style and food, that you can do right then and there. Pinterest influencers, AKA Pinsiders, have a unique opportunity to spark creativity and create an authentic conversation with their audiences to help bridge the gap between ambition and accessibility. Video and lighting equipment makes it even easier to bring Pinterest ideas to life and share across platforms. They can take the viewer through the process, whether it’s how to master something, or the pitfalls to avoid, and share their personal tips and tricks. Their thoughtful storytelling will give others the confidence to try something new—our ultimate goal. Last night, 100+ Pinsiders visited the Workshop for a mix-and-mingle maker fest. Power Pinners like Studio DIY, Honestly WTF and Style Weekender led guests through various projects at hands-on Trypods. Actress Emma Roberts and producer Karah Preiss took the stage for a Q&A session and discussed topics like moving beyond fear and self doubt, taking risks and how they launched their business, Belletrist, an online community that celebrates great books and the people who read them."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/got-a-pinterest-story-to-share-were-all-ears","date":"2017-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"Got a Pinterest story to share?

As it turns out, curiosity and the desire to try new things are universal. Every year, more and more people come to Pinterest to explore their unique interests and tastes. Now people from all walks of life and all corners of the world use it to discover and do what they love. As of today, more than 200 million people use Pinterest every month. That’s two hundred million people discovering new ideas and trying them in their real lives, from Salt Lake City to Rio to Tokyo. We’ve grown nearly 40 percent since last year, and more than half of all Pinners live outside the U.S.—if Pinland were a country, it’d be the 7th largest in the world! You’ve helped build Pinterest’s giant collection of more than 100 billion ideas, and you’ve dreamed up some of our best features. To thank you for helping us get here, we’re doing a few things we hope you’ll love. Features you’ve always wanted Get ready for a slew of new features inspired by you. You’ve told us what you want to see next, so we’re building them—it’s that simple. We started with pinch-to-zoom, and there’s much more to come. While we aren’t spilling all the beans today, the first feature on the list is sure to knock your socks off. Board sections are coming We’ve just started testing one of the features you’ve wanted the most: boards within boards. Soon you’ll be able to add sections to your boards, making it easy to organize Pins the way you want to. This means you can save all your ideas to a single board, organize into sections, and easily find them later. If you don’t have access to sections just yet, hang tight. We plan on making them available to everyone once we’re done testing them out. Early access to the latest from Pinterest In the next few weeks, we’ll be inviting Pinners to help us test our newest ideas. For helping us out, you’ll get access to some of our most highly anticipated and requested features before anyone else. Stay tuned for an update about how to snag an invite. Pinterest wouldn’t be here without you, and we hope to thank you with these Pinner-inspired features. We can’t wait to show you what we’re cooking up.

That’s why we’ve been building visual discovery features to help you find things when you don’t have the words to describe them. We recently brought search and Lens to your home feed, so you can easily get to it when you first open your Pinterest app. Now we’re adding a couple more ways to find exactly what you’re looking for, right from the Pin closeup. Pinch to zoom in on a Pin Lots of Pins have all kinds of good stuff in them, and sometimes you want to get a closer look at every inch. Starting today, you can zoom in on anything you see in a Pin. So the next time you spot a pair of shoes you love, pinch to zoom in on all the details, like texture and color. People have been telling us they’d love a way to zoom in on Pins—it’s one of our top requested features. That’s why we’re excited to bring it to iPhone and iPad (all you Androiders will be seeing it soon!). Visual search gets better and better Lots of people have been using our visual search tool to find related products and ideas inside Pins—in fact, visual searches on Pinterest have grown 60 percent over the last year. We’ve made some improvements to the tool based on feedback we’ve heard from Pinners. We updated the button so it’s clearer, especially for people who are new to Pinterest, and moved it so it’s a little easier to reach. And it’s working too—in early tests of the improved button, nearly 70 percent more people used the visual search tool. Don’t forget you can also do visual searches around the web using the Pinterest Save button for your browser—and starting today, you don’t even need a Pinterest account to do visual searches from Chrome. We’re always looking for new ways to help you discover ideas you love on Pinterest. Give zoom and the visual search tool a go—we can’t wait to see what you find! – Jeff Harris, currently saving ideas to jeffjoy house"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/search-and-lens-move-front-and-center","date":"2017-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product","Technology"],"title":"Search and Lens move front and center","text":"When you fire up your Pinterest app today, you may notice a small but very helpful new improvement. Now, instead of having to open the Explore tab to search for ideas to try, you simply type what you’re looking for into the new search bar at the top of your home feed. You also have the Lens camera right there at the ready, so when you spot something out in the world that looks interesting, you can quickly tap open Lens to snap a photo and find related ideas. To get search and Lens on your home feed, update your iOS app (coming to Android soon!). More and more people are searching for ideas We’re making it easier for people to search for ideas on their phones because that’s what an increasing number of people are coming here to do. Monthly mobile text searches are up 40 percent over last year, and nearly 85 percent of all searches on Pinterest now happen on people’s phones. Thanks to our visual discovery features, monthly visual searches have increased nearly 60 percent over last year. And our search returns 20 percent more Pins, with nearly four billion ideas getting served up each and every day. What makes Pinterest search so different More and more people are searching Pinterest for ideas because what they find here is different from everywhere else. Traditional search engines are great for when people have something specific they want to know, like what’s the weather like today? Pinterest is where people come when they’re not quite sure what they want yet. Maybe they’re looking for ideas for what to do today, or what to wear. They’re open to possibilities. And when they come across an idea that looks good, they can explore related ideas until they find exactly what works best for them. This kind of open-minded searching is what makes Pinterest so unique. You don’t need to know what something’s called, or which brand made it. You can start your search broad then quickly narrow in on the specific solution that’s right for you. In fact, 73 percent of all Pinterest traffic comes from people who start off their search with just one to three keywords. And 97 percent of all searches on Pinterest don’t include a brand name. So if you’re someone like Jacob, who lives in Portland, OR and needed a new jacket for those chilly Northwestern nights, you can poke around and discover the right style for you (like this casual barbour coat that’s now Jacob’s go-to warm layer). Even more behind-the-scenes improvements Not only are search and Lens now right up top, but we’ve also made some improvements behind the scenes, so your home feed is more useful than ever. Now the recommendations you find in your home feed are fresher than ever, updating instantly based on what you're saving and searching on Pinterest. To help make sure you see a good variety of ideas in your feed, we’ve also been working to zap repeat Pins. As of today, we’ve managed to almost totally eliminate exact duplicates. Together we hope all these new improvements make it even easier to find the next idea you want to try! -Audrey Tsang, product manager for home feed, is currently using Pinterest to search for recipes"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/more-tools-and-a-new-look-for-lens","date":"2017-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Technology"],"title":"More tools and a new look for Lens","text":"Pinterest Lens beta is really on a roll. Just last month, we announced that you can Lens entire dishes to recreate your favorite restaurant meals at home. Now, we’re rolling out a fresh look for Lens, more helpful tools and a newly heightened sense of style. Smarter and more stylish than ever Over the last month, we’ve doubled the number of categories Lens has been trained to recognize. We’ve also upped its style game, so Lens can recognize and recommend outfit ideas for a much wider variety shoes, shirts, hats and other styles you’re wanting to wear. And, the new interface and built-in tools make it even easier to Lens the world around you. Tap to focus & pinch to zoom To get the best results, you need to start with a sharp, clear photo. We’ve added new zoom and focus features, so you can pinpoint exactly what you’re looking for. We've heard many of you wait until later to Lens the photos you take, so we've also made it easier to get right to the latest pics from your camera roll, which you’ll now find waiting for you right when you open up Lens. See related ideas instantly Lens results now include the “instant ideas” button (that little white circle in the corner of each Pin). So when Lens serves up an idea you like the looks of, you can tap the circle to instantly see more possibilities inspired by that original idea. And you can keep going from there, tapping more circles and finding more ideas you love. Before long, you find yourself “down the Pinterest rabbit hole,” as many Pinners like to describe it, going deeper and deeper from good idea to good idea until you find something so perfect for you, you want to put down your phone and give it a try. Because really, that's what Pinterest is all about: helping you discover possibilities to design your life, whether you’re re-tiling your backsplash, baking your kid a birthday cake or tracking down the exact right shoes for that outfit. -Anton Herasymenko, product designer, is currently Lensing ideas for his board Material"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/new-ways-to-protect-your-pinterest-account","date":"2017-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Technology"],"title":"New ways to protect your Pinterest account","text":"Pinterest is full of possibilities for your life—ideas that you’ve taken the time to find and save, and we want to protect them. Today we’re announcing new features to make your account even more secure. Secure your account Over the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out two-factor authentication to everyone. This feature adds extra security by requiring a verification code each time you log in. Get the code via text message, or download Twilio’s Authy app for even stronger security. Once it’s available, just head to the Security section of your account settings on the web. Two-factor authentication protects your whole account once it’s enabled—so if you turn it on from the web, you’ll need a code to log in on any device, like your iPhone or Android phone. Review your devices In that same Security section, you’ll also find a list of all devices logged in to your account. If you see a device you don’t recognize—or a date, time or location that seems fishy—you can quickly remove it. Check your email If we see a login from a new device or location, we’ll send you an email to give you a heads up. If it was you, you’re all set! If it wasn’t, you can quickly reset your password to secure your account. As always, make sure you have a strong and unique password. For more security tips, check out our Help Center.

While social networks are fueled by likes and living in the past, Pinterest is all about making plans, getting offline and trying things IRL. 84% of people on Pinterest say it helps them learn new things,1 and 70% of people search, save or click through on Pins to learn more.2 So we know they’re not just browsing—they’re ready to take action. And because our mission is to help people discover and do things they love, we’ve been launching new features like Lens beta and recipe search filters that make it even easier to make your next move and try something new. But there’s one major barrier to trying new things, especially for women: that voice in your head that makes you doubt yourself. And that’s why our first ad campaign, launching today in the U.S., is all about putting self-doubt in its place and owning the best-case scenario. We want to bring possibilities to life through two simple words: What if. What ifs in the wild Our What if campaign focuses on vulnerable moments people face in their lives, from everyday to epic, when they’re just about to take a risk. The stakes can feel high any time you try something new, whether you’re wearing bold lipstick, ditching the conventional wedding or breaking free from gender norms. We want to show the transformative power of reimagining risks as possibilities. Our in-house creative team worked alongside advertising icon and writer Janet Champ. Janet was the perfect spirit guide and creative consultant for this campaign—she has a long history of work on progressive campaigns for women, like Nike’s “If You Let Me Play.” Her work is all about pushing past barriers to reveal your true potential—kindred spirits with our focus on possibilities. In every ad, we’re showing real people, not models—Pinterest employees and close friends—to keep it feeling grounded, relatable and true to the real-life spirit of what if. You’ll also notice that we intentionally didn’t focus on outcomes, since achieving a perfect end result is far less important to us than taking a chance and trying something new. Look ma, we’re in Times Square! We worked with media agency Giant Spoon, and starting today you’ll see our first out of home ads peppered throughout New York City. We’ll also be running static and video postings on social. Meanwhile in the coming months, we’ll be partnering with Mic and The New York Times, and we’re busy planning a few events, special guests and surprises for later this fall. Stay tuned for lots more what if moments ahead. —Mac Huynh, currently saving ideas to Power women 1Pinterest, consumer study, 2016 2Pinterest, activity analysis, 2015"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/whats-for-dinner-we-got-you-covered-with-new-food-features","date":"2017-04-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product","Technology"],"title":"What’s for dinner?

When the event schedule comes out, I flip through it like an excited college freshman flipping through a course catalog. Full of new ideas, full of possibilities. Knit Con 2017 schedule Knit happens at Pinterest Pinterest helps hundreds of millions of people discover and do what they love, and it’s just as important we do that for our employees too. Our company is made up of talented individuals who are not only experts in their fields, but passionate about pursuits outside of the office. We look for people with more interests than time, people who genuinely get excited when they talk about creating and doing things in their professional and personal lives. We have a core set of values at Pinterest: Put Pinners First, Go, Be Authentic and Knit. The last one is major. \"Knitting\" is when everyone works together, from engineering and design to marketing and community, to create the best experience for Pinners. True invention happens when different points of view are connected. This is how Pinterest was created, after all. An inside look at Knit Con One big way knitting is brought to life is through Knit Con. It’s a laptop-free, meeting-free event that takes place over the course of two days in the Pinterest offices around the world (San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, London, Sao Paulo and Tokyo). Employees show off and share what they’re most passionate about through hands-on workshops and classes. It’s basically an analog version of Pinterest. Every year, I’m amazed and inspired by the hidden interests and secret superpowers of my co-workers. There’s way too many to list, but here are a few session highlights and pics: - So hot right now: How to build a fire was a popular session led by Charlie Hale, our head of public policy and captain of his college timbersports team/competitive fire builder (yep, it’s a thing). - People were stoked to see brand designer #1, Victor Ng, return. Victor left us for NYC to work on the Hillary Clinton campaign and is currently a designer at the New York Times. Writing manager Sadia Latifi hosted a Q&A with him called From Pinterest to politics: Designing in the age of alternative facts. - Pinner experience manager Jordan Skye Paul led a discussion with Gyasi Ross, a Native activist, lawyer and writer, about Standing Rock and the current political climate. - Pinterest has always had a soft spot for Corgis, so everyone was pretty jealous of London’s training and petting session.

Montgomery Park. Two members of the Chicago team help clean up Ward A. Montgomery Park It was a real treat to hear keynotes from industry professionals, celebrities, athletes and legends. These were two of my favorites: - Chris Mosier, the first openly transgender athlete to make a U.S. national team said about Pinterest, “I very much was creating an image of the person I wanted to be.” We all burst with emotion and pride in that moment. - Mellody Hobson, President of Ariel Capital, talked about how she strives to make her company truly unique and encourages “No me toos.” This week, I saw “no me too” signs around the office that the brand team made.

In her keynote, Mellody Hobson said to us, “You have the life that you want. You chose this. By choosing to be here, you can continue to make this company great.

Diverse teams come with a broader set of experiences, which means they often have new perspectives and ideas. That’s important for Pinterest as we set out to help people around the world discover and do things they love. Even though we always valued diversity, as we grew quickly, we found that we started to look more and more like a typical technology company—we just didn’t see as many women or underrepresented minorities on our team. That’s why last year we decided to create goals to increase the diversity of our team and share them publicly. Just having good intentions around diversity hadn't been enough, so we thought setting goals would help us focus across the company. At first, we debated sharing these goals because diversity is such a sensitive topic. But we believed that erring on the side of being open about our progress and what we learned is the best way to help the whole technology industry become more diverse and inclusive. Our efforts improved our hiring process and resulted in the most diverse team Pinterest has had to date. We didn’t make as much progress as we’d like, but we learned a lot that’s going to help us create an even more diverse Pinterest next year. In 2016, we increased the number of women in technical roles from 21% to 26% and more than doubled the number of people in the company from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds to 7%. We increased the hiring rate of engineers from underrepresented ethnic groups from 1% to 9%. We were also able to bring on new senior leaders like Li Fan, our head of engineering, Ruben Ortega, head of our Seattle engineering office, August de los Reyes, head of product design and Candice Morgan, head of diversity. These numbers don’t reflect all the effort that also went into making sure Pinterest as a culture became more inclusive. And it all happened at a time we scaled our company rapidly, growing by 51% this year. What we learned Growing more diverse teams takes deliberate, thoughtful work, and it’s not easy. It requires conviction, long-term commitment and a willingness to confront difficult issues. Here are a few things we learned: 1. It’s crucial to continuously talk about why diversity matters. It’s important to talk about why diversity is important as much as how we build a more diverse and inclusive team. We put the processes in place to make the company focus on our new goals, but we would’ve made faster progress if we made sure every hiring manager understood how a diverse company advances our goal of building world class products. We missed an opportunity to delve deeper and get managers to take ownership of the company’s goals alongside recruiters. If we could go back, we’d spend more time explaining the why as much as the how. 2. Hiring senior leadership from diverse backgrounds is important and requires its own effort. A lot of companies focus on bringing in diverse junior talent because they’re easier to hire—but having diverse senior leaders is just as important. When you’re trying to build an inclusive culture, people need to see representation amongst their peers and across senior leadership. Recruiting for executive roles is its own challenge. While we brought on many new leaders from different backgrounds, we could have spent more time on this in the first half of the year. 3. Focusing on diversity improved our entire recruiting process. Our new goals helped us improve internal recruiting practices. We revamped our employee referral process to be more targeted (and therefore more useful) and made our interviewing process more efficient. We rolled out unconscious bias training to all of our interviewers. We experimented with external resourcing firms and while many are great to work with, we got more success when we improved our internal processes. 4. Inclusion and diversity go hand in hand. Creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels engaged and valued is just as important as getting someone in the door. This year we created new internal programs, including employee-led unconscious bias training for all new hires, Inclusion Labs in partnership with Paradigm, and the launch of new employee communities, like Vets@, sponsored by CFO Todd Morgenfeld, and blackboard, our Black employee group. 5. There’s value in pushing the whole industry. Even though the market for hiring is incredibly competitive, we want to go beyond Pinterest and be a small part of pushing the industry forward. We worked closely with organizations like /dev/color and Blavity and partner with other tech companies on creating new solutions. We hosted events that were designed to bring the underrepresented minorities and women in tech communities together without the explicit purpose of recruiting them. We also launched an apprenticeship program to help people transition to tech. We think being open with our efforts and joining the larger community is the right thing to do to help all of us in this industry. How we did in 2016 Increase hiring rates for full-time women engineers to 30%. While we increased the number of women in engineering and technical roles overall, we didn’t reach our goal of a 30% hiring rate for women in engineering. We ended the year at a 22% hiring rate for women engineers starting in 2016. How we’re making sense of this gap: One reason we missed is because we decided to prioritize hiring senior women engineers, and senior hires take longer. Additionally, 49% of engineering interns were women, up from 32% last year. Increase hiring rates for engineers from underrepresented backgrounds to 8%. We surpassed this goal. The hiring rate for engineers from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds grew to 9%, up from 1% last year. 30% of the underrepresented engineers hired are in senior roles. The number of underrepresented ethnic minorities for our 2017 new grad engineering class thus far grew to over 9%, up from <2% in 2015. About 20% of our engineering interns in 2016 came from underrepresented ethnic groups, up from 4% in 2015 Increase hiring rates for people from underrepresented backgrounds to non-engineering roles to 12%. We reached this goal, increasing the hiring rate for people from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds in non-engineering roles to 12%, up from 7% last year. Underrepresented minorities now make up 7% of our entire workforce, more than doubling from last year. Implement a Rooney Rule-like requirement where at least one candidate from an underrepresented background and one female candidate is interviewed for every open leadership position. Many of our new senior leaders came from underrepresented backgrounds this year, especially in engineering, including Li Fan, head of engineering and Ruben Ortega, head of our Seattle engineering office. In addition, Michelle Wilson became the first independent member of our board. *Women in tech includes women in engineering, product design and product management **Underrepresented groups include Black, Hispanic, and Native American What’s next in 2017 We’re ready to set new goals in 2017. We updated our women in engineering hiring rate goal to 25% for 2017. We still aspire to 30%—but realize it’s likely going to take more than 12 months to get there. And since we’ve seen so much success with the Rooney Rule for executive roles, we’re extending it to more teams. Our goals for 2017 are: Increase hiring rates for full-time women engineers to 25% Maintain hiring rates for engineers from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds at least 8% Maintain hiring rates for people from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds in business roles at least 12% Extend our Rooney Rule-type requirement to interview at least one person from an underrepresented background and one female candidate for all top-level managerial positions, in addition to exec roles —Ben Silbermann, CEO"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/the-pinterest-100-the-top-ideas-to-try-in-2017","date":"2016-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Beauty","Food","Home","Lifestyle","Seasons","Style","Travel"],"title":"The Pinterest 100: The top ideas to try in 2017","text":"There are all kinds of recaps and best-ofs this time of year, but instead of looking back, we’re jumping ahead.

What to wear to the office party? Which cheerful drinks and finger foods should you serve at your own holiday spread? What are you going to get your kid for Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or their unfortunately timed December birthday? As the holiday questions start to pile up, it’s easy to get overwhelmed (AKA fetal up in bed for the next 4 weeks). But take comfort: Pinterest is here with 6 different ways—some of them spanking new—to make your holidays a little easier this year. 1. Look for tried-and-true ideas—NEW! If you’re thinking about adding a new bauble to the tree, or maybe debuting a new holiday tradition or dish, start your experimenting with an idea that people have already tried and given their stamp of approval to—like this confirmed doable cactus tree dangler, or this universally devoured fresh green bean casserole, or these weirdly great elf-on-the-shelfies. 2. Explore the NEW! Pinterest Explore Tap into Pinterest Explore each day for a regularly rotating crop of surprising food and gift ideas, from what’s trending to what Pinterest tastemakers are loving today. Maybe you’ll find the perfect freakout-worthy gift for your favorite coworker. Or maybe you’ll find a holiday nibble you may have never found otherwise (oh hi, spirited selection of holidoozy drinks). 3. Search the nooks and corners Spot something in a Pin that you’re sure would be perfect for so-and-so? Tap the magnifying glass in the top right corner of the Pin to highlight just the part you’re interested in, then feast your eyes on a selection of similar looking Pins. 4. Use group boards to crowdsource your holiday plans As the sages say, many hands make light work. And when it comes to gift buying and party planning, things are indeed infinitely easier when you spread the cheer (and ice-buying responsibilities) across the shoulders of friends and family. All you have to do is create a board, add collaborators, and you’re ready to brainstorm the best group gift for Grandfather Dan (AKA “GranDan”), or crowdsource the best salmonella-free eggnog recipe for this year’s holiday party. 5. Keep things on the shhhh with secret boards If the person you’re collecting gift ideas for is a notorious snoop (looking at you, GranDan), you can always make your gift-storm board secret so they don’t get wind of your plans. 6. Save time by buying gifts on Pinterest As you’re browsing for gift ideas, keep your peepers peeled for Pins with blue price tags, which you can buy right on Pinterest. Buying on Pinterest means you only have to type in your card info and mailing address once—you can buy from any store that sells on Pinterest (from smaller shops like Modern Citizen to big guys like Wayfair) without having to go to their site and set up an account. We hope these tips help make your holidays just a little bit merrier and brighter. - Evany Thomas is currently saving ideas to the the Pinterest employee holiday cookie group board"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/explore-todays-top-ideas","date":"2016-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Home","Lifestyle","Trends"],"title":"Explore today’s top ideas","text":"There are over 75 billion ideas on Pinterest, and people around the world save millions more here every single day.

And everything else you're used to seeing is here too, including: - Your own personalized recommendations - The ideas people you know are saving and liking in the topics you care about most - Who all’s been following your boards, and liking and saving the same ideas as you - Which new boards people are creating, and finding to follow Tap for more ideas you love Your notifications are also now way more visual than before, so you clearly see which of your Pins people liked and saved, and what new ideas people are discovering.

We actually believe they can be a welcome way to discover products and services you truly want in your life. That’s why ever since we first launched promoted Pins 2 years ago, we’ve been working hard to make sure they feel relevant to you. Over the years, we’ve gotten even better at connecting you to the ideas and products you most want to see. So if you use Pinterest to get style ideas, you might see a promoted Pin for a winter coat that matches whatever shapes and colors you’ve been loving lately. Or if food’s more your thing, you might see a promoted Pin for a gourmet meal delivery service. To help make sure you’re happy with what you’re seeing, promoted Pins always include a way to give feedback so we can keep improving which Pins we show you. We’ve even made some improvements to the Pins themselves: We’ve created 3 new types of promoted Pins, each designed to make it a little easier for you to give the Pin a try. New kinds of promoted Pins—one-tap, video and app One-tap Pins: Just tap a one-tap Pin in your feed to jump directly to the site it came from so you can quickly learn more. We’ve only just started showing these Pins on Pinterest, but people already seem to be loving how much easier it is to get right to the products they’re looking for. In fact, almost twice as many Pinners are finding items to buy through these new Pins. For now, we’re only letting a handful of select businesses promote one-tap Pins, so you may not see them right away. But just keep your eyes peeled for the arrow icon, which you’ll find in the lower corner of each one-tap Pin. Video Pins: We’re also introducing promoted video Pins, which play right on Pinterest—no more clicking off to another site before you can watch. You’ll also find a selection of related ideas that help you learn more about how things work, or buy products you spotted in the video."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/150-million-people-finding-ideas-on-pinterest","date":"2016-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","@8en"],"title":"150 million people finding ideas on Pinterest","text":"Today we're excited to announce that our community has grown to more than 150 million people around the world using Pinterest every month. And we’ve got over 75 billion ideas waiting here for them to try. But what’s most exciting to me is just how diverse this group of people has become since Pinterest launched in 2010. Over half of people on Pinterest, and 75% of new signups, are from outside the United States. And while Pinterest used to be thought of as mostly just for women, now 40% of people who join are men—that’s 70% more than this time last year! But what’s most inspiring is seeing all the different ways these people are using Pinterest. People are trying all kinds of ideas on Pinterest One of the best things about Pinterest is that it gives you ideas for how to make everyday life easier, tastier and even more colorful. Here’s just a few things real people are trying on Pinterest right now... Tiana, hair color adventurer Dyed her own hair (with mixed results):I used a box color which was a terrible idea. My roots lightened to the right color but the rest of my hair didn’t. Lots of Pins suggested going to a professional so it was my fault! Steven, new homeowner and DIY guy Built his own breakfast nook:It was harder than I thought, but doable. Good carpenters say, “measure twice, cut once.” Well, let’s just say there was a lot of measuring. Ryan, guitarist with good taste Found a truly versatile fall jacket:When I get dressed and finally look in the mirror I think, \"This is me.\" I feel comfortable in my own skin. I don’t really worry about what people are thinking. Theresa, consultant by day / chef by night Found over 60 new recipes to try:Kale salad with pecorino and lemon is my secret weapon. It looks and tastes great...but only takes 5 minutes to prep. As a Pinner once said to me, “Pinterest is for yourself, not your selfies”—I love that. Pinterest is more of a personal tool than a social one. People don’t come to see what their friends are doing. (There are lots of other great places out there for that!) Instead, they come to Pinterest to find ideas to try, figure out which ones they love, and learn a little bit about themselves in the process. Personally I can’t wait to see what new ideas all these people bring to Pinterest, and find out what happens when they give those ideas a try.

Today, we’re making a few changes based on all the helpful feedback we’ve heard. Pinterest messaging made easy In the past, you and a friend had to follow each other on Pinterest to send a message or board invite. We did this to protect our community from spammers, but it obviously made it harder to quickly and easily send things to your friends. Over the years, our top notch spam team has been improving our technology, so now you can send a friend Pins and invites even if you aren’t following each other. We've also improved search, so it's easier to find people you know. If you’re decorating your new apartment, you can create a group board and invite your roommates to share furniture and other home ideas. Send Pins however you want Now you can send Pins, boards and profiles to friends across apps—Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, text message—whatever way you usually communicate with each other. A new way to finetune your home feed A couple of years back, we introduced \"Picked for you\" Pins in people's home feed. Tons of people love these recommendations, and they get a lot of likes and saves (600 million saves every month!)—especially from new Pinners. But a small number of you have told us that you aren't a fan. And we get it. If you spend time curating your home feed—following and unfollowing boards so you see exactly the Pins you want—sometimes you just don't want to see anything else in your feed. So we added an easy way for you to stop getting these recommendations. Just head over to your settings and turn off your “Picked for you” setting, and we'll stop showing Picked for you Pins in your home feed. All of these updates were possible because of the helpful feedback we got from our Pinners.

But when you’re looking for something with more than one possible answer (“what should we make for dinner?”), they aren’t nearly as helpful. That’s what Pinterest’s idea search is all about: helping you find the right ideas for you. Just type in “kid party ideas” and find your way to the perfect theme, invite, favors, decorations and cake. Every month, people do more than 2 billion searches on Pinterest to find ideas that match their own unique tastes and circumstances. Building idea search is a whole new technological challenge, and to make it work, we’ve had to come up with new ways to build our search tools. Here’s just a few of the things we’ve been building that make Pinterest’s idea search so different. The most insightful recommendation tool ever built We’re building the world’s catalog of ideas, and over 100 million people around the world have already saved 75 billion ideas here. So unlike regular search engines, which are powered by robots, Pinterest is powered by people and the ideas they hand select. With so many millions of overlapping tastes and interests to draw on, Pinterest has the best “people who love X, also love Y” ideas you’ll find anywhere. Guides that point to the best ideas people have found Two years ago, we launched search guides, which help you figure out where to take your search next. Search guides are powered by all the other searches people have tried, which can be really helpful for those times when you don’t know the exact name of what you’re looking for. Search with pictures, not words Last November, we introduced our crazy-fun visual search tool, which lets you zoom in on any part of a Pin’s image to search and explore the products, colors or patterns you see there. So if you find a living room Pin with a couch you want to make your own, now you can search within the image to find visually similar Pins at different price points. People are loving the new visual search tool. There are already 130 million visual searches on Pinterest every month, with furniture, home decor and style ideas being the most popular things people are searching for—here’s a sampling of Pins with most visual searches. Local results, delivered fast Thanks to all the improvements we’ve been making to local search results and how fast things work behind the scenes, today people around the world are 3 times more likely to see local ideas in search results and related Pins than they were just a year ago. And those search results now come up twice as fast, so now everyone can instantly discover the ideas they’re most interested in. We’ve also been experimenting with exciting new ways to make idea search even more useful and fun to play with—keep your eyes peeled for more idea search announcements soon! --Naveen Gavini, Engineering manager, currently saving recipe ideas to his Cook board"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/the-pinterest-save-button-goes-global","date":"2016-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company","News","Product","Technology"],"title":"The Pinterest Save button goes global","text":"Pinterest has always been the save button for the internet, and today we’re making it official. Now when you go to save ideas, you’ll see the “Pin it” button says “Save.” It’s a small word change, but it’s such a huge part of the Pinterest experience, we wanted to let you know a bit more about the thinking behind it. “Save” makes more sense worldwide Now that more than half of people who use Pinterest are from outside the United States, we’ve been working harder than ever to make sure our app and website are easy to use no matter where you live or what language you speak. Unfortunately it turns out that the notion of “Pinning” ideas doesn’t always resonate with everyone around the world. So we decided to test what would happen if we swapped our Pin It button for the more utilitarian Save instead. We were amazed by just how many new Pinners started saving ideas on Pinterest, especially people from outside the US. In spite of the impressive numbers, we still really struggled with the decision to make the change. We have a lot of love for our Pin It button, which has served us well for so long. But the most important thing is for Pinterest to feel welcoming to everyone, and that’s why ultimately we went with the more understandable Save. Why we’re so happy about more people saving Having more people around the world saving ideas to Pinterest is great for everyone, because it means a wider and richer selection of Pins to explore—more authentic Japanese recipes, more French street styles, more Scandinavian parenting hacks. Also the more people who save ideas on Pinterest, the more people there are going out to try those ideas in their lives. And really, that’s what Pinterest is all about: Helping people discover and do things they love. It’s also easier to find more ideas to save Along with our new Save button, we’ve also improved the Pins themselves. Now you can see all the boards people have saved the Pin to across Pinterest, giving you even more places to find fresh ideas.

We’re lucky enough to have over 100 million Pinners around the world coming to Pinterest to find ideas to try. With so many people using our app, it’s more important than ever to make sure it works great for everyone—no matter where you live, what language you speak or how old your phone is. So we decided to give things a complete overhaul, from what our app looks like to how fast it works. Here’s what’s new: A new modern look that lets you focus more on Pins. Universally readable, in 31 languages. Kanji, Roman, Cyrillic—now our app is legible no matter what language you read or what screen size you have. Crazy fast loading, for everyone in the world. When you open the app, your home feed now loads up to 3 times faster. These changes have laid the groundwork for future improvements, too. Now that we’ve rebuilt things in a smarter way, engineers and designers here at Pinterest will be able to develop features faster than ever before. Because this was such a huge effort, we’re starting to roll out these updates on iPhone and iPad first. Make sure to update your app so you have the latest, greatest. Android and web are next on our list to tackle, so keep your eye out for updates in the coming months. To make sure you have the latest and greatest, update your iPhone app. (Android coming soon!) – Adam Barton, currently Pinning to 4899 Design"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/try-it-yourself-with-how-to-pins","date":"2016-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"Try it yourself with how-to Pins","text":"One of the main reasons people come to Pinterest is to find ideas they’re excited to try for the first time. In fact, 75% of people say Pinterest is the best place to find new interests, and 67% said it’s the place they come to express creativity. Today we’re introducing how-to Pins—so you can see at a glance what a Pin might be like to try. The next time you find an interesting project or idea on Pinterest, you’ll see a snapshot of the steps right below the Pin image. You can also click or tap on any of the steps to get the full instructions and a list of supplies—without ever leaving Pinterest. You’ll start to see how-to Pins from creative lifestyle experts like Brit & Co, hair and beauty pros like Style Me Pretty, fitness buffs like Greatist, cooking enthusiasts like Food.com, and DIYers like The Home Depot and eHow. If you’re in France, Germany or the UK, you’ll find how-to Pins from the Aufeminin-Group (France, Germany, UK), DaWanda, EatSmarter, Marie Claire Idées, Marmiton and Springlane.

But it isn’t always as easy as it should be to find those Pins later. Sometimes you forget what board a Pin’s on, even when you just Pinned it. We know how frustrating it can be when ideas you save get lost in the depths of your profile. So we’ve made some improvements to help you find and sort your Pins in a more intuitive way. Recent Pins are right up top We’ve noticed people tend to search for Pins they’ve added in the last month, so we’ve made it super easy to get right to your most recent Pins. Browse your Pins by topic Once you have enough Pins, your profile will start showing you the topics you Pin about most, giving you a glimpse of the kinds of colors, cuisines, designers and other stuff you’re into these days. Just tap to see all the Pins you saved for each topic. You’ll see topic filters for all your Pins and individual boards. So if you’ve saved a ton of Pins to your Healthy Eats board, now you can get cooking faster by filtering your recipes by \"salad\" \"avocado\" and more. Quickly find specific boards and Pins You can view your boards by when you Pinned to them last, or alphabetically. Or just do a quick search to find a specific board or Pin.

Well, now we’ve got a new tool that lets you find all those things you don't have the words to describe. When you spot something in a Pin that you want to learn more about, tap the search tool in the corner. Then select the part of the Pin you’re interested in, and we’ll show you Pins just like it.

Now that there are all these international Pins to discover, we wanted to make it easy for locals to find the best Pins being saved in their own country. So we’ve made some improvements to how search works wherever people use Pinterest. Search results that speak your language Pinterest Search results are now customized by language and country, to help international Pinners find local Pins that are more familiar and relevant to them. So now if someone in Germany searches for cake-baking ideas, they'll find all the best local Pins about baking, frosting and decorating cakes—and both the Pin descriptions and the sites the Pins link to will be in German. Also as of today, spell-check and search suggestions will be available for Pinners who search in French, German, Japanese and Portuguese. So far, so good! Based on what we’ve seen so far, these new improvements are already helping our international Pinners find what exactly they’re looking for. Across Brazil, France, Germany and Japan, people are finding and Pinning twice as many local Pins when they search.

Back in 2013, one of our engineers Tracy Chou kicked off the “where are the numbers?” initiative, which revealed just how low the numbers really were. Now that companies are regularly reporting their data, it’s clear not a lot of progress has been made since then. We think one reason it’s been so hard to get numbers to change is that companies haven’t stated specific goals. So today, we’re doing something unprecedented—we’re going on record with our hiring goals for 2016. We’re also sharing details about the new programs and improvements we have planned. Where we are now We've made some modest progress over the past year, with our number of female employees growing from 40% to 42%, engineering interns increasing from 32% to 36% female, and women engineers hired out of school increasing from 28% to 33%. But we have more work to do to increase the number of employees from all underrepresented backgrounds, which is why we’re setting goals and taking the steps below. Our goals for 2016 Increase hiring rates for full-time engineering roles to 30% female. Increase hiring rates for full-time engineers to 8% underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. Increase hiring rates for non-engineering roles to 12% underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. Implement a Rooney Rule-type requirement where at least one person from an underrepresented background and one female candidate is interviewed for every open leadership position. How we plan to get there Expand the set of universities we recruit from, and launch an early identification intern program for freshman and sophomore students from underrepresented backgrounds. Work with outside strategy firm Paradigm to set up Inclusion Labs at Pinterest, where we’ll experiment with new ways to improve diversity. Have every employee participate in training to prevent unconscious bias. Support the creation of a training and mentorship program to maximize the impact of Black software engineers and students, led by one of our engineers. By sharing these goals publicly, we’re holding ourselves accountable to make meaningful changes to how we approach diversity at Pinterest. We’ll also be sharing what’s working and what isn’t as we go, so hopefully other companies can learn along with us. Over time, we hope to help build an industry that is truly diverse, and by extension more inclusive, creative and effective. *Gender data is global and ethnicity data is U.S. only. All data includes hires starting through September 2015. This is not based on EEO-1 reports; however, ethnicity refers to the EEO-1 categories which we know are imperfect categorizations of race and ethnicity, but reflect the U.S. government reporting requirements. **Other includes American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. ***Tech includes Engineering, Product Management, and Product Design.

Earlier this month, we announced buyable Pins—the simple, secure way to buy your favorite products on Pinterest. Today, we’re excited to start rolling them out to U.S. Pinners on iPhone and iPad. Here’s a quick look at how everything works. Blue means you can buy You’ll start seeing buyable Pins all over Pinterest—in your home feed, on boards you love, and in search results. When you spot a Pin with a blue price, that means you can buy it. Say you’re on the hunt for a new jacket. Try a search, then swipe through all the buyable Pins at the top of your search results.

We’ve made a couple improvements to how search works, so now it’s even easier for you to find the creative ideas and people you’re looking for. Streamlined search suggestions Before when you did a search, your results were buried behind different filters for Pins, Pinners and boards. Now you see all the closest matching options the second you start typing. Notable people and brands are marked with check mark, so if you’re looking for celebrity chef Alton Brown, you can find Pins of his recipes or follow Alton himself to keep up with his latest Pins. Once you tap into your results, you can use the new filter button to switch between seeing boards, Pinners, Pins or just your Pins. See what’s trending When you first tap into search, you see the top trending searches (US only for now), to give you a glimpse of what creative new ideas are popping up today. Spellcheck? Check! About 12% of all searches on Pinterest include a spelling error, which can make for some disappointing results. But now, if you mistakenly thumb something in that doesn’t sound quite right, we’ll show results for what we think you’re looking for. That way you see better results, and you don’t have to waste time re-thumbing in your search. We’ve been testing out these improvements, and we’re noticing over two times as many searchers are finding the brands, people and boards they want to follow. Try doing a search of your own—we think you’ll like what you find! —Sarah Tavel, Product Manager, currently Pinning to Animated GIFs That Will Come in Handy"},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/more-gender-options-on-pinterest","date":"2015-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product"],"title":"More gender options on Pinterest","text":"Pinterest is all about helping people discover and save creative ideas.

Lots of you have said that you’d like to buy the things you discover on Pinterest, too. Like @RebeccaStrebe who Tweeted, “It would be so great if Pinterest would let you buy all the clothes you Pinned #lifewouldbegr8\" and @Brookecomans who said, “I wish there was a straight up buy button on Pinterest.” Well, we’re excited to let you in on some good news! In a few weeks, we’ll be introducing buyable Pins—just another way to bring the creative ideas you find on Pinterest to life. Here’s how it all works. Blue means you can buy When you spot a Pin with a blue price, you’ll know you can buy it right from the app. Searching for something specific? Use the price filter to hone in on just the right Pin. You can also find the right color for you, within the Pin itself. See how you feel about the orange sleeping bag, or maybe the black one. Swipe through all your options and pick your favorite. It’s simple and secure When you’re ready to check out, tap Buy it and pay with Apple Pay or a credit card. Soon, you’ll be on your way and back to Pinning. Once you enter your personal info, we’ll store it so you don’t have to thumb it in again next time. The fewer people who have access your credit card information, the better—and that includes us. That’s why we won’t store your credit card info ourselves. Instead, we’re working with payment processors who’ve been protecting people’s information for years. And when you pay with Apple Pay, it uses a device specific account number instead of your actual credit card number, so neither your device nor Apple Pay will send your actual card number to the seller. Shop millions of hand-picked products You'll find millions of buyable Pins on Pinterest, from great brands like Macy’s, Neiman Marcus andNordstrom, retailers powered by Demandware like Cole Haan and Michaels, and thousands ofShopify stores like Poler Outdoor Stuff and SOBU. If you want to learn more about buyable Pins for your business, visit our business blog. Coming soon! If you’re in the U.S., you’ll see buyable Pins on your iPhone or iPad in a few weeks. If you’re on Android or using your desktop, you’ll see them in future releases. We can’t wait to see all the creative things you do with buyable Pins.

Since then, a growing group of businesses in the U.S. have been paying to give their Pins more visibility in search results and category feeds. Now, we’re testing ads in different places, including the home feed, for U.S. Pinners. Your home feed is the first thing you see when you come to Pinterest, so we want to make sure you’re always welcomed with Pins that are beautiful, relevant and tasteful—and that includes Promoted Pins. Of course, if you don’t like a Promoted Pin, you can always hide it from your feed and tell us why you didn’t like it. We’ll use your feedback to improve what you see in the future. Promoted Pins are just like regular Pins—the only difference is that a business paid to have more people see it. These Pins will always be labeled “Promoted” so they’re easy to spot. We’ve seen Pinners save Promoted Pins to their boards of wish lists, inspirations and interests—just like other Pins they discover. Recently, I was looking to redo my bedroom, and I found a rug in the Home Décorcategory on Pinterest that’s just my style. It happened to be a Promoted Pin from Target. That’s exactly what we’re hoping Promoted Pins can be: one more way to discover and save creative ideas, connecting you to businesses that’ll help you make your plans a reality. We want to make sure Pinterest is a service that’s here to stay for all of us, and advertising helps us ensure that happens. As always, we’re listening to any feedback you have about how Pinterest is doing, so let us know what you think. —Annie Ta, Product Manager, currently Pinning to Dream Home."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/search-is-getting-smarter","date":"2014-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product"],"title":"Search is getting smarter!","text":"We want to give you a quick look at some of the improvements we’ve been making behind the scenes to the results you see in Guided Search. If you do a lot of searching on Pinterest, you may already have noticed the results you’re seeing are better than ever. For example, say you’re looking for a new watch. Before when you searched Pinterest for “watches,” your results would include mostly women’s timepieces. But now, men will see Pins and guides inspired by what other guys have Pinned, and everybody’s results should feel a lot closer to what they’re looking for. Of course if you ever want results for another gender, like if you’re shopping for a gift for someone else, you can always use the guides to fine-tune your search. These customized search results appear for thousands of different search terms. The next time you’re on Pinterest, try searching for hair, shoes or health and see for yourself how spot on your results are. (Not getting the results you’re looking for? Make sure you’ve selected your preferred gender in your settings.) And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We’ve got lots more improvements coming your way.

We hope your holidays have been merry and bright, and that you’re fully recovered from all the holiday cheering. Here at Pinterest, we’ve decided to try something a little different this New Years. Instead of making the same old list of resolutions, we’re pinning creative ideas we’ve always wanted to try instead: Like our PR specialist Mithya. She’s going to try different coffee spots around San Francisco. And one of our founders, Evan, is planning to build a photo wall at home. We’d love for you to join us! All you have to do is: Step 1: Pin the year you want! Make your own “To Try in 2015” board and fill it with ideas you’ve always wanted to try—from little things (grow your own salad bar) to big life-changers (Antarctica, anyone?). And since the ideas you Pin are all visual, it’s easy to picture yourself doing them. If you need some inspiration, take a look at what resolutionaries like Chef Emeril and globe-trotter Trey are trying this year over in our Ideas for 2015 Pin Picks . Step 2: Share your board with friends Studies show that when you tell friends about your plans, you’re more likely to do them. So try sharing your board on Facebook or Twitter, along with the hashtag #PinYourYear. You can even tag friends who might be able to help, or even challenge them to try something a little different this year, too. Step 3: Try the things you’ve Pinned throughout the year When you’re ready to give a Pin a try, the info you need is always right at hand—just click to see the site the Pin came from. And even if things don’t go exactly as planned the first time you try it, don’t worry about it.

He’s cooked for President Obama, opened his dream restaurant in Harlem and is a mentor on ABC’s The Taste. Samuelsson tells us about his path from Sweden, where he learned to cook from his grandmother Helga, to New York City and his latest cookbook, Marcus Off Duty, a four year journey of learning, living, tasting and cooking, with 150 recipes he cooks at home with his wife Maya on a quiet night in. When did your passion for cooking start? I’ve enjoyed cooking since I was young. My grandmother Helga was my greatest influence and I owe a lot of my success to her. She didn’t just teach me how to cook, but to cook seasonally, with a spiritual compass, and with traditions and values that I would use my entire life. My sisters and I were always encouraged to help and do the work, not just watch. When I was a teenager, I went to a local culinary school in Sweden and realized I was really good at cooking. When you find pride and confidence in yourself and what you do, there’s no better time to develop that passion. And it was hard work. I struggled a lot because I was different. I had to prove myself over and over again. You attended top cooking schools in Sweden and apprenticed in Switzerland, Austria and France. What was the biggest lesson you learned? I learned some of the most important life lessons in those kitchens. Whether I was plucking feathers off a duck or making dinner for the chef’s dog, I worked as hard as I could. Working in kitchens is a lot like being on a sports team. You rely on each other so much and become as close as family. There’s no pressure like the pressure of not wanting to let down your family, team or kitchen. After only a year apprenticing at Aquavit, you became Executive Chef. Then The New York Times awarded you two three-star ratings. At the time, you were the youngest chef to have achieved that. How did this affect your career? I owe it all to hard work, timing and my amazing team who believed in me. So many doors were opened after that. And this was long before chefs were seen the way they are now—the inner circle of top chefs was small. But as soon as that happened, I was in, and made friends with people who will be my friends forever. You cooked for President Obama—what was it like being guest chef for the first state dinner? That was one of the most nervous days of my life. I met the president and first lady, and have since seen and cooked for them several times, but there is no greater intimidation than the first. Usually state dinners are French. But I wanted to create something that would be familiar to their guest, the prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh. I did a lot of research and used inspiration from both American and Indian cuisines so everyone felt at home. The prime minister was also vegetarian, so there were lentils, cornbread, chutneys and sweet potatoes. It was the ultimate, albeit refined, mashup. You’re no stranger to TV. You won Top Chef Masters in 2010, judged Top Chef, Iron Chef America, Chopped and most recently ABC’s The Taste, plus guest appearances on Today and Good Morning America(opens in a new window). How do you stay fresh? I go out to eat, read and experiment often. The food world changes so quickly. You have to stay informed and try new things to be successful. Of all the things you’ve done in the last four years, what’s your most memorable moment? Opening my restaurant Red Rooster. Everyone wants to be their own boss, but what really drove me was Harlem. I love the neighborhood I live in and want to share it with people who might not otherwise venture about 110th Street. There’s so much to share here—and it’s more than a restaurant. We are a pillar in the community, a meeting place, gallery, music venue, place of employment, and we just so happen to serve delicious food, too."},{"platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/grow-your-mo-for-movember","date":"2014-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"Grow your Mo for Movember","text":"Handlebar or horseshoe—it all depends on your personal moustache mojo.

What’s with the whiskers? Pinployee Derrick Diaz(opens in a new window) was hoping you’d ask… How’d you first become a Mo Bro? It was 2009 at my old job in New York City. People were really into it and one year, whoever bid the most got to pick the color someone else had to dye their moustache—it got pretty competitive. I’ve raised $60,000 since then. What was the inspiration for your Mo this year? This is a classic handlebar—very Hulk Hogan-esque(opens in a new window). I wanted something that didn’t fit my face so people would ask me about it. I searched for “ men’s moustache shaping(opens in a new window)” on Pinterest and found good stuff that way. Does your wife dig it? She hates it! She thinks I look like Spencer Pratt with the blond growing in. She’ll say stuff like “I don’t know if i can kiss you…it’s terrible!” Any tips for Mo maintenance? My first year I treated myself to a warm shave from a barber, but now I can handle it myself. The best way to groom is with a comb and high-quality hair cutting scissors—not with a beard trimmer since you don’t have as much control. Who’s your moustache hero? Tom Selleck(opens in a new window). His is dark, full, and he has the perfect upper lip. Sometimes my moustache makes me feel like I’m a 14 year-old kid who’s trying to be like my dad (who also had the Tom Selleck). It just doesn’t have the oomph. I blame the blond.

Perhaps you’ve picked up one of his twelve books, or bought his exclusive line of tools from HSN. With a career spanning more than three decades, Bob Vila(opens in a new window) is the most well known and trusted authorities in home improvement, and has spent his career helping people improve their homes and their lives. Here, he talks about his first job, inspirations and lessons learned. Plus, find out how he preps for winter, his favorite home hack and the tool he can’t live without. In one sentence, I am… Crazy about my granddaughters, but still in love with my career. When I’m not working, I love to… Travel, garden and be on or in the ocean. My biggest vice is… French Cabernet wine. When I was a kid, I loved… The beach and dessert. My first job was… At a book bindery. And before my career in broadcasting, I spent time building houses in Panama as a Peace Corps volunteer. The reason I started doing what I do is… It’s in the blood—my dad built houses, his mom did too and so does my son! The biggest lesson I’ve learned (so far)… Don’t stop, but look back every once in a while. My motto is… You can’t always get what you want, but if you try, you’ll find you get what you need. Five things I’ll do to prepare for winter… 1-2. Go through an energy saving checklist from thermostats(opens in a new window) and furnace filters(opens in a new window) to insulation(opens in a new window). Then book flights south. 3. Fill the new Victory Garden composter(opens in a new window) and make plans for next year’s gardens. 4. Spray foam any cellar cracks, and check weatherstripping and caulk(opens in a new window) to prevent chilly mice from coming in. 5. Find rotted wood house parts and fix them or get them fixed for you. Two easy home upgrades that take five minutes… Change your switch plate(opens in a new window) cover. Add a wall decal(opens in a new window). My favorite home improvement hacks are… Vinegar(opens in a new window) can be used to clean just about anything, plus it’s affordable and non-toxic. Use a Post-It note(opens in a new window) to make drilling into a wall cleaner. A recent home improvement project I did was… Turning the outgrown kids’ playhouse(opens in a new window) into a garden shed(opens in a new window). The tools I could never live without… 16-ounce claw hammer(opens in a new window) and 25-foot tape. The one thing that will be definitely be in my 2014 Holiday Gift Guide… New cordless tools.(opens in a new window) For more home improvement how-to and room-by-room DIY projects, see Pin Picks(opens in a new window) from Bob, HGTV and DIY Network.
