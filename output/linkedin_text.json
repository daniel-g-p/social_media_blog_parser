It’s getting harder for them to demonstrate the impact of their campaigns on revenue, given the long, group-based nature of the B2B purchase cycle.

We partnered with YouGov to survey C-level leaders and senior B2B marketers from across the globe and found that: Over three-quarters (78%) believe companies that maintain or increase marketing spend during periods of uncertainty recover faster Majority (90%) of marketers say improving CFO understanding of ROI is key to bolstering future budgets The majority (77%) of CMOs globally feel under pressure to prove greater short-term ROI on their marketing campaigns To stay top of mind, B2B marketers are keen to continue focusing on brand building, with more than two-thirds (67%) planning to maintain or increase spend in this area over the next six months To help marketers meet the moment with confidence, we’re announcing new tools that will enable them to continue to authentically reach their audiences and measure and map their work to business impact.

Nevertheless, the beginning of a new fiscal year affords us the opportunity to reflect on how we’re doing and take stock of the pace of progress. Two years ago, like many companies, we took a look at our organization and determined that our reality did not match our aspirations. While we had conviction that diversifying LinkedIn was critical, we also knew that we had to do more and move faster, and that we needed to take a systemic approach in order to make sustainable progress. As we exit our 2022 fiscal year, we are on a different trajectory. This year brought the most rapid increase in diversity that our workforce has ever experienced – especially at senior and leadership levels. Our focus on building an environment of belonging across employee communities is evolving and maturing. And we’re seeing results not just through hiring, but also in retention and sentiment within underrepresented communities. We’re energized by our momentum, but we are far from satisfied. Our aspirations are to build a world-class inclusive and equitable organization that represents our communities and sets an example across the professional landscape. While our journey continues, we enter our 2023 fiscal year with a sense of optimism for the powerful future we unlock as we move towards a more diverse and inclusive organization. Beginning with an environment of belonging Our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging at LinkedIn is first and foremost a commitment to creating an inclusive environment for all employees, regardless of their social identity. The foundation of this work is our Environment of Belonging strategy, which is built intentionally to operate across a wide range of communities. In its second full year, our Inclusive Leadership for Managers initiative reached over three quarters of our manager population, and grew through additional learning paths to support managers’ leadership journeys, from hiring practices to team culture. Programs like Allyship Academy, Inclusive Practices for Individual Contributors, and team Conversation Guides equip employees to build trust across dimensions of difference including sexual orientation, ability, gender identity, and religion. We also partner with organizations like OutLeadership, GiftAbled, Coqual and Tanenbaum to inform our strategy and support our workforce. Further, our ten Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) play a vital role in creating community and belonging for employees with shared identities and their allies. We support ERG leaders developmentally through programs like the Collaborate, Empower, Own (C.E.O.) leadership program and executive coaching, and we reward them financially through our industry-leading Distinguish program. Diversifying the company and our leadership Building and nurturing diverse teams is one of our top priorities, with an emphasis on employee groups that are underrepresented in our workforce. We’ve been especially focused on diversifying our leadership in order to strengthen our organizational decision-making and to instill employee confidence that paths to advancement are available to all. Two years ago, we pledged to double the population of senior U.S. Black and Latino employees (leaders, managers, and senior individual contributors) by fiscal year 2025. We’re thrilled to share that we’ve already hit this milestone for Black employees, growing the Black senior population by 127%, and we’re well on our way for senior Latino employees, growing that population by 74%. During the same period, our total U.S. population at those senior levels grew by 34%. From a gender perspective, women now represent over 45% of our global leadership population (Director+), up 8% from last year. This progress is also reflected in our employee representation trends at all levels. Black employee representation is up over 50% in a single year, to 7.2%, while Latino representation is up 17% to 7.4%. Representation of women in technical roles is up 11% to 27.8%, and our global employee base is now 47% women. Prioritizing growth and development Employee retention is critical to a sustainable diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy, and for many, retention is closely linked to career development. We’ve placed deliberate focus here for years, and for the first time, we see no gaps in attrition rates for US Black and Latino employees or global women in leadership and technical roles relative to our overall averages. Through a focus on leadership support via initiatives like our global ImpactIn Mentorship Program, DIBs Mentor Circles, and spectrum of sponsorship leadership learning initiatives, employees from under-represented groups now report higher rates of mentorship and sponsorship than our overall employee averages. Programs like the Asian American and Pacific Islander Invest program bring a tailored approach to community building and development investments. We also focus on equity within our talent systems and processes, by providing comprehensive compensation education to managers and actively managing pay equity, as well as putting measures in place to promote equitable visibility of talent in promotion and succession processes. As our leadership team has become more diverse, we’re noticing improvements in employee confidence in their ability to grow their careers at LinkedIn via our Employee Voice Survey. Our work in growth and development has been strengthened by partnerships with organizations with a shared vision for inclusion in corporate spaces. We’ve partnered with organizations like Lesbians who Tech in the U.S., The Diversity Practice in Europe, and Shenomics in Asia Pacific to create development opportunities for employee communities around the globe. Diversifying through hiring Inclusive recruiting practices play an essential role in advancing our DIBs strategy and achieving measurable results in hiring and representation. LinkedIn takes a holistic view of diversity that includes a deep understanding of the unique nuance of regions across the globe. This view may include race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, diverse abilities, and veteran status amongst the many dimensions of diversity on which we focus. We’ve built and continue to anchor on a strategy that emphasizes embedding an inclusive lens at every stage of the process, including systems, programs, and behaviors that, when taken together, lead to better hires that strengthen our organization. This work begins with an intentional approach to build communities of talent that will diversify LinkedIn through diverse pipelines, networks, and relationships with candidates from backgrounds underrepresented in our offices around the globe. Partnerships play a critical role in helping us build & nurture these networks of talent. We work with over 50 strategic partners, who share our focus on creating diverse and inclusive workplaces around the globe. Organizations like Blavity, Anita B.Org, Management Leadership for Tomorrow, Disability In, Black Tech Fest, The Future Skills Programme, CareerTrackers, and others have helped us reach and nurture a diverse pool of candidates. Beyond connecting to communities outside of LinkedIn, we’ve worked to create systematic approaches to our candidate funnel and hiring processes to ensure greater consistency in progressing a diverse set of candidates to on-site interviews and to mitigate bias within the decision-making process. By fostering the equitable conditions and inclusive behaviors that allow qualified candidates from a diverse set of backgrounds to enter, advance, and succeed in our hiring processes, we’re able to move the needle on diversity steadily over time. Looking ahead Much of the energy behind our enduring commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at LinkedIn stems from our conviction that LinkedIn’s platform plays a critical role in creating equitable opportunities for our hundreds of millions of members – and the billions of potential members. We’ve ramped up our investments in equity across our platform with key initiatives like the launch of Top Voices in Racial Equity to Follow, the release of the our B2B Institute’s Equity Everyday Research, Diversity Nudges in LinkedIn Recruiter, and more than 10 million members joining us on our Equity journey by completing Self-ID. Creating equitable impact at scale is an imperative embedded within our company vision–to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. While we are pleased with the direction of our progress over the past two years in particular, we recognize that this journey is incredibly nuanced and progress can be uneven. We enter our 2023 fiscal year during a period of geopolitical tension and macroeconomic uncertainty. But our commitment to DIBs and Equity is a constant force within our company, embedded explicitly within our company values, and regarded as a priority requiring relentless, continuous improvement. We move forward with humility in that knowledge, but also excitement at the ways in which a more diverse and inclusive workforce will bolster the next phase of our company’s growth in pursuit of our vision.

Find qualified internal candidates for open jobs with a new spotlight for internal candidates in LinkedIn Recruiter. Help employees find open jobs at their company aligned to their career goals within LinkedIn Learning Hub, a skill-building platform they’re already using for professional growth. Equip employees to take career development into their own hands. A new level of personalization in LinkedIn Learning Hub gives employees the ability to specify their career goals and receive tailored learning recommendations. Employees can pinpoint their skill strengths and gaps using our new Skill Evaluation feature. Career pathing with new Role Guides gives employees a better understanding of the skills they need for specific roles. Hire the right people based on what matters to them. A new Commitments feature on Company Pages lets organizations highlight the specific commitments they’ve made in five key areas: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI); Environmental Sustainability; Social Impact; Career Growth and Learning; and Work-Life Balance. This will help employers showcase their company culture, and attract qualified candidates who are looking to assess if a company might be a good fit. Insights from our new Global Talent Trends Report include: Globally, hiring is leveling off after historic highs. Workers are bracing for an economic downturn, with job candidates’ and employees’ confidence in their ability to improve their financial situation low. Candidates’ top priorities when evaluating roles are compensation, work-life balance, flexible-work arrangements, and upskilling. Candidates increasingly want remote work, even as employers scale back on remote job postings. Internal mobility increases retention: employees who made an internal move have a 75% chance of staying at their company after two years, compared to 56% for employees who haven’t.

Here is what’s new: Expanding Audio Event Access to Even More Creators: Earlier this year, we started beta testing a new event experience that gave creators the ability to host an interactive audio discussion with their audiences - and it was a total success! We saw creators connecting with their communities by hosting office hours and AMA’s, networking events, conversations with thought leaders, and more. Now, we’re expanding Audio Event hosting access to anyone who has Creator Mode turned on and meets our community policies of being a trustworthy, safe, and professional provider of content. And as before, if you don’t have hosting access, you can still join an audio event and raise your hand to join the conversation. Highlighting a URL In Your Profile Header: We heard from many creators that increasing visibility for a personal website, event, or portfolio is a priority. With creator mode, you can now add a link to the top of your profile so that audiences can learn more about you and your brand. We’ve improved how people can discover and follow creators: Gain followers from sites outside of LinkedIn: In the coming weeks, Creator Mode will provide a link/button that you can share or embed on other websites, emails, and blogs. With just one click, users on other platforms can follow you on LinkedIn. They’ll get to see more of your public LinkedIn content, and you can quickly grow your following. More ways to gain followers in the Feed: We’ve continued to improve how your content shows up in member feeds - whether those people already follow you or not. To ensure folks will continue to see your content, we’ve made it even easier to follow you right from the Feed without needing to visit your profile. Keep developing high-quality content to show up in feeds and attract new followers! Easier to be discovered in search: 18% of all follows on LinkedIn come from LinkedIn search – that’s why we’ve made a number of improvements to how creators like you will show up in search results. Now, if someone searches for a specific person, we’ve made it easy to one-click follow them without needing to leave the search experience.

While we have agreed to settle this matter, we do not agree with the government’s claims; LinkedIn pays and has paid its employees fairly and equitably when comparing similar work. In 2021 we conducted an ‘equal pay analysis’ and found that globally, for every $1.00 earned by men, our female employees earn $0.999. In the US, our employees of color earn $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by our white employees. We recognize that pay equity requires continuous attention and investment. We use local and function-based competitive market data to develop pay ranges and guidance to ensure fair and consistent pay across different groups within the same jobs, levels, and regions. As part of our annual review cycles, we review our employees’ pay compared to the ranges and to their peers, and we make adjustments as appropriate.

Skills-first hiring is gaining traction. 40% of hirers now use skills data when hiring on LinkedIn, up 20% compared to a year prior.

The 2022 Global Green Skills Report shines a light on how and where people are contributing to the transition to a green economy, where gaps are emerging, and what policymakers, companies and individuals can do to help fight the climate crisis. The Global Green Skills Report comes at a time when the global economy, and the world is experiencing a Great Reshuffle, a historic transformation in how people work, where they work, and even why they work. In parallel, the world faces the urgent need to transition to a green economy to address the threat of climate change. The Global Green Skills Report will officially launch in Brussels today (4 p.m. CEST/ 7 a.m. PST), with the event broadcast on LinkedIn Live. Joining the discussion with Sue Duke, Head of Global Public Policy at LinkedIn, is Mariya Gabriel, EU Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth. “The scale of change required to achieve a green economy and meet ambitious EU and global climate change targets, means we need to think about sustainable skills in all jobs and all sectors,” said Sue Duke, Head of Global Public Policy at LinkedIn. “LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report provides actionable insights that can be a catalyst for the jobs and skill transformations, which are vital for building the next generation of green talent. We applaud EU Commissioner Mariya Gabriel’s work to put green skills on the top of the agenda, and LinkedIn will play our part to realise the EU’s ambition to provide Europe’s youth with a clean and green future.” Key insights from the report: Green talent rising: green talent increased from 9.6% in 2015 to 13.3% in 2021 - a cumulative growth rate of 38.5%.

Transferable skills: traditional fashion jobs, such as fashion designers, stylists and merchandisers, are increasingly applying sustainable fashion skills. Workers skilled in sustainable fashion are also active across many other industries, e.g. media and communications, design, arts, manufacturing, corporate services, non-profit organisations, software and IT services. Greening roles: the fastest-growing greening roles were compliance manager (19%), facilities manager (11%) and technical sales representative (8%).

With this launch, LinkedIn aims to break down language barriers, providing greater access to professional and networking opportunities to Hindi speakers in India and around the world. With the launch of Hindi, LinkedIn now supports 25 languages globally. Starting today, as part of the Phase 1 roll-out of LinkedIn in Hindi, members will be able to access their feed, profile, jobs, messaging, and create content in Hindi on desktop, and on their Android and iOS phones. As the next step, LinkedIn will work towards widening the range of job opportunities available for Hindi speaking professionals across industries, including more banking, and government jobs. The platform will also continue to add more Hindi publishers and creators in the coming weeks to boost member engagement and conversations in Hindi. India is a core market for growth at LinkedIn and the second largest market in terms of members after the US, accounting for 82 million members as part of a global community of 800 million members. India’s member base has grown by 20+ million in the past three years (15% year-over-year growth) and it has witnessed a spike in engagement and conversations on the platform since the pandemic. “In India, LinkedIn has been mission critical to helping people connect, learn, grow and get hired during the pandemic and in this new world of work we are in. With the launch of Hindi, now more members and customers can unlock greater value from the platform through content, jobs, and networking, and express themselves in a language that they feel comfortable in. We have witnessed high engagement and member growth in the last year, and it is at this exciting inflection point that we are strengthening our vision to create economic opportunity for ‘every’ member of the workforce, and taking down language barriers for Hindi speakers across the world,” says Ashutosh Gupta, India Country Manager, LinkedIn. How to use LinkedIn, and set up your profile, in Hindi Smartphone users will need to select Hindi as their preferred device language under phone settings to view the LinkedIn mobile application in Hindi. For members who are already using Hindi as their preferred language on their smartphones, the LinkedIn experience will automatically be available in Hindi. On desktop, members will need to click on the ‘Me’ icon at the top of their LinkedIn homepage and select ‘Settings and Privacy’. Members then need to click on ‘Account Preferences’ on the left, select ‘Site Preferences’, click ‘Change’ next to ‘Language’, and select ‘Hindi’ from the drop down list. Once selected, the user interface and platform experience, including the navigation bar, will be displayed in Hindi, to help members quickly and easily locate features they are looking for. User-generated content, such as posts on a member’s home feed, will be displayed in the language that they were originally created in. However, for members whose primary language selection is set to Hindi, clicking on ‘See Translation’ option will display Hindi translations of the respective posts. If members are not already using a Hindi keyboard, to create Hindi content on LinkedIn, they will need to switch their keyboard input language to Hindi, or add the Hindi keyboard on their desktop or smartphone. With the launch of Hindi, members also have the advantage of creating their LinkedIn profile in Hindi, and make it easier for Hindi speaking members and recruiters to find them for relevant opportunities. New LinkedIn members can sign up for LinkedIn in Hindi by visiting LinkedIn.com and registering for a new account. Members with existing English profiles can add a second language profile in Hindi. Adding a second language profile is currently only available on Desktop. To create a second language profile, members will need to click on the “Me” icon, followed by “View Profile”, and then “Add profile in another language”. To display their existing profile in Hindi, members will need to create a secondary language profile in the same language as their existing profile. This will prompt them to choose a preferred language for their existing profile from a drop down list of 25 languages, which now includes Hindi. Creators and LinkedIn Influencers share their first Hindi posts with their networks The launch of LinkedIn in Hindi saw LinkedIn Influencers such as international life coach Gaur Gopal Das, monk-turned-entrepreneur Dr. Vivek Bindra, and nearbuy.com founder Ankur Warikoo share their first Hindi posts on their LinkedIn profiles. The launch of Hindi is part of LinkedIn's vision to become a more equitable platform, and to allow more diverse professional communities to unlock greater value from LinkedIn. Other global initiatives include Project Every Member and the LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit that build equality into LinkedIn’s products and remove systemic biases and barriers to opportunity. This is the Phase 1 roll-out of LinkedIn in Hindi, and the platform will evaluate member feedback and adoption to improve the member experience over the next few months.

LinkedIn in Hindi is now available to all members globally on Desktop and Android, and will gradually roll out to all iOS users in the coming days.

Included in the report on the financial performance were the following LinkedIn highlights: In Q1 FY22, LinkedIn’s revenue was up 42% year-over-year (39% in constant currency). We’re experiencing a Great Reshuffle across the global labor market as people are rethinking not only where and how they work, but why. With more people changing jobs than ever before, we saw record engagement as nearly 800 million members turned to LinkedIn to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. Confirmed hires on the platform also increased more than 160% year over year, and this quarter we launched new ways to help job seekers discover roles that align with how they want to work. In this rapidly evolving labor market, companies are increasingly turning to LinkedIn Learning to upskill and reskill their employees. We now have more than 15,000 enterprise customers, and we are expanding our opportunity in the creator economy, including offering new ways for LinkedIn Learning instructors to build their audiences and connect with learners live. Businesses continue to choose LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals, with our advertising revenue up 61% year over year.

We envision a workforce that reflects the communities we serve, and diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DIBs) remain our number one talent priority. Over the past 12 months we’ve made significant investments, and we’re seeing advances across our DIBS strategy globally. In this year’s workforce diversity report, we’re sharing an update on our progress with a mix of enthusiasm for the momentum we have established and deep humility in recognizing that we have more work to do. We’ve accelerated our work to create an environment of belonging across LinkedIn. This work is global in scope with a goal to build a consistent culture of inclusion that every employee at LinkedIn is responsible for driving. We partner with organizations that share our commitment to creating diverse and inclusive workplaces and offer invaluable expertise directly developing our talent strategy. Last year, we launched our inclusive leadership for managers initiative, reaching over three-quarters of our global manager population. We are now expanding on that foundation with additional learning paths for people managers and a growing portfolio of offerings for individual contributors (ICs). Last year, we made a public commitment to double the number of Black and Latino leaders, managers, and senior individual contributors in our U.S. workforce by FY25. After a strong FY21, we are proud to report that we’re pacing ahead of schedule on this commitment, growing the Black leader, manager, and senior IC population by 35.0%, and the equivalent Latino population by 20.3%. Our highest growth has been at the leadership level, where Black and Latino representation at the Director+ level have grown by 1.5 pp and 1.0 pp, respectively over the past year. More broadly, we’ve seen strong growth in representation at all levels, where U.S. Black employee representation grew by 1.0 pp and Latino representation by 0.6 pp. We have also placed an emphasis on gender diversity globally. We saw progress in the representation of women in technical roles, which grew at 1.3 pp this year. Our representation of women in leadership remained stable at 41.8% and will continue to be a global focus area in each of our three regions. Looking ahead, we will continue to build on the momentum we established in FY21 by focusing on our core strategic pillars — Environment of Belonging, Growth & Development, Inclusion Recruiting, and Strategic Partnerships. We also launched an Equity Strategy organization to help drive equal access and equitable outcomes in our products and platform experience. By continuing to invest in this forever work, we aim to create long-term, sustained progress that continues to help us evolve to where we aspire to be. Environment of Belonging Underpinning our strategy is a continued focus on the environment we create for every employee. Our priority is to ensure that our people managers provide inclusive leadership to their teams. This group—the people who most influence employee careers and the day-to-day working culture—is essential to our progress. Our approach is a holistic three-part strategy focused on expectations, education, and accountability. We began by setting a clear expectation that every manager globally must cultivate an inclusive leadership skill set to succeed at LinkedIn. Over 75% of people managers completed our Leading with Inclusion half-day learning event this year, which was offered in every global region, and we’re already seeing a positive impact on the teams of managers who have gone through the learning. Knowing that inclusive leadership is a lifelong pursuit, we will be rolling out new learning paths and engagement tools this year. Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are an important foundation for an environment of belonging, and we have invested in the 500+ ERG leaders who contribute their skills and energy to this goal. We not only see these employees as leaders in their ERG communities, but also as current and future leaders of LinkedIn’s business. This year we introduced Distinguish, a program to recognize the contributions of our global ERG co-chairs through financial awards and other forms of recognition. This program is part of a broader strategy that includes investing in leadership and business strategy skills for our global ERG leaders through our C.E.O. leadership program. Beyond these initiatives, our environment of belonging strategy includes Allyship Academy, efforts centered around people with disabilities, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and executive and leadership engagement. [Learn more about this work here] Growth & Development The core to sustaining an inclusive and diverse workforce is ensuring that employees from all backgrounds—especially those from historically excluded or marginalized groups—have the same opportunity to grow and develop their careers. Over the past year, we have deepened and expanded our growth & development work across regions, audiences, and levels. One example where we’ve seen success is the Catalyst Program, which focuses on leadership development for employees from underrepresented racial groups in EMEA and Latin America. Catalyst expanded this year into three connected programs tailored to employees at different seniority levels and at different stages of their development journeys. Catalyst has had impressive results in supporting retention and career transformation by focusing on both employees and their managers. As our growth and development strategy has evolved, we’re deepening investments in groups like women in leadership, women in technical roles, and leaders of color. We’re also expanding our footprint with new initiatives focused on the Asian American, Pacific Islander communities, and LGBTQ+ communities. [Learn more about this work here] Inclusion Recruiting We made significant strides in inclusive hiring in FY21. Globally, we continued our focus on women in leadership in all regions and women in technical roles in the U.S., China, and India. In the U.S., we saw by far our strongest year ever growing our Black and Latino employee population, with particular strength in leadership driven by a focus on building diverse pipelines. Beyond these groups, we invested in inclusive hiring practices to mitigate bias and create inclusive experiences for candidates across a wide range of social identities. Our Diverse Slates Program is core to our hiring strategy, designed to reinforce a systematic approach to evaluating a diverse slate of candidates each time we hire. This intentional focus helps hold our recruiters and hiring managers accountable for creating more opportunities to hire people that reflect the diversity of our communities and LinkedIn members. In its first two years, this initiative has contributed to the increase in our hiring representation, which has in turn increased diversity in our employee workforce. While this is a critical component of our strategy, a diverse slate initiative only succeeds when paired with a comprehensive inclusion recruiting strategy that combines talent attraction, nurture, and hiring processes to mitigate bias. We’ve invested in each of these areas in support of a comprehensive approach to inclusive hiring. Strategic Partnerships Collaborating with partner organizations and external experts has been integral to our DIBs and Equity strategies. Across LinkedIn, we work with over 50 partners that share our focus around creating diverse and inclusive workplaces. Our partners share invaluable expertise and work with us directly to develop our talent strategy. This strategy includes connecting LinkedIn with talent pools through Blavity Inc.’s Afrotech platform in the United States, and Career Trackers focused on Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We are also expanding the way we engage external expertise and resources to strengthen professional development and build an inclusive environment for employees, working with organizations like OutLeadership, HITEC, and Prospanica. The second component of our partner strategy focuses on our shared objective of creating equity for professionals outside of LinkedIn's walls. We work with organizations serving a wide range of communities to empower them to use LinkedIn to build a community for their members, amplify their voices, and connect with economic opportunities. We have seen a 70% increase in the number of LinkedIn followers of our major DIBs partners and increased engagement, enabled by partner forums, access to our DIBS Resource Hub, the AdGrants Program, LinkedIn Influencer program, and online community building and events. [Learn more about this work here] Equity for the Global Workforce In March 2021, we formally launched our Equity Strategy. This is a cross-LinkedIn journey focused on creating equal access to opportunity and helping drive more equitable outcomes for all members of the global workforce. The endeavor is ambitious in scope and includes the ways our platform creates value for our diverse member base, the products we build to help our customers pursue their diversity, equity and inclusion goals, and the interactions that take place on LinkedIn every day. We have expanded the Self-ID feature on LinkedIn to better understand and identify unfair bias on our platform and take proactive steps to mitigate that bias as well as inform product and feature updates. We have continued to make investments in our platform and products as well as in our content review policies, practices, and teams to better protect members from harassment and encourage the necessary and sometimes uncomfortable dialogue around equity and social justice. Equity for the global workforce starts with us, that’s why LinkedIn’s efforts to create more equitable outcomes for our members is deeply connected with our internal Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging strategy. As we look to the years ahead, we are especially mindful of building sustained, lasting impact in Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. Programs like our Inclusive Leadership for Managers initiative are one way we plan to do this. Another is to more deeply embed principles of equity into the core of our talent processes. Building programs to support DIBs is essential. However, we are also investing in systematic approaches to talent development, compensation and benefits, hybrid work, and other talent foundations beyond our programming. We create better work experiences for all employee groups across the company through our DIBs efforts, as we inspire employees to do the best and most important work of their careers. Editor’s Note: Historically, we reported representation as a percentage of the workforce who self-identify. Aligning to Microsoft, we now report representation based on the total workforce population, inclusive of those who choose not to self-identify. If totaling only the members of the workforce who self-identify, 2021 LinkedIn representation data would be as follows for historical comparison: 5.0% Black (+1.1 pp year over year); 4.2% Black leadership (+1.6 pp year over year); 6.8% Latino (+0.6 pp year over year); 4.7% Latino leadership (+1.1 pp year over year); 41.9% Women in leadership (+0.1 pp year over year); 25.4% Women in tech (+1.4 pp year over year).

In Ontario, Canada specifically, it’s been devastating to see over 400,000 people lose their jobs, with the youth unemployment rate hovering around a staggering 17.2%. To help overcome this challenge, the Government of Ontario has selected LinkedIn to provide learning, labor market insights, and recruiting products to help Ontarians find and secure job opportunities. These resources will be made available across Ontario’s broader Employment Services network through close collaboration between LinkedIn and First Work. Funded by the Government of Ontario, together First Work and LinkedIn will provide: LinkedIn Talent Insights licenses to help employment service providers access real-time data and insights on talent pools and labor market information to create job pathways for their members LinkedIn Recruiter licenses to help employment service providers pinpoint and connect with local organizations that may want to hire youth learners 100,000 LinkedIn Learning licenses to empower job seekers to build the in-demand skills they need to get hired First Work will equip its association of over 90 community-based agencies, such as JobStart, Achev, and ACCES Employment, as well as the hundreds of other Ontario employment service providers and the people they serve with these resources. This access to helpful labor insights, job tools and resources, will help Ontarians better identify job pathways and build the skills they need to land and keep a job. “Initiatives like these, which accelerate upskilling for jobseekers while further digitizing the employment sector, are critical as Ontario faces a prolonged pandemic recovery,” said Akosua Alagaratnam, Executive Director of First Work. “Our collaboration with LinkedIn, in partnership with the government, will help strengthen Ontario’s employment sector and economic recovery by making sure those furthest from the labour market receive the support they need to achieve and retain employment. “Workers and their families have faced exceptional challenges due to COVID-19 and need a hand up to re-start their careers,” said Minister McNaughton of the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development. “Access to online training helps them gain the skills they need. Together, we will ensure nobody is left behind and prepare those eager to work for the in-demand jobs that will rebuild our province.” Through this collaboration, we can continue to create more equal access to opportunity through learning and skills to help prepare Ontarians for the jobs of today and tomorrow. We’re excited to continue working with governments around the world to help to facilitate economic growth by taking a skills-based approach to opportunity.

If you’re someone who isn’t looking for the big city vibe to start your career, here are the fastest growing regions with entry level job postings. Translating your skills to the workforce We analyzed millions of job postings across industries to pinpoint the 5 most in-demand skills for new grads or anyone just starting their career. Make sure to list these skills on your LinkedIn Profile if you have them or take the free LinkedIn Learning courses linked below to learn something new. Here are the top five skills most highly in demand by employers. Analytical Skills Learning Data Analytics Data Fluency: Exploring and Describing Data Learning Data Visualization Project Management Project Management Foundations Project Management Foundations: Ethics Project Management Foundations: Requirements Customer Service Customer Service Foundations Customer Service: Problem Solving and Troubleshooting Building Rapport with Customers Marketing Online Marketing Foundations Content Marketing Foundations Email and Newsletter Marketing Foundations Time Management Time Management: Working from Home Working and Collaborating Online Remote Work Foundations Networking for new graduates has never been more important With federal, state and local health laws scuttling in-person professional events and networking opportunities, we saw the 2020 graduating class turn to virtual networking on LinkedIn. We saw an uptick of 18% in the rate at which LinkedIn connections were formed by the 2020 graduating class relative to the class of 2019. Of positive note were US graduates who finished their Associates Degree in 2020. More specifically, the rate at which these members formed more connections on LinkedIn was 30% higher than their 2019 counterparts. In comparison, the increase for Bachelor’s students was 17%. For grads looking for more resources on how to network and find your next job visit, opportunity.linkedin.com. Methodology: LinkedIn’s Economic Graph team analyzed millions of entry-level job postings to identify the most common and fastest growing positions listed on the platform. The team examined jobs posted on LinkedIn between January 1 and March 31 of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Job postings are categorized as entry-level by job posters when they submit openings on LinkedIn. LinkedIn identified recent graduates based on Bachelor’s and Associate’s degree completion dates listed in members’ profiles. For the in-demand skills section, the Economic Graph team examined skills requirements in full time entry-level job postings between January 1 and March 31 of 2019, 2020 and 2021, identifying the most frequently cited required skills in the widest array of industries. LinkedIn salary data comes from anonymous member-submitted salary information as well as compensation data from other proprietary sources. The Network Formation Rate is the number of LinkedIn connections formed by a cohort of students in the 6 months leading up to, and after graduation, divided by the number of students in that cohort. We control for things like survivorship bias by looking only at members who got hired within the 6 months of graduating. This helps us understand how quickly various groups of members are forming connections, and compare this across groups."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2021/april/linkedin-business-highlights-from-microsoft-s-fy21-q3-earnings","date":"2021-04-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"LinkedIn Business Highlights from Microsoft’s FY21 Q3 Earnings","text":"Yesterday, Microsoft announced Q3 FY21 Earnings.

We saw record engagement again this quarter as LinkedIn’s 756 million professionals looked to connect, learn, create content, and find jobs. Conversations increased 43%, content shared was up 29%, and hours on LinkedIn Learning increased 80%. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions revenue was up more than 60% year over year. And over the past 12 months, LinkedIn’s advertising business has surpassed $3 billion in revenue; it is growing nearly three times faster than the B2B digital advertising market overall. LinkedIn Talent Solutions annual contracts and job postings also improved with the job market. We are helping creators use LinkedIn to expand their economic opportunity. Thousands of expert instructors are monetizing their content on LinkedIn Learning, freelancers can now attract clients with dedicated pages, and, with Creator mode, members can build a following and engage communities. In a world facing a growing skills gap, we are also helping employers create feedback loops between skills, learning, credentials, and jobs. 60% of the Fortune 500 use LinkedIn Learning to skill and upskill their employees. Nationwide Insurance, for example, is using LinkedIn Learning to provide personalized learning curriculum to 26,000 associates.

The study illuminates many of the goals and perceived barriers members are currently experiencing across the region amid COVID-19. Below is the full forward for that study authored by Vice President of Talent and Learning Solutions in APAC Feon Ang: In 2020, as we figured out how to thrive in the new normal, opportunities came in new and unconventional ways. For most of us, it meant surviving first, adapting second, and then finally figuring out how to put our best foot forward. In our third edition of the LinkedIn Opportunity Index study – which aims to find out the goals of people across Asia Pacific and the perceived barriers standing in their way – it was disappointing to see that the pandemic has affected women disproportionately. LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. We believe women are equal contributors to the workforce but our research shows they continue to receive far fewer opportunities compared to their male counterparts. This year, the study spans seven markets across the Asia Pacific region and we surveyed over 10,000 respondents, both men and women, to find out their aspirations and concerns. While there’s no doubt we’ve seen progress in workplace diversity as conversations around the topic have grown, our study shows there’s plenty of room to expand further and make a real impact with more action. I sincerely hope our research will ignite important conversations and drive the changes many of us want to see. I believe that more can be done to encourage people to adopt a broader mindset, especially when it comes to gender roles, and implement policies that champion women both in the workplace and at a national level. Together, we can level the playing field.

New LinkedIn Profile tools to help members and job seekers stand out to opportunities In addition, we’re launching new LinkedIn Profile features to help our members better represent themselves in a more authentic way, and share their career goals and aspirations. A post on our LinkedIn blog today from our Chief Product Officer, Tomer Cohen, gives a full overview of this news. Cover Story allows members to upload a short video to their Profile to bring to life their story. For job seekers, Cover Story is a great way to showcase their personality and demonstrate soft skills to recruiters and hiring managers. Pronoun fields (optional) where members can add their gender pronouns and showcase their core identity at the top of their Profile. Creator mode helps members who share content and insights on LinkedIn grow a following by more prominently displaying their content and adding hashtags about topics in their area of expertise. Service Pages help freelancers looking to grow their business attract new clients by listing the services they offer, linked to their Profile. Virtual job seeking in the age of COVID-19 To understand how the job seeking and hiring process has evolved since COVID-19, we conducted a survey* to job seekers and hiring managers in the U.S. Key findings include: Authentic representation at work has become increasingly important More than 50% (56%) of job seekers believe how they represent themselves at work has changed since COVID-19. Almost 50% (46%) of respondents say they’re more likely to be their authentic self in how they show up in the workplace vs. a year ago. More than 50% (55%) of job seekers agree that gender is an important aspect of their identity, both in and out of the workplace, and 70% of job seekers believe it’s important that recruiters and hiring managers know their gender pronoun. More than 70% (72%) of hiring managers believe having clarity about a candidates self-identification (i.e. gender pronouns) is beneficial and helps others to be respectful of their identity. Job seekers are seeking new ways to stand out; demonstrating soft skills is critical Almost 80% (79%) of job seekers believe that as a result of COVID-19, the job search has become more competitive and they need to find new ways to stand out to recruiters. Almost 80% (76%) of job seekers wish there was a better way to represent themselves to recruiters and hiring managers, and more than 70% (74%) believe it is important to highlight soft skills. Almost 70% (69%) of hiring managers agree that soft skills are hard to assess in a job candidate, and 75% believe a standard resume is insufficient in evaluating a candidate’s soft skills. Video is a key channel for job seekers to stand out in the hiring process Almost 80% (79%) of hiring managers believe that video has become more important when it comes to interacting with or vetting job candidates, and more than 60% (61%) of job seekers believe a recorded video could be the next iteration of the traditional cover letter. More than 60% (62%) of job seekers believe sharing more about themselves, their experience and career goals on video could help them land a job. And hiring managers agree - almost 80% (76%) of hiring managers believe seeing a pre-recorded video of a job seeker would be useful. 59% of job seekers believe video is becoming the new norm as part of the job seeking process, and 41% have used video to stand out to recruiters and hiring managers. Job seekers feel sharing a video with hiring managers would be helpful because it allows them to better highlight their personality (57%) and showcase their true self (41%).

Equal Pay Day in the U.S. is a moment to voice our support for addressing the historical, systemic and persistent pay gap between men and women and with underrepresented groups. At LinkedIn, we do ongoing reviews of employee pay for general fairness and competitiveness. Since 2015, we have also reviewed employee pay with a lens focused on internal equity. Our pay reviews take a number of the factors that most commonly impact pay levels into account, and when we find issues, we take action and make adjustments. In 2016, we joined two dozen other companies in signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge, a public commitment to do the work necessary inside our company and across the private sector to close the national pay gap. After our most recent annual review cycle in October 2020, we conducted a “pay gap analysis” on our employees’ pay to take measure of where we are when we look at comparable employees performing similar work. Our results showed that globally for every $1.00 earned by men, our female employees earn $0.998 and in the US, our employees of color earn $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by our white employees. More details on LinkedIn’s equity and inclusion efforts can be found in our 2020 Workforce Diversity Report. We’re committed to this journey and know there is more work to be done.

To inspire and inform leaders as they navigate the new world of work, we surveyed 1,236 L&D pros and 861 learners and looked at behavioral insights on how people use LinkedIn Learning. We also conducted interviews with best-in-class leaders to gain insight into how the state of L&D is changing within their organizations and how they plan to approach learning strategies in the year ahead. Report highlights include: L&D has a permanent seat in the C-suite, and their role is evolving, with upskilling and reskilling as the top priority 63% of L&D pros globally agree that L&D has a seat at the executive table, up from 24% in March 2020. With the projected permanent seat for L&D in the c-suite in 2021 (per 66% of L&D pros up from 24% in March), the top of mind priorities in rank order are: upskilling and reskilling (59%), leadership and management (53%), and virtual onboarding (33%). Nearly two-thirds (64%) of L&D pros globally — and nearly three-quarters (73%) in North America — report that their executives have made Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) programs a priority. 51% of L&D pros say that internal mobility is more of a priority now than before COVID-19, with employees at companies with high internal mobility staying almost 2x longer. Since COVID-19, internal hires make up a greater share of all hires. Resilience and digital fluency are the power skills needed in 2021 When we asked L&D pros globally to share which skills were most important to be successful in the new world of work, we gave them many options to choose from — from time management to communication across remote teams. The results that came back were loud and clear: resilience landed the number one slot, and digital fluency came in second in every country we surveyed. Nearly two-thirds (60%) of learners agree that learning makes them more adaptable. Gen Z is learning more than ever to advance their careers 69% of Gen Z learners reported that they are making more time to learn, and our platform data shows Gen Z learners watched 50% more hours per learner of learning content in 2020 vs. 2019 76% of Gen Z learners believe that learning is the key to a successful career. They want to learn new skills to uplevel their performance (83%), and explore topics that they’re curious about (73%). These numbers ranked higher than any other generation when we asked them the same questions. Gen Z also spends 12% more of their time on LinkedIn Learning building their hard skills when compared to the average learner Community-based learning increases engagement Learners who use social features — Q&A, course shares, learning groups — watch 30x more hours of learning content than learners who don’t. 91% of L&D pros globally agree that teams that learn new skills together are more successful We hope these insights will help L&D teams build programs around skills that will inspire executives and employees to co-create a culture of learning that rewards existing employee skills, and fosters their development of new, high-demand skills. Methodology We surveyed 1,260 L&D Professionals and 814 Learners in November 2020 in English, French, and German. The full list of countries we surveyed include: US, UK, India, Canada, Australia, Germany, Singapore, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, France, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Hong Kong, Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Iceland, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Austria, and Switzerland.

These integrations bring managers visibility into how their people are feeling in their jobs and give employees access to learning opportunities all within their daily Microsoft 365 and Teams workflow. Since distributed work has become our new normal, many of us struggle to stay connected to our teams, manage burnout, and prioritize our own wellbeing. Adapting to change can be challenging, but having actionable insights on the wellbeing of our teams and being able to unearth new learning opportunities to keep employees engaged is critical in addressing issues before they bubble up to the surface. Here are a few more specifics about our integrations with Microsoft Viva: Glint: With Glint’s integration with Microsoft Viva Insights, HR and business leaders can combine aggregated and de-identified employee feedback from Glint —”how people feel”— with aggregated and de-identified collaboration data from Viva Insights — “how people work\" — to deeply understand key aspects of the employee experience and, most importantly, identify concrete and objective ways to improve it. LinkedIn Learning: To support continual learning and skills development right in the flow of daily work, LinkedIn Learning is building a deep integration with Microsoft Viva Learning so employees can discover, view, and share world-class content from LinkedIn Learning directly within Teams. Employees will also receive recommendations from LinkedIn Learning in the daily briefing email from Cortana. The Next Step in Our Joint Commitment As we continue delivering on our joint commitment with Microsoft, our vision extends beyond helping job seekers to supporting people’s success after they are hired.

Today, following our joint commitment with Microsoft to help get 25 million people back to work, LinkedIn announced new insights that shed light on what’s next as we enter the new year. To help support the millions of people trying to get back into the workforce, we looked at the fastest-growing jobs of the past year and at courses and other tools that can help job seekers take the next step. There is demand for workers from every background As we do at the start of each year, we’re taking a look at the most in-demand jobs in the U.S. But this year, we’re also looking at how things have changed over the past year. Here are the top five fastest-growing job trends based on LinkedIn data over the past year, each reflecting a collection of closely-related roles where demand is expanding quickly. Read more about these and 10 additional trends from LinkedIn editor, Andrew Seaman. This is based on an analysis of jobs data by YoY growth and quantity from April-October 2020. These are the top 5 Jobs on the Rise right now 1. Professionals on the frontlines of e-commerce As many sheltered in place this year, retailers and logistics companies onboarded thousands of e-commerce workers to help get products from the store into the hands of customers. Hiring for these roles grew 73% year-over-year — and that demand continues with over 400,000 open jobs right now.

Health care supporting staff The coronavirus pandemic caused a sudden and sustained need for doctors and nurses, but it also created the same demand for the people who support health care professionals.

LinkedIn data shows that you’re 2X more likely to hear from a recruiter when you indicate that you’re Open to Work. Don’t forget to set up Job Alerts to stay updated on new job postings that match your preferences. Applying within the first 10 minutes of receiving a job notification increases your chances of hearing back by up to 4X. Get ready for your (virtual) closeup. When it comes to the interview, more than 50 percent of people say they lack confidence. LinkedIn interview preparation tools can help you prepare for some of the most common questions that are asked in the screening process, with access to quality videos and tips by experts and hiring managers, immediate AI-powered feedback, and specific interview tracks for in-demand roles like sales, engineering, and marketing. Explore your career path. LinkedIn’s Career Explorer can uncover new opportunities looking for the skills and experience you already have. We’ll show you roles people like you have transitioned into, the skills you may need, with LinkedIn Learning courses to build them; connect you with open jobs on LinkedIn; and find members who have those jobs and can help support you. Methodology Jobs on the Rise are defined as the career categories that have seen the highest year-on-year growth rates in hiring, looking at the April 2020 to October 2020 timeframe. LinkedIn’s Economic Graph data scientists looked across 15,000+ job titles to uncover the jobs that have grown the most compared to 2019 levels, those titles were then grouped into overarching career trends that capture as many as 25 job titles within each category. Each trend summary above calls out the three largest job titles within that trend. Career trends are ranked using a combination of year-over-year growth rate combined with the raw size of the job demand. Salary ranges reflect the 25th percentile and 75th percentile levels within that career trend, using LinkedIn Salary data. To identify the “top courses,” we looked at LinkedIn members who were hired at a new company between Nov 1, 2019 - Oct 31, 2020 and were also “active learners” in the 12 months before being hired (watched at least 5 minutes of content or logged in at least 5 times). We then compared the top 100 courses watched by this group to the learning behavior of all learners, to identify courses where new hire learners “over-index”. The courses highlighted here are thus the courses that recently hired members are more likely to watch than the average learner."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/december/new-product-gives-sales-operations-teams-access-to-real-time-dat","date":"2020-12-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Business Solutions","Product News"],"title":"New product gives sales operations teams access to real-time data at scale","text":"Today we are introducing LinkedIn Sales Insights, a new product in the LinkedIn Sales Solutions portfolio that is powered by over 722 million members on LinkedIn to help Sales Operations teams identify and size potential opportunities, get a clearer view of the market, and plan more confidently. The function of Sales Operations is becoming increasingly important to high performing sales teams. In fact, the number of Sales Ops roles more than doubled in the last two years, increasing 2.7x as fast as the sales function overall. But, Sales Ops teams, and the plans they build, are only as successful as the data foundation by which they operate on. Unlike much of the inaccurate and stale data that Sales Ops teams have cobbled together from disparate sources over the years, LinkedIn Sales Insights data is generated by a vast global network of highly engaged members. And, as a result, this new product provides Sales Ops teams with visibility into: Potential business opportunities in specific regions, territories, and industries based on growth trends The makeup of specific departments and functions across key accounts Buyer-seller relationships to better connect sales reps with individual buyers With LinkedIn Sales Insights, Sales Ops can more strategically partner with Sales Leaders to assign books of business based upon dynamic, real-time data, while also adding a lens of relationship strength and connectivity to their go-to-market strategy. As a result, their sellers can get off to a faster start, knowing that the accounts in their books of business represent the highest potential opportunities to drive revenue. Sales organizations are turning to LinkedIn Sales Insights to ensure the Sales Ops team has the necessary information to feel more confident about their sales plan, while they are using Sales Navigator to allow their sales reps to execute on those plans seamlessly.

A post on our LinkedIn blog today from our head of product, Tomer Cohen, gives a full overview of this news. We’re introducing new resources in the midst of a pandemic that has disrupted our global economy, left 140 million people without a job and put another 1.6 billion at risk of income loss -- with low-income workers, women and underrepresented communities the hardest hit. With our unique insights into jobs and skills, our thriving community of 722 million members worldwide, and our vision of helping every member of the global workforce connect to economic opportunity, LinkedIn is uniquely positioned to help. A look at the state of the labor market and skills in demand The faint tailwinds of labor market recovery are stalling, according to our latest hiring data. Hiring has improved since the pandemic first struck, but most countries haven’t returned to consistent labor market growth; for countries still grappling with COVID-19, hiring may have hit a ceiling. But there is some good news: we’re seeing pockets of hiring growth and there are 14+ million jobs available on LinkedIn globally today. Digital skills are in particular demand, and we estimate the technology sector will add nearly 150 million jobs in the next 5 years. To help members prepare for those opportunities, we’ve identified the fastest growing skills globally on LinkedIn since COVID-19 hit -- from digital skills like data analysis, digital marketing and programming. New tools and resources to help job seekers We’re releasing new features to make it easier for job seekers to engage their professional community and land a job: Our new, interactive Career Explorer tool, now available in beta, can help job seekers map out their next step. Using LinkedIn data, the tool shows job seekers how their skills and past experience can translate into new roles, and provides LinkedIn Learning courses needed to fill in any skills gaps. It also allows job seekers to see who in their network has relevant experience so they can easily reach out for guidance and advice. Our #OpenToWork profile photo frame makes it easier for job seekers to engage their professional community and discover opportunities. More than three million members globally have tried our new #OpenToWork profile photo frame, and are receiving, on average, 40% more InMails from recruiters. They also are 20% more likely to receive messages from the broader LinkedIn community. 70% of talent professionals globally say virtual interviews are here to stay. We’ve expanded our Interview Prep tools to include new content for in-demand jobs, like project manager and software engineer. That way, we can help job seekers prepare for interviews online and increase their chances of landing the most sought-after roles. Job seekers can access nearly 1,000 hours of free learning courses from Microsoft and LinkedIn at opportunity.linkedin.com. Since June, nearly 13 million people around the world have learned new skills related to the most in-demand roles. Making it easier to discover the 14+ million jobs on LinkedIn We’re introducing a #Hiring profile photo frame for hiring managers, along with the ability to add jobs directly to their profile. Hirers can more easily signal open roles to their networks and beyond, and job seekers can see who’s hiring directly in their feed. We’re also inviting anyone who is hiring to post a job on LinkedIn for free. This will help small-and-medium businesses in particular get their open roles onto LinkedIn and discover talent faster. Changing the perception of unemployment To understand Americans’ changing perception on unemployment in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also conducted a survey of those who have become recently unemployed, working professionals and hiring managers. The key findings highlight that, while the majority of unemployed Americans believe there’s a stigma associated with unemployment, people want to help. Despite tens of millions of people in the U.S. being out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of unemployed Americans believe there’s a stigma associated with unemployment, yet nearly all hiring managers would hire someone currently unemployed and those asking others for help are being met with opportunity. 84% of Americans believe there’s a stigma associated with unemployment. 67% believe this stigma is affecting their ability to get hired. Yet almost all hiring managers (96%) would hire a candidate who was laid off due to the pandemic. 84% of people would be willing to help someone in their community who has lost their job as a result of COVID-19. Many already have: 76% have helped someone else find or get a job. The unemployed aren’t talking about being out of work openly or asking for help enough. Americans feel embarrassed (24%), uneasy (23%) and ashamed (15%) about telling other people they are currently unemployed. Almost half (46%) have lied about being out of work. Almost one-third (27%) of those who are unemployed have not asked people they know for help with their job search, mostly because they think they don’t know anyone who can help (41%), they’re embarrassed to ask for help (30%), they don’t think people are willing to help (20%), or they don’t know how to ask for help (18%). Only half (50%) of unemployed Americans have posted on social media about being unemployed or looking for a job. While most (82%) think networking virtually is a helpful tool for finding a new job, they’re not doing it enough: less than half have been actively networking while unemployed. Other pain points for the unemployed center around job search frustration, loneliness and money. The most frustrating part of the job search while unemployed is not hearing back from jobs applied to (40%), followed by not enough open jobs in their industry (31%) or not finding jobs that match their skills (31%). Many haven’t tried to switch jobs/industries yet because they don’t know where to start (45%), think they aren’t qualified for any other industry (33%), don’t have connections in other industries (32%), or don’t know how their skills translate (28%). 75% of people feel lonely since they became unemployed. Almost all Americans would be willing to help someone in their community who has lost their job as a result of COVID-19, and many already have. How would they help? By providing a recommendation (59%) or by making connections/introductions to people in their professional community (41%). One-third (33%) of people who have requested help were provided with help immediately, with most having had someone review their resume or being introduced to people that might be willing to hire them. Hiring managers say that when they see a job seeker post on social media about looking for new opportunities, it conveys resourcefulness (48%), proactive problem solving (39%) and confidence (33%). An introduction or referral could make all the difference. The #1 thing those who are unemployed want from their community during their job search process is to introduce them to people who might be willing to hire them. Most people (73%) have been hired as a result of someone they know making an introduction or a connection, or because they had a personal connection to someone within the company (70%). Almost all (89%) hiring managers say referrals are important when filling an open position: when someone in their network refers a candidate to them, not only will they pay closer attention to that candidate's resume (49%), but it increases the likelihood they’ll interview the candidate (52%). Plus, more than one-quarter (26%) of hiring managers say they’re more likely to hire a referred candidate.

Survey Methodology: This data was collected via a Censuswide survey fielded from October 7-20, 2020 among 2,000 survey respondents ages 18-74 across the U.S. who became unemployed within the last eight months, 2,000 working professionals, and 1,000+ hiring managers."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/october/linkedin-business-highlights-from-microsoft-s-fy21-q1-earnings","date":"2020-10-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"LinkedIn Business Highlights from Microsoft’s FY21 Q1 Earnings","text":"Yesterday, Microsoft announced Q1 FY21 Earnings.

As an organization that exists to create economic opportunity for the entire global workforce, we recognize the responsibility we have to help build that future, both within our workforce and for our hundreds of millions of members and customers. In the long-term, this means building towards a world where professional organizations are a reflection of the communities in which they operate. As a company, we’re making a commitment to double the number of Black and Latino leaders, managers, and senior individual contributors on our U.S. team over the next five years. This commitment represents just one part of our broader strategy. The extended work we’re doing in support of this commitment will lift our efforts globally. ++ At a time of global focus on racial injustice and a pandemic that has disproportionately affected Black and Latino communities in the United States, along with other marginalized communities worldwide, the work of economic equity has never been more important. We believe companies -- as the enablers of wealth creation and professional mobility -- must play a leading role in building a more equitable future for all. And as an organization that exists to create economic opportunity for the entire global workforce, we recognize the responsibility we have to help build that future, both within our workforce and for our millions of members and customers. In the long-term, this means building towards a world where professional organizations are a reflection of the communities where they operate. Our Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging strategy begins with LinkedIn’s workforce, with an ongoing focus on increasing representation of underrepresented communities and building an environment of inclusion and belonging at LinkedIn. This strategy is both broad in scope and global, including a focus on gender, underrepresented racial groups, and other historically marginalized groups in every region where we operate. To infuse this work more deeply in our decision-making and operations, we’ve added a new value to our LinkedIn company values for the first time since their creation in 2008: “Embody Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging.” We’re introducing a new commitment to double the number of Black and Latino leaders, managers, and senior individual contributors on our U.S. team over the next five years. By focusing on increasing and maintaining diversity in senior positions and the leadership pipeline, we’re centering attention on roles with the most responsibility and decision-making authority, while also enhancing development pathways for underrepresented talent at all levels. This commitment represents just one part of our broader strategy, and though we don’t yet measure race and ethnicity outside of the U.S., the work we’re doing in support of this commitment will lift our efforts for all marginalized and underrepresented groups globally. Below, you’ll find a summary of how we’re putting our vision into practice in the near and long term, including our progress in FY20, and the aspirations that will guide us as we work hard to build a more diverse and inclusive LinkedIn. Doubling down on an environment of inclusion This year, our top talent initiative is focused on building a people manager population who are world class at inclusive leadership. Managers have an outsized impact on the work of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. They are responsible for hiring and promotion decisions, coaching and developing the people on their teams, and setting the tone for an inclusive culture. Recognizing that leading inclusively and mitigating bias will take sustained focus, we’re putting into place a strategy with three key pillars: Expectations, where we’ve rolled out a framework defining what inclusive leadership looks like for every manager at LinkedIn Education, beginning with a foundational live-virtual learning course called Leading with Inclusion offered in every global region Accountability, where we’re developing processes to make inclusive leadership a requirement for success as a manager at LinkedIn A critical component of our inclusive leadership work is that it will be global from the start. The practices and principles we apply will help build a culture of belonging for employees of many different historically marginalized backgrounds. We’ve already rolled out live virtual training in all three of our global regions, with participants from 20 offices to date. Our senior leaders, including the executive team and vice presidents, engaged in this learning path this past quarter. Extending beyond the people manager population, we’ve activated allyship circles in over a dozen offices around the world. We’ve also deepened our focus on people with disabilities, launching a series of learning sessions in our India, Japan, and China offices focused on building an inclusive environment for people with disabilities, and this year, we were recognized by the Disability Equality Index (DEI) as being one of the “2020 Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion,” scoring 100 in the ranking. Retaining and developing our employees In conjunction with our focus on creating an environment of inclusion, retention and development of underrepresented employee populations is a principal FY21 objective. While we saw an increase in Black and Latino retention in the U.S. over the course of FY20, we are focused on closing the remaining gap in retention between employees from underrepresented groups and our overall retention rate. We are expanding our Leadership, Engagement, and Development (LEAD) program, which is focused on engaging and developing Black and Latino talent in the U.S., to help accelerate career growth and build our leadership pipeline. This year, we are adding additional programs focused on Black and Latino people managers and senior leaders. While we only report on race and ethnicity in the U.S. today, our focus on retention and development is global. This year, we are scaling the ImpactIn mentorship program which focuses on mentoring underrepresented talent globally, and Catalyst, a professional development program focused on underrepresented racial groups in EMEA and Latin America, in an effort to double the number of annual participants. We are also continuing to invest in gender equity with a particular focus on women in leadership and women in technical roles through our Women’s Initiative (WIN), Women in Tech (WIT) cohort programs in the U.S., India, and China, and our EmpowerIn initiative for women in leadership in APAC. We’re also increasing our focus on building LinkedIn leaders from within our nine Employee Resource Groups with the recent launch of our C.E.O. (Collaborate, Empower, and Own) Employee Resource Group Program. This program has provided leadership training to over 200 ERG leaders globally, representing groups including the LGBTQ+ community, Veterans, Asian Americans, parents, caregivers, and more. These programs exist within our broader company-wide learning and development strategy and offerings for all employees aligning with our “Something for Everyone” approach: Career and growth-focused live workshops for individual contributors like Drive Your Development, ManageIn program for managers, True North Leadership for directors, Data Driven University, the Apprentice Manager Program for Engineers, and much more including multiple workshops focused on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. We also offer a wide range of LinkedIn Learning resources for employees worldwide which include topics on allyship, anti-racism, and mentorship by DEI experts such as Mary-Frances Winters, Arianna Huffington, Vernā Myers, Dereca Blackmon, and Kwame Christian. Diversifying LinkedIn through hiring Our global hiring efforts have helped to increase our workforce diversity over time. We’ve seen traction over the past 12 months in three core areas – increasing the inclusivity of our hiring, attracting a more diverse set of talent, and nurturing meaningful relationships that lead to opportunities. A key initiative launched in the U.S. in FY20 has been our work to achieve a diverse slate of candidates – inclusive of Black and Latino talent, as well as women for technical and leadership roles – at onsite interview stages. In FY20, we saw greater accountability for hiring inclusively by both managers and recruiters, with a double-digit increase in the achievement rate of diverse slates for hires year-over-year. Essential to this has been our focus on candidates’ potential and capabilities that matter to the role, enabling us to consider candidates from a broader array of backgrounds. And we continue to explore other ways to evolve our approach - for example, we piloted a new hiring program in which we recruited and hired people without traditional customer support backgrounds for open roles on our Global Customer Operations team. By allowing candidates to develop and showcase the skills they needed to get hired, we were able to broaden our talent pool and hire qualified people from non-traditional backgrounds. Moreover, to attract a more diverse set of applicants, we’ve promoted LinkedIn’s roles through a wide range of sources, including LinkedIn talent media, focused LinkedIn events, sponsored engagements, and by partnering with organizations that support people from underrepresented groups at various career stages. Through all of this, we seek to demonstrate LinkedIn’s unique mission and strong commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. As an example, our TransformHER events created a forum to uplift and inspire women of color and allies. Our two events in FY20 – one in-person, and one virtual streamed through LinkedIn Live – saw over 4,000 live participants and over 100,000 viewers on replay, with over 1,000 registrants expressing interest in exploring opportunities at LinkedIn, globally. In the U.K., an ongoing series of LinkedIn events has focused on introducing Black professionals to opportunities at LinkedIn, while also offering opportunities to build skills and network. We believe great hiring goes beyond the transactional to establish meaningful relationships with talented individuals that allow us to find the right opportunity together. In FY20, a large portion of our external hires came through recruiter outreach, making the establishment of a strong diverse pipeline of talent essential to our hiring, particularly at the leadership level. In alignment with our 5-year commitment in the U.S., our Bridge program brings together LinkedIn recruiters with Black and Latino leaders in small gatherings to build community. Similarly, our Women Who Lead series in APAC has established a cohort of more than 40 senior female leaders across companies and countries, who engage regularly with LinkedIn and one another. We saw an acceleration of senior leadership hires from underrepresented groups in FY20 and have continued that momentum into FY21. Our focus will remain on bridging the Network Gap, building strong relationships with our recruiters, and leadership team, and keeping engaged with diverse talent for future career opportunities at LinkedIn. Returning to our commitment Our commitment to double the number of Black and Latino senior U.S. employees over the next five years represents one important marker within our broader Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging strategy. We want to be clear that our work is built to create more opportunity more fairly. Creating opportunities for some does not involve taking opportunity away from other groups; rather, our work is focused on expanding our reach and removing barriers to success that disproportionately impact underserved and marginalized communities. We believe this commitment will push us to pursue bolder approaches that will have a positive impact not only on women, Black, and Latino populations, but on our entire global workforce as we build a diverse and welcoming environment where people of all backgrounds can thrive and do their best work. Our FY20 workforce diversity report We will continue to publish our diversity numbers annually, both to contribute to the transparent dialogue on diversity in tech and to hold ourselves accountable to our five year commitment. Below, you’ll find an overview of our representation as of June 30, 2020.

A post on our LinkedIn blog today from our CEO Ryan Roslansky gives a full overview of this news. Every element in the visual refresh is intended to convey warmth and humanity: New Look and Feel This is our first major visual redesign in five years and we’re excited by this cleaner and more modern look with a focus on community. The guiding principles to bring this to life included: Warmth: We’ve infused a warm color palette with foundational canvas hues, and blue and green accents to signal action and selection. We’ve also added more rounded shapes and buttons in our user interface for a softer, friendlier experience. Intuitive: The new design optimizes for space, size, and typographic structure, and has less of that traditional “LinkedIn blue” and puts more focus on our members and their experience. This allows us to save the blue color to be a clear affordance to take action, which makes it clearer how to navigate and use the app. Simple: We’ve simplified the look and feel, adding more whitespace, and reducing divider lines and decorative icons. Inclusive: The new experience was designed to meet accessibility standards with layout decisions and elements that allow for text scaling, bigger touch targets, and emphasize contrast for readability, and we have plans to introduce a dark mode soon. We also developed new illustrations that capture a wide range of different professional fields and industries, and represent people with different abilities and ethnic backgrounds, bringing to life our vibrant community and the diverse perspectives that exist on LinkedIn. We’re infusing this concept of sharing experiences and humanizing how we interact into everything we do, including how we build our products. Introducing a More Human Way to Share with LinkedIn Stories Stories provides a more humanized and light-weight way to share everyday professional moments. Show your professional side with an extra personal touch: Stories are an authentic way for members and companies to share what’s happening at work. As Stories are shared for 24 hours and allow for private feedback, the story full-screen format is a great way to express professional moments with your LinkedIn network without worrying that the content is permanently attached to your profile. Apply your creativity at work: With the social media landscape shifting towards visual and mobile-first content, Stories will help to have a more creative and casual way to share your professional routine. Spark conversation: Stories is a powerful way to spark conversations within professional communities: it’s a new opportunity to enhance valuable connections and share content, all connected by private messaging. Drive brand storytelling: For brands, LinkedIn Stories means another tool to build relationships and make sure viewers can keep up with the latest news and moments from companies they care about. We’re making LinkedIn Stories available in the U.S. and Canada, and globally in the coming weeks. Messaging Reimagined Conversations are the centerpiece to stay informed and find opportunities, and we’ve seen an increase in 25% of messages sent since last year. So, for those that prefer private messaging, we’re adding new ways to connect with feature updates including reactions and the ability to kick off a video meeting directly in a message thread. Making messaging more visual: This October we'll be making it easy to switch the conversation from chat to face-to-face using Microsoft Teams, BlueJeans by Verizon, or Zoom directly in your LinkedIn messages. Control over your messages with edit/delete sent: We’ve added the ability to edit or delete sent messages. We’ve made it easier to select multiple conversations at a time to archive, delete or mark them read/unread all at once. React to messages with emojis: We’ve added the ability to quickly react to messages with emojis to make it easier to express yourself. New ways to keep our community safe: We’ve added in-line message warnings to help more quickly identify inappropriate, inflammatory, harassing or hateful content so that members can report bad actors. Search Updates We’re also making it easier to find everything available on LinkedIn. Before, search was about finding people or jobs. One blended search experience: Now search will show more organized results with jobs, people, courses, groups, events and content in one result, making it easier for members to find what they need, and also explore other aspects of LinkedIn they may not have known existed. For example, when searching for “Java,” you’ll see people you may know with that skill, jobs requiring that skill, relevant LinkedIn Learning courses and related groups to join. Find it faster with more filters: We’ve also added keyword filters for people (previously available only on web) to the mobile app, as well as filters for company by location, industry and company size to all platforms. Spot more relevant insights in results: While speed is important, you need results that are relevant. That’s why we’ve added more personalized insights to search results: like surfacing your connections who work at companies with open jobs, and LinkedIn Learning courses “liked” by people who work at your company. We’ve added new result cards that let you glimpse your connections’ recent activity when you search for them, and also a “People Also Viewed” list of relevant companies or people to follow. Today’s announcement follows the launches of new tools to help people connect virtually and stay informed over the past few months. It also shares how we continue to see engagement on LinkedIn hit new highs with a 50 percent increase in people sharing, and more than 1 million hours of learning consumed every week.

Globally, the lockdowns have had a more severe impact on the share of women being hired. The data finds that the hiring of women globally - across multiple industries - followed a U-shaped trajectory in 2020. In the UAE, female hiring reached its lowest point in April when it fell to 31.3% and then recovered above the 2019 average by July 2020. The share of monthly female hires in the UAE saw an upward trajectory from May onward, reaching 35% in July 2020 and exceeding the 2019 average of 33.5%. Globally too, female hiring reached a low in April, with women only accounting for 40.6% hires, before recovering in June and July to around 44.5%. As governments around the world manage school reopening policies, this data sheds light on the economic impact of lockdown measures on working women, who are more likely to be looking after children, and underscores the importance of flexible working policies. The UAE is ranked 120th in the Global Gender Gap Index 2020, issued by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with LinkedIn, followed by Kuwait (122) and Tunisia (124). MENA labour markets are generally characterized by low female participation, the Index added. The LinkedIn data also show that female hiring improved globally as restrictions lifted and that in most countries, female hires have now returned to levels seen before the pandemic. However, women started from a lower baseline in most countries, and need to make up for the loss of hires in March/April. With more demands on their time and higher levels of stress, the risk of women leaving the workforce becomes greater and has the potential to put gender parity in the workplace at stake. Employers must be flexible and make accommodations to help women remain in employment. Karin Kimbrough, Chief Economist at LinkedIn, said: “In terms of gender, women are bearing the brunt of the global pandemic when it comes to employment opportunities and career progression. We’ve seen on LinkedIn that working mothers are struggling to balance ever-demanding workloads with increased childcare and household responsibilities and the concern is that many are considering reducing their working hours or retreating from the workforce as a result. “Our ability to avoid more widespread, permanent losses in women’s employment hinges on schools reopening and employers creating more flexible work schedules. Without this, we’ll have a very real and serious risk of losing many women from the workforce. The unfortunate reality is that the longer that this goes on, the more women will have to make the impossible choice between caring for their children and their careers. And we know these losses won’t come back easily: women will have to work harder to re-enter once they’re able. As schools reopen, now is the time for businesses to consider flexible hours, remote working and job sharing which can go a long way in supporting women and keeping them in the workforce.” Methodology: The shares of hires by gender are calculated as the total number of women who added a new employer to their profile in the same month the new job began divided by the total number of hires for the same month. Gender is self-reported by members or inferred from LinkedIn profile data."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/august/digital-library-leader-scribd-is-acquiring-slideshare","date":"2020-08-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"Digital library leader Scribd has acquired SlideShare","text":"Today, we’re announcing that digital library leader Scribd has acquired LinkedIn’s SlideShare.

We released the following joint statement: On August 7, Blake Lawit, LinkedIn's Senior Vice President and General Counsel, published the following on the LinkedIn member blog: As the United States enters the final months of this year’s election cycle, we’re mindful of the need to help our members engage on the platform with people and information they can trust. For LinkedIn, this is part of our ongoing work to maintain a safe, trusted, and professional community that allows our 700+ million members worldwide to engage in thoughtful and honest discussions. LinkedIn is a place for constructive and professional conversations, and while we value freedom of expression, we have clear content policies that apply equally to all members. They include the following: We don’t allow fake profiles or deceptive content. LinkedIn is a place for real people to share real information with their professional communities. We don’t allow fake profiles, misinformation, “deepfakes,” or other deceptive manipulated content. Our automated systems stop millions of fake accounts from ever appearing on the platform and we remove millions more once detected as fake. We have human investigation teams who detect suspicious content and we allow our members to easily report suspicious profiles and posts they see while using LinkedIn. We also work with government partners and industry peers, including our colleagues within Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program, to gather information that helps keep the platform safe. We don’t allow inappropriate or unprofessional content. Hate speech, harassment, and content intended to shock or humiliate others is also prohibited. In addition to limiting such material through technology, we empower our members to help keep LinkedIn a professional community by reporting inappropriate content. For more information about the types of content we remove, check out our most recent Transparency Report. We don’t allow political ads. We decided in 2018 that political ads aren’t right for LinkedIn. This means that we won’t accept ads supporting or opposing a particular candidate or ballot proposition, or otherwise intended to influence an election outcome. We also don’t allow fundraising ads by candidates, parties or political action committees (PACs), or ads that exploit sensitive political issues. During elections and all other times, our members come to LinkedIn for a safe and trusted community where they can express themselves professionally. We are a place for them to find reliable news, data, and insights from sources they can trust. We will continue to invest in making LinkedIn that platform, and empowering our members with the right tools to have the conversations they care about."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/august/our-commitment-to-a-zero-waste-future","date":"2020-08-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"Our commitment to a zero waste future","text":"Today, LinkedIn announced its Zero Waste commitment as part of the third phase of Microsoft's global sustainability initiative to protect and preserve our global ecosystem for future generations. Our ambitious goal to eliminate waste by 2030 is the third sprint in a broader commitment launched earlier this year focusing on carbon, water, ecosystems and waste.

This is in no way a reflection of the incredible talent that these employees possess, but instead a reflection of how we are evolving the business to better support our members and customers. While the decision will help us ensure our company and platform are resilient and emerge stronger to reach our vision, there is simply no harder decision to make. We are committed to a thoughtful and compassionate transition process and are helping with financial, healthcare, and career support. For more information, read the full note from our CEO to LinkedIn employees below. Team - We are entering our new fiscal year with a greater sense of urgency than ever to stay ahead of the paradigm shifts our members are facing. Everywhere, people are adapting to new ways of staying connected, learning, networking, selling, hiring, and finding work. We got ahead of this shift in March and moved with speed to adapt and innovate. We added many new features to our products and even launched new products like virtual events, #OpenToWork, and virtual interview feedback. We used our platform to showcase trusted news & voices, made our recruitment tools free for those fighting the pandemic, and pledged to help 25 million people worldwide acquire the skills they need for free. And thanks to all of you and your hard work, we are seeing that sense of urgency and innovation reflected in strong member engagement, record numbers of hours spent learning on the platform, and in the continued momentum across Marketing Solutions, Premium, Learning Solutions, and Sales Solutions. However, LinkedIn is not immune to the effects of the global pandemic. Our Talent Solutions business continues to be impacted as fewer companies, including ours, need to hire at the same volume they did previously. Normally, we would have rolled out our annual plan at the end of June. But as I've shared at the Company All Hands, this year we've been taking our time to get the FY21 plan right given the changing dynamics around us. And in advance of sharing the entire plan, I want to focus today specifically on the most challenging decision we’ve made to move forward with our strategy. To continue adapting and accelerating the company like we have been, we need to ensure we are focusing our efforts and resources against our most strategic priorities to set up the company for success today—and well into the future. When we took a hard look at the business, we decided we needed to make some hard calls. After weeks of discussion and deliberation, the executive team and I have made the extremely difficult decision to reduce approximately 960 roles, or about 6 percent of our employee base, across our Global Sales and Talent Acquisition organizations. I’m sharing this news today so that everyone has the complete picture of these changes and why we are making them, and I want you to know these are the only layoffs we are planning. What we are changing First, there are a set of roles in GSO that are no longer needed as we evolve the way we work with our talent media customers and small businesses. We’re seeing the product investments we've made over the past two years in LMS deliver incredible results, but we are still managing a separate talent media business in LTS. By moving from two separate media businesses to a unified approach across all customers that leverages our LMS investments, we will be able to serve our customers holistically and not have to continue duplicating costly platforms, systems, and tools internally. Similarly, in order to service more small businesses better, we must move from servicing them through a field sales team to servicing them online. To drive customer value for small businesses, we've kicked off a very substantial product investment, including our products-and-services marketplace and a unified online storefront channel strategy. This online channel approach will allow us to better serve the millions of small businesses that will need LinkedIn through this pandemic and beyond—and aligns with how we plan to focus our field sales efforts on our higher value relationships. Second, as mentioned above, COVID-19 is having a sustained impact on the demand for hiring, both in our LTS business and in our company. In GSO and GTO, there are roles that are no longer needed as we adjust to the reduced demand in our internal hiring and for our talent products globally. While this decision will help us ensure that our company and platform are resilient and emerge stronger to reach our vision, there is simply no harder decision to make as a CEO. These reductions impact our colleagues personally—talented people who have chosen to spend their time and energy working at LinkedIn. When we all chose to join LinkedIn, it was to realize our vision. And parting ways with our colleagues who share this vision is difficult. We took extreme care in making these changes and were guided by these principles, which are in line with our culture and values. Consistency and Fairness: Consistent with our culture of integrity, we prioritized fairness, consistency, and compliance throughout this process. Diversity: We were unwavering in our commitment to diversity. Compassion: We made each and every decision with compassion, pledging to help impacted employees look for other roles within the company, build new skills, and land on their feet if they no longer have a role at LinkedIn. What we are doing to support affected employees We are committed to a thoughtful and compassionate transition process and are helping with comprehensive financial, healthcare and career support. Financial: We’re providing a minimum of ten weeks of severance pay. This may increase based on tenure and country-specific practices, and is in addition to a paid notification period that varies by country. In addition, a payment in lieu of FY20 bonuses will be paid out at full target for those who are bonus-eligible, and departing employees will be eligible for our August stock vesting. Healthcare: In the U.S., we’ll pay for 12 months of continuing health insurance through COBRA to give employees and their families peace of mind during uncertain times. More broadly across the globe, we are offering 6 months of healthcare continuation or the cash equivalent in group premiums where applicable based on local plans and regulations. Career transition assistance: We’ve created a special six-month offering called Momentum to help employees successfully find their next role. This includes 1:1 coaching, workshops, and LinkedIn Learning courses on interview prep, compensation fundamentals, job search strategies, and integrating into a new role. We’re also creating an opt-in directory to help departing employees showcase their experiences and be more discoverable to potential employers. Technology: All departing employees will have the opportunity to keep LinkedIn cell phones, laptops, and recently purchased equipment to help work from home, so they have the practical tools they need to help with career transitions. Immigration support: Our global immigration team will reach out to provide personalized support to those on company-sponsored visas, and LinkedIn will also pay for one-on-one consultations with external immigration legal advisors. Potential placements: As we invest in our most strategic areas for growth, we will be hiring for newly-created roles across the company, and we will work with employees impacted by today’s announcement to explore these opportunities. What happens next In terms of what happens next, countries have different requirements for how employment decisions and notifications are handled. And I’ve sent this email at a time (11:00pm PT in California) to make sure that employees around the globe hear all of this important news from me first. In some countries, decisions about individual impact will be made and communicated this week, and in other countries, we will be starting the employment consultation process to talk through proposed changes before making and communicating decisions. I’d like to reiterate that these changes only directly impact our GSO and Talent Acquisition teams, and those who are potentially impacted will receive a meeting invite within the next two hours to learn more about next steps. If you don’t receive a meeting invite, you are not directly impacted by this change. It's important to know that while we’re announcing one set of organizational changes, the decisions about individual impacts and notifications to those employees will not occur at the same time across all countries. Affected employees who work in North America, Brazil, and parts of APAC will be made aware of impacts to their roles in the next 24 hours. These departing employees will be with us through August 21st. Impacted employees in Dubai will also be notified in the next 24 hours and will be with us through September 29th. Employees in Ireland, the UK, and Australia have begun consultation about potential impacts to roles and we will continue to work through those locally. Employees who work in France, Sweden, and Spain will learn more about proposed impact to roles during August, and employees in Italy will hear about proposed impacts in September. To our teammates who are leaving: I deeply thank you for the positive impact you’ve made. Your time and effort have been critical to helping manifest LinkedIn’s vision. Please know these changes aren't a reflection on you or your work at LinkedIn, but rather, the result of strategic changes we are making to accelerate the vision of the company. You’ve played an important role in building LinkedIn, and I am truly grateful. For everyone else: I know I can count on you to do everything in your power—through references, advice and mentoring, and connections in your network—to help our talented teammates move on to their next plays. Thank you for showing your support, gratitude and compassion for all that they’ve done to help build the company we are today and for all they’re experiencing. At our next All Hands on August 5, I’ll be sharing more about our overarching FY21 plan, strategy, and areas of growth and investment. As I said above, this is the only reduction we're planning. This is painful to go through as an organization, but a company with a vision as bold as ours will have to make difficult decisions. And since our vision is more important than it ever has been given all that’s going on in the world, I'm confident we'll emerge more resilient and stronger than ever.

Employees are spending 130% more time on learning since the pandemic 66% of L&D pros agree that their function has become a much more strategic part of their organizations 68% of of L&D pros said that the level of urgency around launching learning programs has risen significantly 56% of L&D pros agreed that their culture of learning is stronger now than before COVID-19 Leadership sees learning as a tool for navigating crisis and change. 70% say their CEOs are active champions of learning, up from 27% in March-- a 159% increase in CEO championship And that goes beyond just executives-- 68% of L&D pros said that managers are actively promoting more learning resources to their teams than before COVID-19, and managers have spend 2X more time learning in March/April compared to January/February 60% of L&D pros said they expect to spend more on online learning than they did in 2019 Employee mental health and wellbeing has entered the spotlight. 69% said that supporting the mental health and wellbeing of employees is a new part of their role since COVID-19 10X as many learners watched courses on mindfulness and stress management in April compared to February In response to social distancing, social learning has arrived. 75% of L&D pros expect an increase in social learning, where learners engage with colleagues, instructors and fellow learners around topics and course content 301% increase in professionals joining learning groups, 153% increase in courses shared, 111% increase in contributions to LiL Q&A The role of L&D is expanding in the pandemic, and will be critical as organizations look to fill skills gaps internally. 64% of L&D pros said that reskilling the current workforce to fill skills gaps is more of a priority now than ever before 74% of L&D pros agree their focus is on rebuilding or reshaping their organizations for a post COVID-19 world 62% of L&D pros agree that internal mobility is a priority for them These trends show us that L&D is in a unique position to create a strong culture of learning that will make an even greater impact on organizations, building resilience amongst their workforce so they can adapt and thrive as business evolves. Methodology For the Leading with Learning Report, we surveyed 3,155 learners in 31 countries and 864 L&D professionals (L&D and HR professionals with L&D responsibilities who have some influence on budget decisions at organizations with over 200 employees) in May 2020 and analyzed data from enterprise learner activity on the LinkedIn Learning platform from the “pre-COVID” period of January and February compared to “the COVID-19 starting point” period of March and April.

We’re sharing her full post here as well: LinkedIn has just released data showing year-on-year hiring trends across the world. Here is the summary of how COVID-19 is impacting hiring in APAC. SINGAPORE: Hiring hasn’t fallen as drastically as the other countries in this chart. However, it has been on a gradual decline since February, and is now about -10% y-o-y as of 10 April (slightly down from the previously reported rate of -7% y-o-y on 25 March). While the effect of Circuit Breaker measures (closure of non-essential services beginning 7 April) may continue to manifest over the next few weeks, these will likely be offset by the various government stimulus packages and the fact that Singapore’s labour market has historically been fairly tight. AUSTRALIA: The hiring trend in Australia is similar with the U.S. and U.K., and has been decreasing throughout April. In our previous Australia report, the hiring rate was down -2.8% y-o-y as of 19 March -- it is now around -30% y-o-y as of 10 April. With the recent four-week extension of Stage 3 restriction measures (closure of non-essential services), this downward trend may continue over the next few weeks. This may, however, be counterbalanced by government stimulus packages. CHINA: There has been a significant rebound in hiring after social distancing measures were lifted, with hiring rising up from a low of -47% y-o-y in late February to -17% y-o-y on April 10. By watching the trends in China, we can get a sense of what to expect in the coming weeks. We will continue to monitor our insights during this crisis to provide some clarity on the impact to our labour market, and the lessons that we can learn from other countries as economies try to navigate their response. Previous updates can be found here for Australia, Singapore, United Kingdom, and United States.

Built to accompany Glint Engage and Glint Perform, Glint 360s empower individuals to create development goals that sit alongside their business and other goals, resulting in a connected experience across employee engagement, performance, and development. 360-degree feedback assessments give people a holistic view of their strengths and opportunities based on input from their managers, peers, collaborators, direct reports, and a self-assessment by the individual themself. Glint 360s address the cumbersome administration, dense reporting, and siloed development plans of the past by leveraging cutting-edge technology and modern people science to prompt self-awareness and ongoing conversations about employee strengths and opportunities. These conversations help managers better support both individual and and overall team growth outside of annual performance evaluations. Some of the benefits of Glint 360s include: Giving professionals and managers the gift of rich feedback, with easy-to-use design and interactive reporting. When feedback feels relevant, easy-to-absorb, and interactive, employees are more likely to use it to improve and grow. Glint 360s make it easy to solicit feedback from not only managers and direct reports, but peers and collaborators as well. User-friendly design allows participants to easily dive deeper into their data, interpret their feedback, and understand their opportunities. Empowering employees to grow with ongoing action. Glint removes barriers to taking action and helps individuals create development goals directly from feedback in their report. Individuals also have the opportunity to involve their managers to collaborate on their goals, track progress, and be more accountable for taking action. Goals created from Glint Engage, Perform, and 360s are integrated in one platform, offering a connected experience that encourages people to take ongoing action across different initiatives. Simplifying a cumbersome process for HR admins. Glint’s approach requires less administrative work. Through automation of key processes such as set-up, communication, response tracking, follow-up, and report generation, HR teams can spend less time orchestrating administrative processes and more time focusing on strategic priorities. Glint Engage and 360s together help organizations identify groups that cite a lack of development as a key factor for disengagement and makes it easy for companies to use 360 feedback to help their employees develop their strengths, address important opportunities, and be more engaged.

The Index is a composite measure that seeks to understand how people perceive opportunity and more importantly, the gaps in getting to those opportunities. The research surveyed over 30,000 respondents in 22 markets globally. According to the research, people want to find opportunities that allow them to pursue their passion, have work-life balance, and job security. However, people generally feel that lack of financial resources, ageism and a difficult job market stand in the way of finding those opportunities. Pockets of optimism amidst uncertain economic outlook for 2020 Globally, people feel pessimistic about the state of their economy, but there are signs that this perception is changing. While 46 per cent of respondents said that they feel their economic situation has gotten worse in the past 12 months prior to the survey, only 40 per cent said they feel the situation will worsen in the next 12 months. This glimmer of hope is further underscored by 45 per cent of respondents who feel confident about finding better opportunities this year. “This research gives us a sense of how confident people are that there is an opportunity out there for them. It’s comforting to see that despite the backdrop of worry about all that is going on in the world, people are still encouraged about their opportunities to get ahead,” said Karin Kimbrough, Chief Economist at LinkedIn. “But we also know that the way we live and work is changing rapidly, and that people across the globe will have to adapt and adjust to take advantage of the opportunities the new economy will bring. It’s on each of us to create the environment that helps people reach their ambitions -- to help people take risks or invest in themselves so they earn skills and experience, and build networks that help them get the jobs they want. This year, developing markets, India, Indonesia, China, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Philippines felt most optimistic about opportunities - driven by people’s confidence in their economic growth potential, as well as their confidence in gaining access to and pursuing opportunities they identified as important. People in Mexico and Brazil also demonstrated strong optimism overall. On the other hand, the more developed markets such as Japan, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom placed below the baseline score of “100”. This denotes less optimism than others, as people in these markets expressed concerns over economic outlook, and generally felt more cautious about their chances of accessing and achieving success with opportunities that are relevant to them. The United States is an exception - while it’s one of the world’s most developed nations, people are still optimistic about the availability of opportunities and confident in achieving success at these opportunities despite a weaker economic outlook. The global workforce is the backbone of the world economy, and to sustain economic growth, an understanding of the way people access opportunity is very important. Over time, by measuring how people around the world perceive their access to opportunity, LinkedIn aims to engage in a global dialogue on creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. Ability to pursue one’s passion, achieve work-life balance and job security matter the most, but lack of financial resources, age and the job market stand in the way About 40 per cent of the respondents want to pursue their passions and attain work-life balance and 38 per cent are striving for job security, globally. For half of the Boomers surveyed, keeping their bodies and minds active is the top priority. In Asia Pacific and the UAE, work-life balance is the top most desired opportunity, while in Europe and North America, it is about pursuing their passions. In Brazil and Mexico, job security and stability are the most important for them. Globally, the lack of financial resources (24%), age (21%) and difficult job market (21%) stood out as the top three opportunity gaps that stand in the way of achieving opportunities. In fact, about 45 per cent of Boomers highlighted their age as the main roadblock as they pursue an active lifestyle and their passions at work. While often recognized as a barrier for older workers, age also manifests itself as a barrier in a different way for younger workers (Gen Z), such as a lack of work experience (25%) and confidence (21%), as well as the lack of direction and guidance (13%). Age as a barrier is the most pronounced in Europe, as well as in Australia and Japan with an aging workforce. This reflects a sense of anxiety in face of uncertain macro-economic outlook coupled with factors like age, which require a mindset shift. Contrary to popular belief, people are not resistant to change. While working hard (81%) tops the list of what it takes to get ahead in life, willingness to embrace change (80%) came in a close second. People recognize that they have to work hard; and adopt a growth mindset and lifelong learning, as the economic landscape and job market evolves. Businesses’ role to make the multigenerational workforce work With longer lifespan, people are working well beyond their retirement years - making multigenerational workforce a reality among businesses with up to four generations of employees working together for the very first time. This calls for businesses to recognize that the different age groups can complement and help one another. More companies can be an enabler of change and foster an inclusive workforce to help everyone succeed. Embracing multigenerational workforce will be key to navigating an evolving job market and harness it as a growth driver of today’s economy. ### Note to editors LinkedIn commissioned independent market research firm, GfK to conduct this study between September and October 2019. The survey was conducted among 18 to 65 year olds across 22 countries via online interviews. The survey had more than 30,000 respondents: North America: Canada, United States Latin America: Brazil, Mexico Middle East: United Arab Emirates Europe: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom Asia Pacific: Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore Age groups were classified as: Gen Z (18 - 22 years old) Millennials (23 - 38 years old) Gen X (39 - 54 years old) Boomers (55 - 65 years old) This survey was fielded from September to October 2019 and represents the world-view of survey respondents at that time. Methodology LinkedIn Opportunity Index measures a market’s level of confidence with regards to the economy and the pursuit of opportunity and uses “100” as the baseline score. A higher score represents greater optimism from respondents living in a specific country. The seven factors that contributed to a composite measure of opportunity were the same as LinkedIn Opportunity Index 2018, and are as follows: Perceptions around socio-economic and lifestyle factors: Outlook on economy over the next 12 months Outlook on respondents’ financial situation over the next 12 months Quality of life specifically happiness Quality of life compared to previous generation/parents Perceptions around opportunity: Availability of in-market opportunities Assessment on accessibility of opportunity over the next 12 months Confidence in achieving success"},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/february/ryan-roslansky-to-become-ceo-june-1","date":"2020-02-04T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","North America"],"title":"Ryan Roslansky to become CEO and Jeff Weiner to move into Executive Chairman role on June 1","text":"LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce and we continue to make progress in realizing it.

We’re sharing her full post here as well: LinkedIn's data on hiring gives us early insight into how the labour market is responding and what might lie ahead for those who are just beginning to feel the impact of COVID-19. Earlier, we published insights on how COVID-19 is impacting hiring in China and Italy, the two most impacted countries, and what that means in the US. Now, we have new insights on how COVID-19 is impacting the Australian Economy. This analysis looks at the year-on-year changes in hiring rate, which is a measure of hires divided by LinkedIn membership. The analysis was conducted for the period of 10th Feb to 19th March 2020. In recent weeks, LinkedIn’s hiring data shows a gradual decline in YoY hiring growth in Australia, with a sharp drop towards the end of last week. We anticipate this decline in hiring growth to deepen in the coming weeks. The travel bans and shutdown restrictions on social gatherings instituted by the Australian Government to tackle the pandemic have had a significant impact on jobs and hiring intentions in certain industry sectors such as Aviation, Travel and Hospitality. An early look at our YoY hiring growth shows the rate falling below zero in the middle of last week (19th March) to a low of -2.8%, suggesting the beginning of a slowdown in hiring. Based on hiring trends we’re observing globally from countries that have implemented strict restrictions on travel and social gatherings, we expect the decline in hiring growth in Australia to accelerate and deepen in the coming weeks. Diving deeper into industries, we find that the YoY hiring growth of all Australian industries generally mirrors the overall country trend and has slowed in recent weeks. Of these, the Education, Consumer Goods and Travel industries have been hit the hardest. Severe hiring drops: These industries have been impacted by the pandemic through restrictions on travel and social gatherings. Such restrictions will significantly impact service sectors such as tourism, retail and F&B. The Education sector has also slowed down, likely due to travel bans affecting the return of foreign students. Education: -25.6% Consumer Goods: -11.7% Recreation & Travel: -10.8% Bucking the trend: These industries have shown a gradual increase in hiring over the past week. In the case of the Healthcare industry, there is likely a greater demand for healthcare professionals during this period. The Software and Finance industries are more likely to have more jobs that can work remotely. Finance: 10.3% Software & IT Services: 17.3% Healthcare:12.6% Looking further into the most common jobs postings for industries that are bucking the trend - these jobs require skills that are transferable between different roles, and includes roles such as: Customer Service Advisor - Skills needed: Retail Banking, Time Management, Customer Experience, Teamwork, Data Entry Customer Success Manager - Skills needed: Software as a Service (SaaS), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Account Management, Customer Engagement Business Development Manager - Skills needed: Account Management, Negotiation, Business Strategy, Marketing Strategy, Business-to-Business (B2B) Sales Development Representative - Skills needed: Software as a Service (SaaS), Lead Generation, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Account Management, Solution Selling There are also roles that require more specialized training, such as: Risk Manager - Skills needed: Stakeholder Management, Risk Assessment, Business Process Improvement, Change Management, Financial Services Business Analyst - Skills needed: Stakeholder Management, Requirements Gathering, Business Process Improvement, Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Agile Methodologies Software Engineer - Skills needed: Software Development, JavaScript, React.js, AngularJS, Amazon Web Services (AWS) General Practitioner - Skills needed: Medicine, Medical Education, Public Health, Healthcare Management, Emergency Medicine Nurse - Skills needed: Patient Safety, Basic Life Support (BLS), Healthcare Management, Acute Care, Patient Education Clinical Research Associate - Skills needed: Clinical Monitoring, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS), Clinical Trials, Electronic Data Capture (EDC) While it is clear that the hiring rate has declined, LinkedIn’s data also shows that the hiring rate has already started to improve in China, after the country followed aggressive containment efforts and saw progress in stemming the spread of the virus. Based on early trends in China, we are hopeful that economic activity can resume once the virus is contained. Over the coming weeks we will be sharing more data as it emerges, digging into more sectors and other countries to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the economy."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/march/this-week-s-roundup-march-27","date":"2020-01-26T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"This week: COVID-19 insights and resources","text":"Since the coronavirus emerged, LinkedIn, like many other organizations, has worked through how we protect our workforce, customers and communities.

We’re sharing his full post here as well: As countries around the world try to manage the impact of COVID-19 on their economies, LinkedIn's hiring rate (a measure of hires divided by LinkedIn membership) gives us early insight into how the labour market is responding and what might lie ahead. Last week, we published insights on how COVID-19 is impacting hiring in China and Italy, the two most impacted countries, and what that means in the U.S. We now have new insights on what the picture looks like for the UK and France. It’s clear that the hiring rate has declined across these European countries as the COVID-19 situation has become more serious in each country. However, LinkedIn’s data shows that the hiring rate has already started to improve in China, after the country followed aggressive containment efforts and saw progress in stemming the spread of the virus. We’ll continue to monitor our data there, and globally, to see what we can expect as the impact of the virus makes its way around the world. Below is a recap of what we are seeing across each of these countries (data covers the 7 days to March 21st). Both China and Italy showed a pattern that shortly after each country issued mandatory quarantines, national hiring fell sharply. China About two weeks after we saw hiring growth contract in China, it fell to a low of -45% YoY. Hiring has slowly started to rebound as containment of the virus takes effect, but it is still hovering at -24% YoY as people go back to work. Italy As Italy issued a mandatory lockdown earlier this month, hiring in the country also fell. Three days after the country went on lockdown, hiring growth dropped into the negative. And one week after the initial dip, hiring growth plummeted to a low of -40% YoY. It currently stands at -46%. United Kingdom Based on the hiring trends we’re observing in China and Italy, we anticipate that hiring growth in the UK will accelerate its decline in the coming days: ONS data published on Tuesday 17th March showed that, in January, the UK labour market looked robust: employment stood at a record high, unemployment was low and (real) wages had finally climbed above their pre-crisis peak. An early look at our daily hiring rate shows a slowdown is already happening, with the hiring rate falling below zero. We are however seeing some pockets of better news with some companies announcing new roles that are helping to mitigate the overall headwinds. In particular, Morrisons announced that it is creating 3,500 new jobs in the UK to help with the current scale of home delivery demand, and Co-op has created 5,000 new jobs for people who have lost jobs amid the coronavirus crisis. France In France, a strict lockdown started on Tuesday March 17th and, at the same time, hiring trends have started to mirror those observed in China and Italy, when those countries announced containment measures. We anticipate that hiring growth in France will continue its decline in the coming days. Before COVID-19 hit Europe, the France labour market looked robust with the unemployment rate falling under 8% in Q4 2019, the lowest since the end of 2008. Almost half of the decline in French unemployment since 2016 has occurred over the five quarters to Q4 2019, indicating that the labour market recovery was deepening."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/april/this-week-s-roundup-april-21","date":"2020-01-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"This week: COVID-19 insights and resources","text":"Since the coronavirus emerged, LinkedIn, like many other organizations, has worked through how we protect our workforce, customers and communities.

We’re sharing his full post here as well: The past several weeks have been difficult--and it appears we have a challenging road ahead. It’s also an enormously disorienting time with news changing by the minute. And as we navigate this inside of LinkedIn, we keep turning to our editorial team to help figure out which way is up. Dan Roth, LinkedIn’s Editor in Chief, and his team of 65+ editors, located across the globe and working 24 hours a day, are singularly focused on making sure what we publish is timely and accurate. Keeping up with real-time updates of high-quality content is something we take seriously and is our number one priority during this unprecedented time. So many companies are pointing to LinkedIn as a source of truth. And in a time when information is spreading so quickly and so erroneously, I’m proud of our team. When we hired Dan almost nine years ago and started talking about adding an editorial voice to the LinkedIn platform, we had no idea where we’d be today. We had huge ideas and big plans but wondered if what we were sketching on the white board would actually become a reality. Were we dreaming too big? Does our audience want this from us? We weren't and you do. Our members are turning to LinkedIn to find news they can trust and we take this responsibility seriously, particularly in times like this. We are using many tools and products to make sure we’re bringing you the most relevant and accurate content. As I mentioned last week, we’ve launched a ‘Special Report: Coronavirus’ box above ‘Today’s News and Views’ with storylines relevant to COV19. This offers reliable updates from experts such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and more. Content sourcing matters, which is why we’re promoting content from the most credible organizations and experts. The WHO is updating daily with live streams of their media briefings, tips to stay safe and healthy during the pandemic, and hosting real-time Q&As with experts, which is generating some of the highest views on LinkedIn Live. And the CDC is focused on sharing real-time reports and updates--and cutting down on the spread of misinformation. If you’re looking to stay current, the Daily Rundown is updated frequently and is a one-stop shop for all things COVID, and reaches 96 million people daily. And the regular Daily Rundown, the largest daily business publication, continues to give professional insights to millions of people a day. And if you haven’t tuned in to Business Unusual, I encourage you to check out the latest episode. It’s on four days a week and covers the key issues that we are all facing as professionals in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. These range from how CEOs are taking a leadership role to the reality of WFH with kids. We’re approaching this story very specifically: Covering the news, fostering conversations and getting them to the right audiences. We have human editors because having experienced journalists working with and alongside algorithms is a better solution than having either on their own. Our editors have the unique ability to put news and views in context. We like to say that ‘the story starts with the reader.’ In addition to making sure our Coronavirus coverage is reliable, our editors are spending a lot of time listening. To our members, to our influencers, to you. What are our members talking about? What are they interested in? We’re listening and surfacing trending topics and issues. Our members are sharing perspectives and advice on topics including remote working, social distancing, crisis management, business continuity, online learning and collaboration in record numbers. Our members are also talking about: small business owners, frontline workers, jobseekers. These stories give affected members a platform and resources to navigate their specific crises. Another example, this running tracker of corporate responses has been invaluable for business leaders and employees alike. We are also tracking trends in the conversation. For example, France has the highest percentage of posts discussing COVID-19, while Brazil has the fastest growth in COVID-19 discussions. Stay tuned as we continue to look for insights in the data to help provide our members as much clarity as possible in such an uncertain situation. Investing in our editorial team was a decision we made years ago and as I’ve heard from members and business leaders how much the content they are curating has helped during this time, I’m glad we did. Stay safe and stay healthy this week. We’re #InThisTogether."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/march/joining-forces-to-help-fight-coronavirus","date":"2020-01-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"Joining forces to help fight coronavirus","text":"LinkedIn has joined forces with 24 other Bay Area companies to commit an initial $22M in collective funding for organizations on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis.

The headline? Empathy is the superpower that will help companies find the most value amid changing expectations from employees in an increasingly tight labor market. By looking at survey results from over 7,000 talent professionals around the world, behavioral insights on how people use LinkedIn, and conversations with some of the biggest brands, we were able to shed light on four trends that reflect the changing world of work: Employee Experience: Companies are starting to work for employees and prioritize their needs - not the other way around. Nearly all (96%) HR/TA leaders say creating a great experience for their employees is becoming more and more important, not only for retention but for their bottom line. Now, walking a mile in an employee’s shoes means moving beyond feedback to active listening, collaboration and change. This shift in focus is reflected on the platform too: there has been a 2.4X increase in LinkedIn members whose job titles include \"employee experience\" since 2014. Despite this progress, with only 52% of HR/TA leaders saying their company provides a positive experience, there’s a good amount of work left to be done when it comes to designing great employee experiences. People Analytics: Data is now accessible to all, and understanding and capitalizing on analytics is quickly becoming a must-have skill in HR. Three fourths (73%) of talent leaders say embracing people analytics will be a major priority for their company over the next 5 years. Data can tell a story and while its power was previously accessible to only the largest companies, it has recently become more democratized, understandable and available. Our platform’s data supports this: we’ve seen a 242% increase in HR pros with data analysis skills during the past 5 years. Internal Recruiting: Talent professionals are rediscovering a key talent pool. When it comes to internal hiring, our research found a +10% increase in internal hiring since 2015 and three-fourths (73%) of talent leaders say internal recruiting is increasingly important to their company. Better retention may be why: employees at companies with high internal hiring stay 41% longer compared to those with low internal hiring. Multigenerational Workforce - Later retirements and the arrival of Gen Z prompts companies to embrace age diversity in the workforce. An overwhelming number of talent pros (89%) say a multigenerational workforce makes a company more successful, and 56% have recently updated policies to appeal to all ages. When it comes to differences across generations, we found subtle differences in what motivates employees, makes them leave, and retention trends. For example, Baby Boomers tend to stay 18% longer than the average employee (almost 2x longer than Millennials). Tapping into these four trends will not only help attract in-demand talent, but keep great talent amid increasing expectations of what employers owe to their people. In the 2020s, operationalizing empathy will help you succeed. Read more about the findings here. Methodology: We surveyed more than 7,000 talent professionals in 35 countries, looked at LinkedIn behavioral data generated from the billions of data points created by more than 660 million members in over 200 countries, and conducted interviews with experts to create our annual Global Talent Trends report for 2020, which looks at four trends that reflect the increasing expectations of what employers owe to their people, and provides data-driven recommendations on how to act on these trends.

We’re sharing her full post here as well: Countries around the world are in different stages of managing COVID-19, and we are beginning to gain an understanding of how economies are responding to the sudden disruption of the pandemic. LinkedIn's hiring rate gives us early insight into how the labor market is responding and what might lie ahead for those who are just beginning to feel the impact of COVID-19. We also know from conversations on LinkedIn that some companies have been adapting interview processes that may slow the time-to-hire, while we may see others delay start dates for the time being. As we looked at our hiring data in two of the most impacted countries -- China and Italy -- we noticed a pattern. Shortly after each country issued mandatory quarantines, national hiring plummeted. About two weeks after we saw hiring growth contract in China, it plummeted to a low of -45% YoY. Hiring has slowly started to rebound as containment of the virus takes effect, but it is still hovering at -26% YoY even as people go back to work. In Italy, we saw a similar trend: three days after the country went on lockdown, hiring growth dipped below zero. And one week after the initial dip, hiring growth plummeted to a low of -40% YoY. Based on the hiring trends we’re observing in China and Italy, we anticipate hiring growth in the U.S. will begin to show a similar sharp decline as soon as next week. A preview of our monthly hiring rate shows a slowdown as major cities like Seattle, New York and San Francisco mandate social distancing policies, and many companies in the U.S. that are able to are moving their workforces remote. Initial claims for unemployment insurance, the earliest publicly available labor market indicator in the U.S., also surged by 70K the week of March 8-14, reaching their highest level since September 2017. Based on early trends in China, we’re hopeful that economic activity can resume once the virus is contained. With China’s hiring numbers beginning to move in a positive direction, we’ll continue to monitor our data there, and globally, to see what we can expect as the impact of the virus makes its way around the world. I've shared more about what this snapshot of the labor market might mean in a conversation with LinkedIn Editor George Anders.

People coming together physically is how the virus we’re fighting spreads, and coming together virtually is one of the ways we’ll beat it. Beating it isn’t just stemming the disease’s spread, it’s taking care of our loved ones and peers, those in need and on the front lines, our businesses and our economy. Many of our customers have asked us to share how LinkedIn has approached managing this crisis, and in the spirit of sharing any information that might be useful to others, here’s what we’re doing, what we’ve learned, and how we’re thinking about the path ahead. Executive Cycles Required At the onset, we spent several long sessions together as an executive team that ended up being a critical investment in codifying how we would make decisions and manage the situation in the coming days and weeks. That first meeting turned into three daily executive standup meetings. We met at 10am, 3pm and 8:30pm every day and included our regional Managing Directors to be sure a global perspective informed our decisions. As we’ve built more processes, we’ve been able to move to a single daily stand up, adding others as needed. Every stand up includes a check in on our employees and on each other, as this is a human issue first. Having complete alignment across our leadership team and every function at the company has proven invaluable. Codifying Guiding Principles Very quickly we realized the importance of having a framework for every decision we were making. Repeatedly, we go back to these principles when we’re managing a new and challenging situation: Protect our workforce: Solve for both the physical and mental well-being of our workforce, while supporting our broader global community. Start all decision-making with the facts Partner with our industry peers and learn from one another: Numerous peers have helped and we have the benefit of being a part of Microsoft and having access to their experts. Ensure business continuity: Support our members and customers and minimize disruption to our day-to-day business operations and performance. Establishing a Global IMT Every one of our regions and offices has an Incident Management Team (IMT). Local IMT’s include a representative from HR, legal, communications, facilities, security, and the country or office leader. They’re trained and empowered to mobilize to manage local issues. The APAC IMT, for example, managed the situation for our offices in China and did an incredible job, keeping our headquarters in the U.S. updated. As the virus spread to more countries, we had more local IMTs making decisions. We quickly felt the challenge of managing the different details and having consistency in our decision making. We had never needed a Global IMT, but spun one up immediately. We also made sure the people who would be running the Global IMT for the duration of the COVID-19 issue were fully dedicated and their full time jobs were backfilled. The Global IMT is now responsible for maintaining a running list of all our offices, current status and impacts, and local health guidelines. They also play point on coordinating with the local IMTs, experts and local health officials. They join every executive stand up as the source of truth for us. Creating a Consistent Language The Global IMT has helped us create definitions and frameworks for each of our locations. We’ve developed a Green, Yellow and Red status for each office, with clear definitions. This enables us to be consistent in how we communicate with our workforce and how we manage our workplaces. Supporting Our People This is our first priority. As we’ve moved to most of our workforce working from home, we’ve had to manage supporting employees who don’t have the right set ups to work remotely, parents with kids who will be home, employees with visa challenges, and more. We also joined Microsoft in guaranteeing we’ll pay our hourly workers who support our facilities whether they work or not. And we recognize that mental well being is a very real issue. We’ve extended our mental health support services globally and set up virtual mindfulness situations. This will be our ongoing focus in all we do. Communicating Often and Transparently We don’t know any other way, but a direct and consistent drumbeat of communications has proven particularly important and our employees have been incredibly grateful. We’ve learned that in these times of uncertainty, our teams really want clarity and direction, and we’ve opted to over-communicate to maintain trust. Arming Our Managers A critical key to taking care of our workforce, our members and our customers has been ensuring our managers have the information they need to help manage through a very challenging time. We’ve held regional manager Q&A sessions, with hundreds of managers attending each one, and are moving those to a regular weekly cadence. Given we’re likely in this new normal for some time, as we look ahead, we’re focused on: Coming together as a company Our culture is, and will be our north star during this crisis. It’s manifested itself in so many ways, from an employee in Dublin hosting a virtual concert for our team in Milan who have already been working from home for a number of weeks, to a virtual town hall for our Asian Alliance employee resource group as some are encountering xenophobia during this time. Ensuring business continuity While the distractions are real, supporting our members and customers is one of the most important things we can do right now. Moving forward virtually Next week, we’ll do our first all virtual company all hands for 16,000 employees. We’ve also onboarded our first class of new hires and our Talent team has moved all interviewing virtual. We’ve made a number of LinkedIn Learning courses focused on working virtually available for free to everyone. We’ve also shared how to sell virtually and will continue to share anything we think can help. Building in contingency It’s clear we won’t have a break from this soon and the teams who have been working around the clock need help and support. We’re quickly working to ensure we have the right infrastructure in place to support a fully remote workforce and support plans for all the key functions and people leading the work and the business. Mobilizing employees to help We believe our platform can play a unique role in supporting professionals everywhere during this period and we’re accelerating the work every we can do to help coach others. While the challenges and hours managing this situation are significant, what we learn will benefit our companies for years to come. With that said, more than anything, we hope the moves being made around the globe will quickly stem the spread of the disease to save lives and help those suffering economically find relief. If you have anything you’ve seen work well in your organizations that will benefit us all, please share — we’ll get through this together."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/march/covid-19-joint-industry-statement","date":"2020-01-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"COVID-19 joint industry statement","text":"LinkedIn has joined Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Reddit, Twitter and Youtube in a joint industry statement on COVID-19. “We are working closely together on COVID-19 response efforts.

The world of work is changing rapidly, and leaders need to adapt their own skills and mindsets to address future trends and challenges. Our findings show that while leaders may feel they’re prepared, their employees aren’t so sure, and often feel more confident in their own adaptability. Technology and rapid pace of change will require leaders to learn new skills. When it comes to the leading trends leaders need to keep in mind, respondents viewed artificial intelligence (59%), pace of change (36%), and customer demands and expectations (32%) as most important things to address. Ethics and transparency also ranked highly as a trend impacting leaders, with nearly a third citing this (30%), underscoring the importance of trust and transparency in the era of digital disruption. Employees feel they’re taking more definitive action to prepare for these trends. More than 50% of respondents stated they are “definitely” taking steps to prepare, while 56% noted their leadership is only “somewhat” prepared. //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2020/january/future-of-leadership','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'t5_b1MJ37tI'); //]]> Leadership that prioritizes people, purpose, and agility will come out ahead. 55% of respondents indicated a purpose driven and caring mindset was the number one thing leaders should be striving for, followed by embracing technology (47%), and agility and nimbleness (46%). Given that estimates note one-third of the U.S. workforce will need to enter new occupational categories by 2030, this agility and willingness to embrace change will be critical. A purpose-driven mindset will be critical to hiring and retaining new talent. We’ve seen this trend before, purpose is a driver of engagement based on data by Glint, a leader of employee engagement. We’ve also found that more than half (52%) of U.S. millennials prioritize “values” over a paycheck. Soft skills are more than a bonus, they’re table stakes. Leaders won’t just need to be purpose-driven, they’ll also need to be inspiring. When it comes to skills, more than half (51%) of respondents said leaders would need to know how to be motivated, engaging, and inspiring. Being emotionally intelligent (39%), and having listening and communication skills (34%) also topped the list, echoing recent research that found emotional intelligence is one of the most in-demand skills in the world. However, over half of respondents (51%) don’t think their leaders are currently practicing these skills well and are more likely to be confident in their own skills, with 68% indicating they believe they are practicing these skills “well” or “reasonably well.” Overcoming talent challenges is top of mind. Competition for top talent is tighter than ever, and attracting and retaining talent is the leading challenge leaders will need to address (45%). Professionals are aware their jobs are changing, noting that adapting to technological advancements and changes (44%), and reskilling or upskilling employees (40%) were the next biggest challenges. Respondents are not positive on the outlook of how prepared their leaders are to face these future challenges in the workplace, with 59% indicating “not well at all and “somewhat well”. However, respondents feel much more prepared than their leaders to handle these challenges, with 46% indicating “very well” and “reasonably well” to facing future challenges. Methodology: This survey was conducted in March 2019 on a survey sample of 14,000 global LinkedIn members and presented in aggregate. This research will be included in Jacob Morgan’s upcoming book, The Future Leader."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/march/this-week-s-roundup-march-13","date":"2020-01-12T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"This week: COVID-19 insights and resources","text":"Since the coronavirus emerged, LinkedIn, like many other organizations, has worked through how we protect our workforce, customers and communities.

We’re sharing his full post here as well: The world of work has changed dramatically in the last few weeks. The coronavirus epidemic has prompted people to seek trusted news sources and facts; companies to ask employees to work from home; organizations to cancel major events, from Mobile World Congress to SXSW; and industries, businesses and supply chains to face very real challenges. In times like these, we take our job as the world’s professional network very seriously. We’ve moved quickly to use our platform to bring trusted news and facts to members, like broadcasting WHO updates live daily; we’ve scaled our events platforms to enable companies to reach audiences virtually; and we’ve unlocked learning courses and resources that help professionals be productive and successful. Underlying everything, we remain the professional community that helps people adjust and thrive in a different normal. Our global team of 60-plus LinkedIn editors are curating news and perspectives about the coronavirus from trusted sources. This includes insights on the impact on the economy, how companies are responding, new policies that are being put in place, and best practices for people and companies adjusting how they work. We’ve also created a new section in the feed -- Trending News -- to feature reliable updates from experts, including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that is available in 54 countries and 9 languages. If you are using our search functionality to find information about the coronavirus, you’ll find a new trusted information section curated by our editorial team at the top of the page. All this information is also featured in the Daily Rundown we send to members in 96 countries in 9 languages. It’s an easy way for you to get top news of the day. We know people are looking for information on this dynamic environment and sharing how they’re adapting to it. Searches on LinkedIn for #WFH and #RemoteWork have increased significantly over the last several weeks. This is a great place to start if you’re looking for tips or best practices from your community on how to transition effectively from traditional office to a remote work setup. We’re also seeing organizations starting to use LinkedIn Live to share updates in real-time. We’ve seen companies take their in-person gatherings virtual, including Chanel, which streamed its runway show on LinkedIn Live, and the World Health Organization, which did it’s first LinkedIn Live Q&A on mental health. You can discover a live video stream from your homepage feed or through your notifications. We have 16 LinkedIn Learning courses available for free including tips on how to: stay productive, build relationships when you’re not face-to-face, use virtual meeting tools (Microsoft Teams, Skype, BlueJeans, Cisco Webex and Zoom), and balance family and work dynamics in a healthy way. We’ll keep moving quickly to make sure we are helping you get information you can trust and are able to stay connected to your community.

We’re sharing his full post here as well: We recently shared initial insights on how the UK labour market is being affected by COVID-19. We are now beginning to see the early impact of the pandemic on different industries in the UK, as demonstrated by the LinkedIn Hiring Rate. Our data shows that nationally - and across all industries - hiring growth in the UK has slowed since public health interventions were announced in March. While the data shows that this unprecedented situation has created incredibly challenging circumstances for a number of industries, there are sectors that have been able to weather the situation and are poised to continue hiring growth. At this stage, we’re seeing very clearly that some industries are more affected than others, and industries fall into three groupings: Responding industries: As businesses and the economy shift to a very different environment, the following industries have the highest hiring increases compared to this time last year: Transportation & Logistics: +6.9% Hardware & Networking: +5.6% Healthcare: +5.4% These industries are central to the pandemic response. For example, Hardware & Networking businesses are supporting the shift to remote work. The healthcare industry has shown hiring growth to cope with the increased pressure on the healthcare system, from treating patients and meeting the need for new equipment to tackle the virus. Weathering industries: A second category of industries, including Finance and Software & IT, have faced challenges but have managed through some of the changes. These industries have seen a smaller drop in hiring and, on the whole, have been more able to transition their workforces into remote roles. Some industries may have postponed hiring temporarily, but we expect there will be some stabilization as companies transition to remote hiring. That said, we will have to wait for the economy to restart before employment can go up again overall. The Retail industry has seen small growth driven by a number of supermarkets announcing major hiring plans. However, this has been offset by wider challenges for high street retailers, whose businesses have been harder hit by the pandemic. Retail: +2.2% Finance and Software & IT: between -2% and -5% Adversely impacted: These industries have been directly impacted by the pandemic, in part as a result of closures and event cancellations, and as such their hiring rates are around or well below the national average (-15%): Recreation & Travel: -47.1% Entertainment -25.8% Corporate Services -15.4% We will continue to monitor our insights during this crisis to provide some clarity on the impact to our labour market, and the lessons that we can learn from other countries as economies try to navigate their response. *All hiring rate % changes are year-on-year and calculated as of the week ending 27/3/2020. Our analysis looks at the year-on-year changes in hiring rate, which is a measure of hires divided by LinkedIn membership.

March is only the first month to truly capture the economic impact of COVID-19 in the U.S. Through April, I’m expecting we’ll continue to see a downward trend as the impact spreads from major coastal cities to other parts of the country. But looking at this month’s data, we already saw an immediate and significant impact on hiring. Our hiring rate in March was 1.1% lower year over year, which is the largest drop in LinkedIn’s hiring rate since January 2017. And looking at trends month-over-month, March hiring was 1.3% lower. Thus far, the decline in our U.S. hiring rate has not been as severe as what we've seen in Italy, France, and China which have instituted full nation-wide lockdowns. While we strongly suspect there are more challenging days ahead, there is a glimpse of hope: our hiring data in China continues to trend upward, giving us reason to believe that a hiring recovery can begin once public health restrictions start to lift. Other trends we’ve observed over the course of the month: The hardest hit industries are, not surprisingly, those dependent on close personal contact or affected by public health closures: Recreation & Travel (-22.2% M/M SA), Wellness & Fitness (-20.9%), Nonprofit (-20.6%), Education (-18.9%), Retail (-18.6%), and Entertainment (-17.8%). We’re also seeing a significant decline in industries where purchases of bigger ticket items can be delayed: Real Estate (-19.7%), Durable consumer goods (-19.7%). More resilient industries are on the frontlines of this pandemic, and are critical to supporting the rapidly-changing healthcare and infrastructure needs of the country. LinkedIn data also shows a spike in demand for workers in roles that are on the frontlines. We’re also seeing only slight dips in hiring rates across Software & IT Services (-0.8%), Public Safety (-1%), and Legal (-1.2%). This may be because many tech companies are now staffing up to support infrastructure for large remote workforces, or given the nature of the work employees can more easily work from home. The impact of the virus is also playing out differently in cities across the country. March hiring rates declined in all 20 of the cities we track, but slumped more than 10% month over month in four cities: Detroit, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and New York. Both Detroit and New York City are in states that have seen the most intense outbreaks of the pandemic so far, and Los Angeles’s dip may reflect its prominence in the entertainment industry. We also saw six cities where hiring has not yet taken as hard of a hit. Atlanta tops the list, with a decline of just 1.6% on the month in its March hiring rate. Cleveland, Seattle, St. Louis, Denver and Dallas also saw less than 3% slippage month over month. We continue to monitor the trends across cities and industries as we suspect that unfortunately there will be more impact to come. You can take a closer look at your industry and city in the full report, and get a better sense for what’s happening around the country in George Anders’ latest article."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/april/helping-fill-critical-jobs-on-the-front-line","date":"2019-12-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News"],"title":"Helping fill critical jobs on the front line","text":"Today, LinkedIn’s VP of Product, Tomer Cohen, shared a post about how LinkedIn is helping to fill critical front-line roles. We’re sharing his full post here as well: The global battle we are fighting with this pandemic has shone a light on our local heroes - from the doctors, nurses and medical professionals caring for our sick - to the growers, truckers, warehouse workers, and grocery staff all of whom keep our food and other critical supplies reaching us. As they work around the clock on our front lines, we are committed to doing everything we can to help their respective organizations find the people they need to meet the growing demand for these critical services. That’s why starting today, we are making a commitment to help these critical roles get filled as quickly as possible, starting in three key ways. First, we are enabling the sectors that have these urgent hiring needs to post jobs for free on LinkedIn. Hospitals and nonprofits working on Coronavirus disaster relief and essential services (such as supermarkets, package delivery and warehousing companies), can now post new mission critical jobs for free for the next three months. Members with relevant skills will discover these jobs through push notifications, real-time alerts, in the LinkedIn feed, and in job search. Organizations in these sectors can get started today. Second, we will drive the right talented people with the right skills to these roles by tagging critical frontline healthcare roles, such as doctors and nurses, as urgent and bringing them front and center on the LinkedIn homepage and in our jobs homepage. Finally, we realize that while our platform is the most scalable way to make these matches globally, we also know that talent professionals can help. Last week, we expanded our Recruiting For Good program to deploy our own team of recruiters to source and screen talent for organizations on the front lines so that these organizations can fill urgent paid and volunteer positions. Already more than 100 LinkedIn employees are participating in this program. We’ve also received a very positive response from healthcare providers and nonprofits that we are supporting, including the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region, and we're working quickly to expand globally. As part of these efforts earlier this week, we launched a campaign with the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region to source volunteers to distribute free, prepared meals to students and families impacted by school closures. On the first day alone, we were able to drive more than 2,000 members to visit their volunteer application page. If you need support with urgent hiring please submit a request via this form and we will reach out to determine how we can best partner together. These are a few ways that we believe we can help. And we’re not stopping here. We are committed to continuing to identify new ways we can support the fight against this global pandemic. The health and well-being of our global communities is our collective priority."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2019/january/new-linkedin-data-predicts-three-factors-that-make-employees-sta","date":"2019-11-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"New

The Index is a composite measure that seeks to understand how people perceive opportunity and more importantly, barriers that may prevent them from getting to those opportunities. The research surveyed over 11,000 respondents in nine markets in the Asia Pacific region - Australia, Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. Two rapidly developing markets in the region, Indonesia and India take the top two spots on LinkedIn Opportunity Index - driven by the people’s confidence in their economic growth potential, as well as their confidence in gaining access to and pursuing opportunities they identified as important. On the other hand, the more developed markets such as Japan, Hong Kong and Australia trailed in the Index as people in these markets expressed concerns over economic outlook, and generally felt more cautious about their chances of accessing and achieving success with opportunities that are relevant to them. Olivier Legrand, Managing Director, LinkedIn in Asia Pacific, said, “We believe that access to opportunity should be universal and for everyone. With the inaugural LinkedIn Opportunity Index, our aim is to gain an insight into the aspirations of people across the Asia Pacific region, how they feel about the opportunities they want to pursue, as well as the barriers that may stand in their way. The growing workforce in the region is a key asset that, if harnessed effectively, is going to continue to drive the economies. Over time, by tracking people’s perception of opportunity and the barriers they face, we hope we can continue to facilitate more of a balance between demand and supply in the opportunity marketplace.” Key Highlights of LinkedIn Opportunity Index 2018: Career advancement, entrepreneurship and learning opportunities matter to APAC, but less optimal finances and networks stand in the way Across APAC, there is strong desire to get ahead in life through advancing one’s career, building one’s own business and acquiring new skills. These are the top three opportunity areas for APAC, with each cited by about 15 percent of respondents. On the other hand, the top barriers people felt they needed to overcome in order to access and realise opportunities are one’s financial status (30 percent), followed by lack of a strong network and connections (22 percent). Other roadblocks include a difficult job market (19 percent), lack of required professional skills (18 percent) and lack of direction and guidance (18 percent). In fact, the top three cited barriers for aspiring and current entrepreneurs become more evident with higher percentages compared to all APAC respondents - one’s financial status (48 percent), lack of connection (28 percent) and fear of failure (21 percent). Interestingly, in Japan and the Philippines, factors that are more innate or psychological to people, such as fear of failure and lack of confidence ranked high as barriers to opportunities - almost a quarter of respondents put these barriers in second and third highest spots. APAC respondents believe diligence is the currency to get ahead in life While 90 percent of APAC respondents believe in working hard to get ahead in life, an almost equal number feel that knowing the right people or having the right connections (85 percent) and having equal access to opportunities (83 percent) are as important. Close on the heels of these factors are willingness to embrace change and level of education, both at 81 percent of respondents. 2 in 3 respondents in APAC feel “good luck” also play a part in getting them ahead in life. Within the region, people in Hong Kong (77%), Japan (76%) and Chinese Mainland (71%) feel most strongly about this. Work-life balance is an aspiration of how APAC respondents embark on opportunity A significant 40 percent of the respondents in APAC indicated that having good work-life balance as their ultimate aspiration of how they would embark on opportunity. This is strongly echoed by respondents in Singapore (48 percent), Australia (46 percent), Malaysia and the Philippines (both at 44 percent). More than 35 percent of the respondents also want to able to utilise their skills. 30 percent cite “learning a new skill” and 23 percent “learning a new technology” as their aspiration. In an environment where the prospect of being displaced from one’s job due to the impact of AI/automation and other shifts in the labour ecosystem, respondents also recognise that with jobs rapidly evolving, they need to upskill to stay relevant. In Indonesia and the Philippines, more than half of respondents consider “starting my own business” as their definition of opportunity. In contrast, respondents in Australia (13 percent), Hong Kong (13 percent) and Japan (7 percent) are least likely to embark on entrepreneurial ventures. In Singapore, only 24 percent of respondents want to start their own ventures. This demonstrates the thriving entrepreneurial culture and spirit amongst developing economies. Commenting on the Index, Dr Tan Ern Ser, Associate Professor of Sociology from National University of Singapore said, “Opportunity is essentially a means to an end, and as we have differing goals and aspirations in life, we would probably see the opportunities available to us from different perspectives and with different priorities. It’s also interesting that LinkedIn Opportunity Index revealed an underlying pattern: greater optimism from developing markets, and less from the developed markets. This raises the question, should developed markets therefore chase a ‘good-enough life’ rather than a ceiling-less good life? This question is quite pertinent as the study suggests that work-life balance is an aspiration for most people in APAC.” “The barriers to realising opportunities in life are very real, and despite the diversity of the Asia Pacific region, there are more similarities than differences when it comes to our hopes and aspirations. The good news is that no matter what opportunities mean for each one of us, we can count on our community for help. Whether it is learning a new skill, networking or sharing guidance, we can all help one another to unlock and create opportunities,” added Legrand. Note to editors LinkedIn commissioned independent market research firm, GfK to conduct this study between September and October 2018. The survey was conducted among 18 to 60 year olds across 9 markets via online interviews. The survey had more than 11,000 respondents. In total, there are seven factors that contributed to a composite measure of opportunity: Perceptions around opportunity: Availability of in-market opportunities Assessment on accessibility of opportunity Confidence in achieving success Perceptions around socio-economic and lifestyle factors: Outlook on economy over the next 12 months Outlook on respondents’ financial situation over the next 12 months Quality of life specifically happiness Quality of life compared to previous generation/parents The measures used in the survey, including the variables that made up LinkedIn Opportunity Index were identified through a series of interviews with a mix of young, mid-career and established professionals across Asia Pacific. The Index uses “100” as a baseline score for confidence. A higher score represents greater confidence from people living in a specific market. ### About LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the way companies hire, market, and sell.

This information, combined with the many other insights showcased on Pages, will help members stay up to date on companies they’re interested in or following. For job seekers, knowing funding information can help validate interest in a company as an employer. Sales and business professionals can also get a snapshot of a company’s trajectory to better prepare for any upcoming meetings or discussions.

We’re sharing his full post here as well: Our commitment to keeping LinkedIn a safe, trusted and professional community means that we regularly invest in new ways to prevent fake accounts or fraudulent activity on our platform. In May 2018, we restricted a number of fake profiles for violating our terms of service. Recently, through the application of a set of new tools, human review and intelligence from a variety of sources, including government agencies, we have determined that these fake profiles were created by suspected nation-state actors with an intent to spread information on LinkedIn. Specifically, 24 fake profiles we suspect were created by Russian nation-state actors, that were active and engaged in the sharing of politically divisive content from both ends of the U.S. political spectrum. Almost 80 percent of the content they shared received no comments or likes from other members and the remainder saw low engagement. Since our discovery, we have taken down all the shared content from these profiles. We continue to engage with the FBI and the U.S. Congress on this activity and are sharing our findings with industry peers. We will continue to enforce our policies, which are very clear: the creation of a fake account is a violation of our terms of service. We’re committed to keeping LinkedIn safe and will continue to invest in new methods to prevent, detect and mitigate fake profiles. We also encourage members to report any content they encounter that makes them uncomfortable. We take these reports seriously, and take action on content that violates our Terms of Service or Professional Community Policies."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2018/10/linkedin-talent-connect-2018","date":"2018-10-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"LinkedIn Announces new Recruiter platform, it's first ATS and new diversity insights at Talent Connect Conference","text":"Today at our ninth annual Talent Connect conference, we announced several new products and features to help talent leaders navigate today's digital transformation, against a backdrop of the growing skills shortage and fierce competition for talent and getting hired.

The data reveals how regulation, developments in technology and the EU Referendum vote have been key drivers impacting where and how people work in the sector. This month the report includes the results of an independent ‘Recruiter Sentiment’ survey that gauges UK based in-house and agency recruiters’ confidence in their ability to fill available roles. Other key insights include: Financial Services hiring more workers from others sectors, responding to regulation and technical change. Automation and regulation have led to changes to job roles in financial services, with sales and customer facing roles in the top five job roles experiencing the biggest decline in new hires during the past five years, while demand for legal and software job opportunities has increased. A greater share of financial services hires now come from other sectors, notably software and IT services, and Proffesional Services. Emerging technologies are driving demand for new skills, but supply is lacking. In a survey of over 600 HR professionals across the UK, over half (51%) have seen an increase in demand from financial services businesses to hire candidates with Artificial Intelligence (AI) skills over the past five years, a 49% increase in demand for cryptocurrency skills and 46% for blockchain. However, 55% of UK recruiters and hiring managers are struggling to fill rolls, saying there are a greater number of jobs than available candidates with the right skills. Less migration into the UK is leading to a greater share of finance jobs filled by UK educated workers. UK educated workers are taking a larger share of new financial services hires in recent years. The number of new hires in the Financial Services sector educated in the UK is rising, from 76.4% in 2013, compared to 78.6% in 2017. These insights are drawn from the data of more than 25 million LinkedIn members in the UK, which represents more than 70 percent of the working age population. The data shows the extent to which hiring is increasing or decreasing across the UK, its regions, and industries, and where workers are moving to and from. The report is a tool which is designed to be used by policy makers, business and individuals to support them in making informed economic decisions. Miles Celic, Chief Executive Officer, TheCityUK, commented on the findings: “Our industry has long thrived by embracing change and tackling challenges – qualities that have established the UK as one of the world’s leading international financial centres. But we can’t afford to stand still. New technology and digitisation is rapidly changing the industry to the point that the distinction between ‘tech’ firms and other businesses is less and less obvious. This means that more employers are looking for similar skills, vying for candidates already in short supply. “Being able to attract and retain the most talented people with the right skills from both the UK and overseas is a top priority for leaders across the financial and related professional services industries - and is a key area of focus for the Chancellor's Financial Services Skills Taskforce. It’s also a long-standing UK competitive advantage. It is vital that the UK remains open to global talent and that we continue to develop the talent and skills needed to grow the industry into the future.” Click here to read the full September LinkedIn UK Workforce Report.

Just three years ago, there was a national surplus of people with data science skills — an employer in Dallas or Atlanta who wanted to hire a data scientist had plenty of options since there were few local shortages. But as more industries turn to big data, the national shortage has grown to 151,717 people, based on employer hiring demand. The U.S. cities with particularly acute shortages are New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles. Other key insights: Summer of strong hiring continues through July ​– Nationally, across all industries, gross hiring in the U.S. was 4.6% higher than in July 2017. Seasonally-adjusted national hiring was up 0.5% in July from June 2018. The industries with the biggest year-over-year hiring increases in June were agriculture (26% higher); manufacturing (12.3% higher); and transportation & logistics (12% higher). Hiring in these sectors is running strong today, but they are also among the most vulnerable to a trade war escalation. Austin’s job market has never been hotter ​ – ​ In July, hiring in Austin, TX, was up 14.3% from last year. The strong job market is drawing people from all over the country, bringing Austin to #1 on our ranking of U.S. cities attracting the most workers. Austin’s thriving tech scene is a big magnet, as indicated by large skills shortages in development tools and data storage technologies. But the city also has severe shortages in non-domain-specific skills, such as oral communication and digital literacy.

Through a collaboration between LinkedIn, eCampusOntario and Ontario’s Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development (MAESD) more than one million postsecondary students, faculty and staff in Ontario can now access world-class learning content by Lynda.com. Lynda.com, a company acquired by LinkedIn, is now part of LinkedIn Learning, and helps anyone learn business, technology and creative skills to achieve personal and professional goals. By combining Lynda.com’s best-in-class content with LinkedIn’s data and insights into how jobs, industries, organizations and skills evolve over time, institutions and individuals in Ontario can better identify the skills they need to create new pathways to opportunity. This collaboration will: Support faculty development: Provide engaging career development and keep faculty up-to-date with training on the latest IT topics including networking and software development. Enable a more engaging flipped classroom: Modernizing the classroom with Lynda.com will enable faculty to supplement their curriculum with a mapped set of courses and videos that align with learning objectives. By assigning video tutorials and tools training as a prerequisite to classwork or as homework they can reserve class time for concept mastery. This gives students more flexibility to learn on their own time and on any device, which improves learning outcomes. Support teaching and learning: LinkedIn is mapping Lynda.com content to the skills and competencies that are the foundation of course curriculum and supporting faculty in assigning effective content to students. For example, faculty can assign a playlist of Microsoft excel functions to students and apply these skills during in class interactive case studies. Prepare students for the jobs of the future: By constantly updating learning content based on most in demand skills data from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph, which includes more than 560M+ professionals, 14M+ jobs, and 50k+ skills, students can be prepared for the future. Supporting quotes: “Learning takes all kinds of forms and can happen at any point in someone’s life or career,” said Mitzie Hunter, Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Development. “By working in partnership with both eCampusOntario and Lynda.com, we are excited to offer flexible online learning that will build Ontario’s talent advantage and help postsecondary students prepare for successful careers in this changing economy.” “The Ontario government’s mission to provide equal access and training required to build a rewarding career is aligned with our vision of creating economic opportunity for every person in the global workforce”, said Jonathan Lister, Vice President Sales Solutions and Country Manager, LinkedIn. “The government’s commitment to innovating in education and offering students the best of traditional teaching with the flexibility of online learning, will benefit the entire community at large, and help in our efforts to close the skills gap.” “Today’s announcement is very good news for our students and faculty members,” said, Patrick Deane, President and Vice-Chancellor McMaster University. “The expanded access to online learning content is a valuable complement to the high-quality teaching and learning that happens every day in our classrooms, labs and communities.” \"We are delighted to see LinkedIn joining together with eCampusOntario to deliver online content that can enhance and expand learning and skills development for more than one million Ontario college and university students,\" says Dr. Marilyn Herie, Vice President Academic and Chief Learning Officer at Toronto's Centennial College. \"LinkedIn's access to a global community of subject experts and working professionals allows students to tap into a world of knowledge to support their individual career goals.\" For more information, visit LinkedIn Learning with Lynda.com.

Instead, the cities gaining the most people are those rich in economic opportunities – with strong hiring and relatively affordable housing, according to the May LinkedIn Workforce Report. The U.S. cities gaining the most people are Denver, Austin, Seattle, Las Vegas, and Nashville, which each have tax burdens near the middle of the pack. Other key insights: Hiring strong and stable through April – In April, hiring across the U.S. was 19.8 percent higher than in April 2017. Seasonally-adjusted hiring, nationally, was 2.1 percent higher in April than in March 2018. The industries with the biggest year-over-year hiring increases in March were aerospace, automotive, and transportation (23.3 percent higher); financial services & insurance (22.2 percent higher); and manufacturing and industrial (17.3 percent higher). The U.S. needs 230,000 more people with marketing skills – Companies, large and small, need marketing to grow. Small businesses may not have resources for a full-time marketing hire, but they still need these skills—which range from social media and digital marketing, to market research and branding. Given how critical marketing skills are across sectors, we were surprised to find that the U.S. has a national shortage of 230,000 people with marketing skills. The San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and even New York City—the center of the advertising universe—have the greatest shortages of people with these skills.

Migration has been steadily falling since the UK voted for Brexit, and LinkedIn’s data reveals that the number of professionals arriving to the UK from the EU27 has decreased by 26 percent over the last year. This month the report includes the results of an independent ‘Recruiter Sentiment’ survey that gauges UK based in-house and agency recruiters’ confidence in their ability to fill available roles. Other key insights include: Fewer international professionals are moving to the UK. In addition to seeing a reduction in the number of EU27 professionals relocating to the UK, there has also been a reduction of 20 percent in the number of professionals migrating from the rest of the world to the UK over the last year. This is supported by the experiences of recruiters, as nearly a third (28 percennt) of recruiters believe that the UK has become less attractive to candidates from the rest of the world. London is the region most impacted by the Brexit vote. Since the referendum, the net inflow of EU27 talent into London has been declining – and now more people are leaving London to relocate to the EU27 than vice versa. This is substantiated by the experiences of recruiters in the capital, with 54 percent saying that it is having a ‘big’ or ‘huge’ impact on hiring. LinkedIn’s data has also revealed that domestic migration is not filling the gap left by the reduction in international talent. Hiring fell in 6 out of the 12 nations and regions in the UK. March saw an overall decrease in the number of hires made, continuing the downward trend since January. The overall rate was down 1.2 percent compared with February, with the North East, North West and Wales seeing reductions of -5 percent, -5 percent, and -10 percent respectively, perhaps a result of the heavy snowfall these regions experienced in March. London also saw a decrease for the second month in a row, down by a further 2 percent in March. These insights are drawn from the data of more than 24 million LinkedIn members in the UK, which represents more than 70 percent of the working age population.

Seasonally-adjusted hiring was 3.1 percent higher in March than in February 2018. Hiring has been slightly better through the start of 2018 than it was in the second half of 2017, but year-over-year comparisons will become more challenging as we move into spring, when hiring skyrocketed last year. In line with national hiring trends, the industries with the biggest year-over-year hiring increases in March were financial services and insurance (20.9 percent higher); aerospace, automotive, and transportation (19.0 percent higher); and manufacturing and industrial (18.8 percent higher). Notably, hiring seems to be slowing in the professional services industry: after a strong run in 2017, seasonally-adjusted hiring fell in February 2018, stayed flat through March and was only up 9.9 percent year-over-year – much less than the national average. Top destinations for grads looking to go green – The fastest-growing hubs for people skilled in renewable and sustainable energy, ecology and environmental science, and green building and construction are Greensboro-Winston-Salem, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Nashville. And the hottest hiring markets overall – where people with these same skills are most likely to get hired – are Raleigh-Durham, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Boston. So if you have environmental science skills and are looking for a job, these cities are a great place to start your search.

Just a few days before Equal Pay Day on April 10, GSUSA and LinkedIn are manifesting their shared commitment to equal opportunity in an invaluable new career resource that promotes girls’ and women’s empowerment, leadership, and advancement in the world. With the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2017 findings revealing that gender pay parity is still more than 200 years away, the two organizations are taking action to help tip the scales for women in the workplace. The Girl Scout Network invites the organization’s more than 50 million Girl Scout alums to connect with one another on The Girl Scout Network to enhance their career development. Anyone who was a Daisy, Brownie, or higher in Girl Scouts is an alum and is welcome to join—whether she was a Girl Scout Brownie for one year, or went through the whole program and earned her Girl Scout Gold Award. Millions of girls already benefit from being a part of Girl Scouts as they grow up, and this new community on LinkedIn will similarly offer support for female professionals. It will also allow alums the opportunity to share their experience with the next generation and join forces with like-minded women to effect change. With access to LinkedIn’s rich data and insights, GSUSA will aggregate key information from the public profiles of Girl Scout alums, such as: education, career fields, and leadership positions to identify trends, deficits, and opportunities for women in the workplace. This information will help Girl Scouts create relevant and impactful programs and experiences for girls, to both better prepare them to lead as professionals in the workplace and move the needle on gender parity in their respective fields. The collaboration marks the first time that GSUSA will have the ability to track the life experiences and success of Girl Scout alums using LinkedIn’s community of more than 546 million members. At present, stories about unequal and unethical treatment of women continue to populate headlines across the United States. The Girl Scout Network on LinkedIn will offer inspiring personal stories from girls and alums as well as ways to support and help prepare girls to lead. The page will also provide new and relevant statistics about female leadership to inform and energize female professionals in their careers to take the reins and be trailblazers in our country and the world. The Girl Scout Network will also provide a place for employers and human resource professionals to recruit women who possess both the hard and soft skills crucial to career success, such as complex problem solving, process skills, and teamwork and communication—all of which girls learn through Girl Scouts. In fact, Girl Scouts completed a grand total of 12.6 million skill-development programs over the past four years. Girl Scouting Works: The Alumnae Impact Study, a 2012 Girl Scout Research Institute report, also found that Girl Scout alums outperform non-alums in key economic indicators, including higher household incomes and higher socioeconomic statuses. And a 2014 Girl Scout Research Institute report found that 68% of alums attribute their success in life to Girl Scouts. “As the largest girl leadership organization in the United States, Girl Scouts is responding to the clear national need for strong leadership, pay parity, and a robust talent pool to meet our nation’s skilled labor needs,” said GSUSA CEO Sylvia Acevedo. “We are thrilled to align with LinkedIn to establish a network of tens of millions of Girl Scout alums. I encourage all Girl Scout alums to help fuel the talent pipeline and enhance their professional networks by joining the Girl Scout Network on LinkedIn.” “Being a Girl Scout opened my eyes early in life to what it means to be a leader and team player,” said Alyssa Merwin, vice president, Sales Solutions Americas, LinkedIn. “Now online communities like the Girl Scout Network will provide critical outlets for millions of girls and young women to continue benefitting from the power of this network as they navigate their careers. LinkedIn is proud to collaborate with Girl Scouts to advance a shared commitment to creating economic and workplace opportunity for all women using our LinkedIn Company Page platform.” Girl Scout alums include 76 percent of current female U.S. Senators, 67 percent of current female U.S. Governors, and every female U.S. Secretary of State. In addition, more than half of women leaders in business are Girl Scout alums. Girl Scouts’ legacy is one of girls and women supporting one another and effecting change through civic engagement. This collaboration is a logical next step for GSUSA, which prepares and mobilizes girls to make the world a better place. Girl Scout alums interested in joining should visit The Girl Scout Network and click “follow.” About Girl Scouts of the USA We're 2.6 million strong—1.8 million girls and 800,000 adults who believe in the power of every G.I.R.L.

He spared no effort in steering LinkedIn China forward smoothly and set a high bar and built a solid foundation to enable LinkedIn China to succeed in the long run.” Since July 2017, Francis Tsang has made significant contributions and achievements as interim president of LinkedIn China. Under his leadership, LinkedIn joined Tsinghua University to publish the China Digital Economy Talent Report in November 2017, indicating the official launch of LinkedIn’s Economic Graph in China. In addition, LinkedIn Innovation Centre in Shenzen was officially launched in December, with the aim of empowering the local government and enterprises with LinkedIn’s advantages in big data, global platform and LTS solutions. China is one of the most significant and strategic markets for LinkedIn. In the past year, LinkedIn China continued to make progress towards creating economic opportunity for its members in China, which is set to unlock the massive potential.

February also saw a fall in hiring, with the majority of regions and sectors seeing a decline in hiring rates compared to January. Other key insights include: The UK lost more overseas talent than it gained. A majority of the UK’s twelve nations and regions lost more talent than they gained overseas in February, marking a significant change on January, when nine out of twelve regions saw a net gain in international talent. Most notable is the decline in London, with the capital experiencing a net loss of international talent for the first time since the Workforce Report began. Hiring fell in 8 out of the 12 nations and regions in the UK. February saw an overall decrease in the number of hires made, compared to a strong start in January. The majority of regions and nations saw a fall in their hiring rate, with an average decrease of 2.5 percent across the country. Yorkshire and the Humber, Northern Ireland and the West Midlands were the regions that saw the largest declines in hiring. The majority of economic sectors saw a slowdown in hiring. The hiring rate in 11 out of 19 sectors saw a decline in February, with the public sector, including healthcare and education, seeing the largest falls in hiring. However, February did see some sectors buck the trend – with hardware networking and energy and mining enjoying growth of 20 percent and 14 percent respectively when compared with January. These insights are drawn from the data of more than 24 million LinkedIn members in the UK, which represents more than 70 percent of the working age population. The data shows the extent to which hiring is increasing or decreasing across the UK, its regions, and industries, and where workers are moving to and from. The report is a tool which is designed to be used by policy makers, business and individuals to support them in making informed economic decisions.

This reflects the significant momentum LinkedIn has experienced in the German-speaking region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) and our ambitions for future growth. It was back in 2011 that LinkedIn first established itself in region, with two million members and a small team of five employees in Munich. Fast forward to December 2017, and we hit a new high, reaching 11 million members in the German-speaking region. In addition to strong member growth, we’re also making great strides with our commercial business as the majority of DAX companies now use LinkedIn's solutions for recruitment, marketing, sales as well as LinkedIn Learning. Amongst our roster of clients are local and world leaders such as Munich Re, JENOPTIK Group, Sixt, Swarovski and Credit Suisse, as well as global SMEs as Carl Zeiss and Red Bull. To further fuel our local growth and help our members, clients and governmental institutions in the region realize economic opportunities, we will be opening our second German office in Berlin in the second half of 2018. This is a manifestation of the trust our members and clients grant us and of the dedication and passion with which our team is driving our advancement in the region. For the first time, we will open a second office in an European country. This not only pays tribute to the diverse and promising region, but will also give us the opportunity to serve our members and clients better from two local hubs. In making the decision to open the Berlin office, we conducted extensive research, which included evaluating several cities within Germany to invest in, and considering criteria such as local talent pool, culture and opportunity to scale. Berlin not only offers fantastic talent, but also great commercial opportunity and closeness to governmental institutions. Berlin is not only the capital of Germany but a city that boasts one of the most vibrant start-up communities in Europe. It’s a place where we will feel right at home. But let’s not forget about our location in Munich as the city offers us the perfect location to access not only Germany, but also Austria and Switzerland along with a rich cultural background and access to a sizable portion of the DAX 30 (German stock index) companies. There is a market potential of over 25 million professionals in the DACH-region. We firmly believe that this further expansion of our presence in Germany will accelerate our growth even further.

The annual ranking highlights the 50 companies that are most sought-after by professionals, based on proprietary LinkedIn data that examines billions of actions by more than 540 million professionals on LinkedIn. The 2018 Top Companies realize they must find new ways to woo professionals and set an example for the way corporate America treats employees. Among the themes emerging: Purpose over perks: Foosball tables and all-you-can-eat cafeterias lose their appeal if workers cannot get the job done. Amazon (No. 1) attracts top talent by offering a corporate infrastructure that enables employees to see the impact of their work on a broad audience by not delaying launches with internal processes — even if employees need to find a vending machine for a snack. Diversity pipeline: Top Companies are testing bold tactics to build a diverse workforce. Oracle (No. 9) opened a charter high school on its campus to invest in STEM-based education, and Box (No. 44) eliminated four-year degree requirements to focus on hiring candidates for their skill sets over their degrees. Rethinking corporate healthcare: Employee health is top of mind for these companies, and they are breaking the corporate mold. Amazon (No. 1) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (No. 18) are part of a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway to develop a new healthcare company that aims to cut costs and improve coverage for employees. Apple (No. 6) is reportedly working on primary care clinics for employees that are expected to be at the forefront of combining technology with care. Here is what the highest ranked LinkedIn Top Companies are doing to attract and keep top talent: Amazon (No. 1) now offers to prepay 95% of tuition, textbooks and fees for its employees to receive training in \"professions of the future.\" Alphabet’s (No. 2) newest offices include sky-high dog parks, indoor fire pits and bouldering walls. Facebook (No. 3) extended its bereavement leave policy last year to up to 20 days, a policy developed after Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg suddenly lost her husband. Salesforce (No. 4) does continuous audits of its salary data and has spent $6 million trying to ensure equal compensation across gender and race. Tesla (No. 5) has a carpool program that allows employees to drive a Tesla to work. Apple (No. 6) offers its employees a 25 percent discount on the company’s devices. Comcast NBCUniversal (No. 7) employees get complimentary access to Universal theme parks, discounts on resorts and early access to NBCUniversal movies and TV shows. The Walt Disney Company (No. 8) made an initial investment of $50 million at the beginning of the year in an ongoing education program specifically designed to cover tuition costs for hourly employees. Oracle (No. 9) recognizes its developers as inventors and creators of “world-changing tech” and encourages them to file patents.

The findings, based on a new analysis of more than half a billion LinkedIn member profiles, show that the tech, retail, and media sectors are seeing the highest turnover rates, while the average turnover rate for all companies around the world is 10.9 percent. Here are highlights from the report: Tech: In 2017, the tech software sector saw the highest talent turnover rate in front of retail, media and professional services, coming in at 13.2 percent. This is the first time in three years that tech took the “top” spot in terms of highest turnover rate. Retail: Employees in the retail and consumer sector are turning over at high rates, with industries such as restaurants (17.2 percent), retail (16.2 percent), and sporting goods (14.8 percent) experiencing the most attrition. Media: With media and entertainment, newspapers (13.3 percent), online media (13.2 percent), and sports (13.2 percent) are all neck-and-neck in terms of what industries are driving the turnover rates. While every industry has unique drivers motivating its workforce, our research has found that the No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is lack of opportunity. Emphasizing career advancement can help retain current employees and attract new ones. With the right data, recruiters can get ahead of impending, unwanted turnover. Knowing who’s likely to leave and how valuable that talent is relative to the pool of professionals can make a big difference in keeping those star players.

Hiring in the aerospace, automotive and transportation industries saw the biggest year-over-year increases, followed by architecture and engineering, and financial service and insurance. Seasonally adjusted hiring was down nearly 9 percent month-over-month from January, bringing hiring back to the still-elevated levels we saw in the second half of 2017. Other key insights: Growing cities need teachers – When a city’s economy booms and attracts new residents, it creates a corresponding demand for teachers to educate the growing community. In fast-growing cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, Raleigh-Durham, and San Antonio, which are expanding rapidly from migration inflows, demand for teachers is growing quickly – and supply is, too. In cities with net migration outflows, like Cincinnati, Hartford, and Milwaukee, both supply and demand growth for teachers are notably weak. In Oklahoma City, where low pay for teachers has been a hot-button issue in recent years, demand for teachers is starting to pick up. Banks are hiring, but it’s not only where you’d expect – With the stock market reaching historic heights over the past year, we wanted to see whether there were any related trends in the jobs market for trading and investment skills. Unsurprisingly, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles – the country’s biggest cities and financial centers – take the lead for most people hired with trading and investment, risk management, and financial planning skills. But in terms of growth, the cities with the fastest-growing hiring markets for the same skills are Kansas City, Salt Lake City, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio, and Austin.

The findings show that talent developers are increasingly being asked to play a central role in strategic workforce planning. Through interviews with industry experts, the report also details a more holistic view of modern workplace learning, and the challenges that HR professionals face in today’s ever-changing world of work. To view the full report click here. Here are some of the key findings: 1. As the shelf life of skills shrinks, business leaders worry that talent developers are focused on training for today’s skill demands, at the expense of preventing tomorrow’s skill gaps. Our research shows that in 2018, talent developers are prioritizing the employee development needs of today. Yet, executives and people managers say that talent development leaders should prioritize identifying the skills that will be most important to build for the future. Savvy talent development leaders will find balance in their efforts to support the employees of today and tomorrow. 2. The number-one training priority in 2018 is soft skills. Each group in our survey – from executives to managers to talent developers – identified ‘training for soft skills’ as the number-one priority for talent development in 2018. In the age of automation, maintaining technical fluency across roles will be critical, but the pace of change is fueling demand for adaptable employees who are critical thinkers, communicators and leaders. 3. Talent developers are depending more on online learning solutions to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse, multi-generational workforce – and there’s no turning back. Fifty-eight percent of employees prefer opportunities to learn at their own pace, 49 percent prefer to learn at the point of need. Talent developers know that they need to rely on digital learning solutions to cater to varied learning needs. A recent ATD report found that almost 90 percent of companies offer digital learning today. Our survey shows that talent developers depend more on online learning solutions than ever before—not only to deliver content, but to measure learning success. 4. Employers should meet employees on platforms they are already using to align their on-the-job needs and professional aspirations. Each group in our survey identified ‘getting employees to make time for learning’ as the number-one challenge facing talent development in 2018. Yet, 94 percent of employees say that they would stay at a company longer if it invested in their career development. The modern organization needs to meet learners where they already are – aligning development opportunities with employee aspirations, and engaging them through the platforms where they are already spending their time. 5. Manager involvement is a critical ingredient to increase employee engagement with learning. Fifty-six percent of employees say that they would spend more time learning if their manager directed them to complete a specific course in order to gain or improve their skills. Talent developers name “increased manager involvement” as the number-two challenge they face. Getting managers more involved in employee learning is not the only way to see increased learner engagement, but data shows it will likely make an impact. For example, 56 percent of employees said they would spend more time learning if their manager recommended courses to them."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2018/2/february-workforce-report--manufacturing-drives-robust-january-h","date":"2018-02-07T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Economic Graph"],"title":"February Workforce Report: Manufacturing drives robust January hiring","text":"Hiring across the U.S. in January was higher than it has been since May 2017, with the manufacturing sector seeing the biggest year-over-year growth, according to the February LinkedIn Workforce Report.

Seasonally-adjusted hiring for accountants in January was up 16.3 percent from December, compared to 10.9 percent nationally. This spike is likely attributable to the new tax bill, as the rise in demand goes beyond what is expected for the start of tax season alone. The cities with highest demand for accounting skills are Austin, Seattle, Norfolk, Raleigh-Durham, and San Francisco. Las Vegas economy maturing beyond entertainment and hospitality industries – Since February 2017, Las Vegas has risen from No. 9 to No. 4 on our list of cities gaining the most workers. This growth in people moving to Las Vegas represents a 44 percent increase compared to a year ago. So what’s driving this rapid expansion? The local economy is growing fast, the cost of living is relatively low, and, of course, Nevada has no state income tax. The skills with the most increased demand are software modeling and process design, farm and agriculture, immigration law, electronic and electrical engineering, and pet care and services. 2018 is off to an incredibly strong start for hiring – In January, hiring across the U.S. was 13.0 percent higher than in January 2017. Seasonally-adjusted hiring was 10.9 percent higher in January than in December 2017— making January 2018 the strongest month for hiring since May 2017. While it is too early to tell if this hiring spike is attributed to increased confidence from the new tax bill, the industries with the biggest year-over-year hiring increase in January were manufacturing and industrial (15.5 percent higher); aerospace, automotive, and transportation (13.2 percent higher); and financial services and insurance (12.5 percent higher).

The hiring rate in December 2017 was 4 percent lower than the month before, suggesting that the U.K. ended 2017 with a slowing labour market. Other key insights: Hiring fell in 10 out of the 12 nations and regions in the UK. The North East saw the largest decline, with the hiring rate down 17 percent. While the hiring rate didn’t decrease in London and the South East, the regions reported static or near-static month on month figures, changing by 1 percent and 0 percent, respectively. The hiring rate in most economic sectors slowed. The month on month hiring rate fell in 14 of 19 reported sectors — with the most significant declines seen in the retail, legal, and consumer goods sectors. Bucking the trend, the energy and mining sector maintained strong growth with its hiring rate up 31 percent in December 2017 compared to December 2016. Other sectors that performed well include software and IT services, entertainment, and media and communications — which continued their steady growth the last three months. London remains the most attractive destination for talent. Looking at professional migration, nine out of 12 U.K. regions and nations gained more talent from overseas than they lost. Only Northern Ireland, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber saw a net loss of talent overseas. London remains the most attractive destination for international and domestic migration, although Scotland overtakes it in terms of the proportion of its new arrivals coming from abroad. These insights are drawn from the data of more than 23 million LinkedIn members in the U.K., which represents more than 70 percent of the working age population. The data shows the extent to which hiring is increasing or decreasing across the U.K., its regions, and industries, and where workers are moving to and from.

Worth, and Cleveland-Akron surpassed the national average, and blew past hiring growth rates in big cities like New York City, Seattle, or San Francisco. Compare Houston’s 14.6 percent growth in hiring to the national U.S. average of 10.4 percent, or Washington, D.C.’s modest 3.5 percent. Hiring growth doesn’t always mean migration growth – Houston, Phoenix, and Dallas-Ft. Worth are all outperforming the country in terms of hiring growth. But rapid growth in hiring rates doesn’t immediately translate to more people moving to these cities. For example, Houston is losing workers to petroleum-rich Odessa-Midland, likely due to the rebound of the oil and energy sector there.

The findings reveal that the recent boom in British jobs has been interrupted. Further key insights include: The slow down was not limited to a single region, but affected the entire country, with hiring tate declining month on month in every region. The key urban economic regions of London, the West Midlands, The East Midlands and the North West all saw similar declines in the November hiring rate, the first three down 9 percent, and the last down 10 percent respectively. Meanwhile, Scotland saw the smallest fall in November’s hiring rate when compared to October — down just 5 percent. The top hiring sector in scotland was energy and mining, so the smaller fall could be linked to new hires within the businesses focused on North Sea oil and gas Just one sector reported an increase in its November Hiring Rate compared to October. IT hardware and networking was the only sector to see a rise, of 3 percent. Some of the smallest declines were seen by the legal and finance sectors, whose monthly hiring rate decreased by 1 percent and 6 percent respectively. London continues to draw in the most professionals, both domestically and internationally. The report’s migrational data indicates that London continues to draw in the most professionals, as the foremost region to gain net recipients both internationally and domestically followed by the South West and North West, respectively. The North West, Northern Ireland and the South West have gained the most in domestic migration over the last 12 months after London, which leads significantly on this measure, while 10 of the 12 UK regions were net recipients of international migration and only Northern Ireland and the North East saw a loss.

Incorporating results from The Adecco Group’s Global Satisfaction Survey and LinkedIn’s global data analysis of more than 4 million members, across 38 countries, who have self-identified as contractors, the report provides data and insights to help recruiters and hiring managers inform future strategies. Here are some of the key findings: Flexible employment opens the door to hire more senior professionals – Most contractors (91 percent) are in their middle to late careers, and on average, work in higher seniority roles sooner -- more than a year, on average -- than peers in non-contract roles. Independent professionals are choosing flexible work as a lifestyle -- The majority (54 percent) of those involved in flexible work say that they are doing so in order to pursue their own particular interests. The top motivation among this group was that it is a stepping stone to a full-time position in their chosen field, which also skewed highest among Millennials. Independent professionals are consistently open to new opportunities -- According to LinkedIn data, contractors across these countries are 2.1 times more likely to view a job on LinkedIn than the average member (and 84% have done so over the past year).

Skills shortages have intensified the most in Salt Lake City, San Antonio, and West Palm Beach. Skills abundances have intensified the most in Raleigh-Durham, Columbus, and Boston. And the cities where skills gaps narrowed the most over the past year are Oklahoma City, Greenville, and Jacksonville. Read on for the skills in shortage and skills in excess in each of these cities. Yes, Americans are still moving — Seattle, Denver, and Austin consistently topped our list of cities gaining the most people in 2017. Denver climbed from No. 3 in January to No. 1 in November, representing a 5 percent increase in arrivals and displacing Seattle from the top spot. We also saw Las Vegas move from No. 9 to No. 5 over the course of the year, representing a 37 percent increase in arrivals. Of cities losing the most workers, Hartford continues to see a decline: from No. 2 in cities losing the most people in January to No. 1 in November, Hartford’s outflows have increased 5 percent since the start of the year. Other cities which have lost workers throughout 2017 seem to be improving their retention: Providence, which fell from No. 1 in net outflows in January to No. 2 in November, has seen a 19 percent decline in outflows, and Baltimore, which fell from No. 7 to No. 8 in the same period, has seen a 27 percent decline in outflows.

The report, Right people, wrong place?, ties into a key shift we’re seeing in the industry — a focus on Talent intelligence, which is a new way to use data and insights to improve every step of the recruitment process. Here’s a look at the findings: Companies are putting people in the wrong places. Most companies tend to concentrate talent in their headquarter country or in legacy locations, rather than building a presence in countries with current and future revenue opportunities. For example, consumer products and retail (CPR) firms are overrepresented in the U.S. relative to the market size. Companies that more closely match their people with business opportunity have better financial outcomes. Research found that when a company’s workforce is located in areas of greatest market opportunity, financial outcomes improve. In the pharmaceutical sector, for example, a typical company that increases its talent-to-market alignment by 10 percent could realize a $77 million increase in profit (EBITDA). The research also found that companies that increase talent-to-market alignment over time tend to grow faster. Economies where more companies match people to opportunity are more productive. U.S. companies tend to have the closest match between the location of their workforce and market opportunity in that sector. However, there’s room for firms headquartered in Europe and Asia to improve the match between their workforce and future prosperous markets. The full report is available here. Methodology The research in Right People, Wrong Place? is based on combined analysis of 659 companies across 11 sectors. A five step core methodology was followed using unique datasets on market size and company performance by industry sector developed by EY and also using aggregate profile data provided by LinkedIn on company workforce locations and distribution by self-reported seniority and function."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2017/11/linkedin-partners-with-tsinghua-university-to-publish-the-china-","date":"2017-11-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["APAC","Economic Graph"],"title":"LinkedIn partners with Tsinghua University to publish the China Digital Economy Talent Report","text":"The strength of the Chinese economy and the integration of technology into traditional industries have become important new driving forces of China’s economic growth, with digital talents critical to China’s digital transformation. To help the government and the industries be more informed about digital talents, the Tsinghua SEM Center for Internet Development and Governance (CIDG) collaborated with LinkedIn to publish the first-ever China Digital Economy Talent Report. Based on LinkedIn’s Economic Graph, the report runs a detailed analysis on Chinese professionals’ employment experiences, professional skills, and talent flows over the past three years, and concludes with advice for China’s talent strategy as it pertains to digital skills. President Xi Jinping reported at the 19th CPC National Congress that the real economy is the next-step focus of economic development, and that the integration between the internet, big data, artificial intelligence and the real economy should be strengthened. Professor Yubo Chen, head of the CIDG noted: “The continuous development of the Chinese economy’s digital transformation positions digital talents as the core competency to generate innovation-driven development and company transformation. The digital talents here are not only defined as those with ICT (information and communications technologies) expertise, but trans-disciplinary talents with complementary skills for ICT. More specifically, we categorized digital talents consists into six types according to the various requirements of the transformation of the value chain, which are digital strategy management, deep analysis, research and development, advanced manufacturing, digital operation and digital marketing and conducted systematic research about the status quo and trend of the demand and flow of digital talents in the whole country and in different regions.” Shifting from “the age of mobile internet” to “the age of intelligence,” digital technologies continue to promote the evolution of industries beyond ICT, as well as bringing transformative changes to the labor market overall. “To respond to questions such as the number of digital talents and what kinds of talents are in severe shortage, LinkedIn worked with CIDG in a research about Chinese digital talents based on the Economic Graph, which includes talent profile and talent flow trends,\" said Francis Tsang, Head of International Engineering and Interim President at LinkedIn China. \"The research provides government overall suggestions for scientific talent support strategies, which aim to train future-oriented and digital talents that reflect the times.\" Introducing LinkedIn’s Economic Graph //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/11/linkedin-partners-with-tsinghua-university-to-publish-the-china-','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'2BwZa1Y9z0s'); //]]> LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional network, with more than 530 million members globally. In China, LinkedIn now has more than 36 million members. And today, LinkedIn is launching the Economic Graph in China. LinkedIn’s Economic Graph is a digital representation of the global economy based on data generated from 530 million members, 50,000 skills, 18 million companies, 11 million open jobs, and 29,000 educational institutions. Through mapping every member, company, job, and school, LinkedIn data can uncover trends like talent migration, hiring rates, and in-demand skills by region. By partnering with governments and organizations around the world to share these insights, LinkedIn works to connect people to economic opportunities. International organizations such as The World Bank and the World Economic Forum have already partnered with LinkedIn to use Economic Graph insights to help inform economies all over the world. In China, the Economic Graph already has 36 million members, 364,000 companies, 23,000 skills, and 15,000 schools. With the new China Digital Economy Talent Report, LinkedIn is launching the Economic Graph in China in order to help China’s policymakers, employers, and professionals better understand the digital skills needed in China today. The digital talents distribution in China shows a weak north and strong south; most digital talents stay in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen for better career development. Top 15 Cities of Digital Talents According to the report, the distribution of digital talents is highly in accordance with the level of development of digital economy. The 10 cities with the largest pools of digital talent are: Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan and Xi'an. With Beijing, Tianjin, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta being the hub for digital talents, southern cities show clear advantage over northern ones in terms of the number of digital talents. In contrary with the hot topic of “escaping from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,\" digital talents still tend to flow into tier-one cities with Shanghai and Shenzhen being the top two cities in terms of talent influx. The third place was taken by Hangzhou in place of Beijing. Manufacturing, financing and consumer goods are leading the trend of internet, and diversified advantages are seen in different regions. The report shows that about 50 percent of digital talents are in basic industries such as internet, information communication and other ICT industries while others are in traditional industries such as manufacturing, financing and consumer goods. Meanwhile, diversified advantages in digital transformation talents in different regions has also been seen. Superior Industries in Digital Transformation in Top 10 Cities of Digital Talents Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou are the “leading cities” promoting the digital transformation of economy in China and enjoy large advantages in terms of the number and overall structure of digital talents. In Beijing and Hangzhou, talents in basic ICT industries outnumber those in ICT convergence industry, and enjoy obvious talent advantage in big data analysis. Most digital talents in Shanghai and Shenzhen are in manufacturing industry, accounting for 22.7 percent and 17 percent of the total number respectively. Additionally, compared with the national standard, Shenzhen and Guangzhou enjoy special advantage in terms of talents in consumer goods industries. Chengdu, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan and Xi’an are “cities of fast growth” in this round of digital transformation with their digital talents shifting from basic ICT industries to ICT convergence industries. Cities like Suzhou have already gained its advantages with 44.6 percent of digital talents in ICT convergence industries. With the global digital economy speeding up its innovation and deepening integration, China economic transformation entered a new phase where the shift from the demand side to the supply side and the change of economic development focus from consumer goods to manufacturing gradually take place. Compared with the digital transformation that happened in the consumer goods industry which rely heavily on the demographic dividend brought by the large number of netizens, the digital transformation in production will depend more on “talent dividend.” The huge talent gap in big data and artificial intelligence and talents with technological and management expertise are extremely hard to find. Categorized by positions held, over 85 percent of digital talents in China are in positions related to product research and development while less than 5 percent work in deep analysis, advanced manufacturing, digital marketing among other positions. Despite the discussion about artificial intelligence on the internet, there’s still a huge talent gap in big data analysis, advanced manufacturing, digital marketing and other newly emerged positions. The lag in training talents expertise at emerging technologies and innovations is still severe. Rankings of most needed digital positions in “leading cities” (left column) and “cities of fast growth” (right column). In terms of the demand for digital talents, research and operational departments in basic ICT industries rank the first. Talents for mid-level management positions are most wanted while demand for entry-level positions gradually dropped. Because of the rapid development of ICT industries, demands for data analysts and built-in software engineers show an uptrend while in Shanghai, the needs for e-commerce specialist are increasing. In Chengdu where entertainment industry is especially prospered, a rising need for user experience designers is seen. In Suzhou, in accordance with its economic strategy, most digital talents are in manufacturing industry, which continues to show high demand of digital talents. Generally, despite the predominance of needs for programming and data analysis expertise, employers start to value more of candidates’ overall skill set including technological, management and leadership skills. In recent years, an absolute increase of needs for talents with both technological and management skills such as program management and product operation expertise are seen. With the insight from this report, academic institutions can direct its talent training strategies according to the supply and demand relations in different positions. Governments can learn better about talent flow and technological gap so as to generate targeted talent acquisition strategies for better connections between talents and opportunities and eventually more prosperous future. As suggested by Professor Chen Yubo: “Through the in-depth learnings about digital talents, both central and local governments can be more informed of the development of digital economy and digital transformation in the country as a whole and in different regions. The government could be more targeted to acquire and train digital talents and build talent acquisition and training mechanisms based on demand. The industry basis and innovative environments deserve to be valued more when it comes to retaining digital talents. It is advisable for local governments to attract digital talents through accumulating industry advantages rather than simply offering benefits. ” Download report: About Tsinghua SEM Center for Internet Development and Governance Founded in April 2016, the Tsinghua SEM Center for Internet Development and Governance (CIDG) leverages its research in the field of Internet economy and management, advantages in talent raining and international influence to echo the national cyber development strategy.

LinkedIn’s mission is to connect the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful. As the world's largest professional network, LinkedIn have more than 530 million users, covering more than 200 countries around the world, including executives from every Fortune 500 company. In 2016, Fortune ranked LinkedIn as one of the 50 “Change the World” companies. LinkedIn has a diversified business model with revenue coming from the Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Sales Solutions and Premium Subscriptions products. LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce, and create the world's first Economic Graph. In January 2014, choosing \"领英\" as its Chinese name, LinkedIn officially announced its entry into China in order to better connect the Chinese professionals, and to provide a global platform to help them achieve their career aspirations. Through its big data and global platform, LinkedIn hopes to connect global talents and business opportunities with Chinese government and businesses, and thus help support China's economic development. Since LinkedIn's entrance into China, the number of Chinese users has increased by more than 8 times, numbering at over 36 million users. Currently, there are over 2.6 million job opportunities offered through more than 364K companies and 15K schools. And China members collectively have over 23K standardized skills. About LinkedIn’s Economic Graph LinkedIn’s Economic Graph is a digital representation of the global economy based on data generated from 530 million members, 50,000 skills, 18 million companies, 11 million open jobs, and 29,000 educational institutions. In short: it’s all the data on LinkedIn. Through mapping every member, company, job, and school, we’re able to spot trends like talent migration, hiring rates, and in-demand skills by region. These insights help us connect people to economic opportunity in new ways. By partnering with governments and organizations around the world we help them better connect people to opportunities.

This new data shows that 75 percent of 25-33 year olds have experienced a quarter-life crisis, with the average age being 27. Here’s what else we discovered: Finding a job that they're passionate about is the top concern While most people have experienced a quarter-life crisis, what exactly is causing this anxiety? Sixty-one percent say finding a job or career they’re passionate about is the number one cause. Another top reason is comparing themselves to their more successful friends. Nearly half (48 percent) say this has caused them anxiety, with women feeling this even more than men (51 percent vs. 41 percent). People in this age range feel a lot of uncertainty and frustration around their careers, even more so than pressure around their relationships and personal life goals. //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/11/new-linkedin-research-shows-75-percent-of-25-33-year-olds-have-e','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'i5irzYCnOdU'); //]]> Career pivoting is becoming more common Going through this stressful period can lead those in their 20s and 30s to make big career and life shifts that impact their professional world. More than one-third (36 percent) have entirely changed their careers, switching to new industries and different roles. Although career pivoting is prevalent among 25-33 year olds, this may be more of a result of the changing workforce — LinkedIn data shows that job hopping overall has doubled in the last year, and more than two-thirds of job changers have pivoted careers. Nearly one-quarter (23 percent) have taken a career break during this period of uncertainty, taking time off from work to reevaluate what they want to do. One in ten have switched from full-time work to freelance or temporary work assignments. More than half of those experiencing a quarter life crisis are looking for career advice While there isn’t one simple solution to getting over a quarter-life crisis, getting advice from people that have had similar experiences can help when you’re at a crossroad in your career. Our research found that people are looking for advice, but are unsure of where to turn. Although more than one-quarter (28 percent) of 25-33 year olds know what their dream job is, they’re unsure how to approach a career move. On top of that, 56 percent want advice to figure out what’s next, but don’t know where to go for answers. Forty-one percent feel they aren’t getting enough support at work to help them progress. Forty-three percent would like to find a career mentor but don’t have the right connections. To address this and make it easier for people to connect with one another for lightweight mentorship, we launched a new Career Advice feature that can help. If you’re interested in making a career switch, looking for salary negotiation tips, or need help with work life balance, you can use Career Advice to find professionals on LinkedIn who can help based on what type of advice you need and your interests. Career Advice is rolling out now to members in the U.S., U.K., India and Australia, and will be expanding globally in the coming months.

With lead gen forms, marketers reduced their average cost per lead by more than 20 percent. Because this delivered such strong ROI, we decided to expand our lead gen capabilities to more LinkedIn products, including Sponsored InMail and Dynamic Ads. Today we are excited to announce that marketers can use Lead Gen Forms on their Sponsored inMail campaigns.

With our newest Dynamic Ads lead gen format, you can instantly generate leads and enable content downloads —such as the download of an ebook or whitepaper— directly from the ad unit itself. Just like with Lead Gen Forms for Sponsored Content or Sponsored inMail, you can access your leads directly from Campaign Manager, or leverage our partners to pass leads to your marketing automation or CRM system.

We spend a considerable amount of time at work so being comfortable with who you are and expressing what you feel is vital for us to be happy at work. However, our research found that more than half of Australian workers hide some aspects of themselves in their professional life and almost three quarters don’t feel comfortable expressing their vulnerabilities at work. The research findings have been released to coincide with the launch of #BringYourWholeSelf — a new campaign developed by LinkedIn to encourage Australians to be more open about their values, aspirations and opinions in their professional life. When asked why they hold back elements of themselves in the workplace, over half (57 percent) of the professionals surveyed said they wanted to avoid conflict, while more than a third (35 percent) said they were concerned about how others would react or perceive them. It’s quite clear that professionals have a fear of being judged and don’t want to create any tension with their colleague or managers. The reasons get more personal when we delved deeper to understand what’s stifling them. Thirty-five percent of respondents said they hold back expressing their mental health and wellness, with nearly 74 percent saying it is a career limiter. Other key insights: One in five Australians hold back from expressing their sexual orientation in the workplace, with many seeing it as a career limiter.

The need for workers with health care management and nursing skills points to continued momentum in Toronto’s health care industry and can also be partially attributed to Canada’s aging population and growing need for healthcare services. The GTA continues to lose workers to the U.S.: The San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Los Angeles – replacing British Columbia in this quarter’s Workforce Report — are the top three cities Toronto has lost the most workers to in the last 12 months. Toronto is gaining talent from the Middle East and rest of Canada: Toronto attracts the most workers in the last 12 months from Montreal, Mumbai, and the United Arab Emirates. The LinkedIn Workforce Report helps workers better navigate their careers by highlighting workforce trends in the GTA. Insights include whether hiring is up, down, or flat, which skills cities need most, and where workers are moving to and from.

The report, based on our US Workforce report, is tailored to the British economic environment and the particular spotlight that the country's economy is under as the preparations for Brexit continue. The UK was a natural next step for the Workforce Report, with a LinkedIn membership of more than 23 million members providing insights drawn from more than 70 percent of the working age population. The UK Workforce Report shows how much hiring is increasing or decreasing across the UK, its regions, and industries; and where workers are moving to and from. Our first UK report reveals: Hiring rates shrug off Brexit uncertainties. In September and October, the UK hiring rate was very strong, up 15 percent year-on-year (YoY) in September, and up 16 percent YoY in October. This, despite near full employment and the uncertainty of Brexit, shows that companies are hiring more workers — a strong sign of confidence in the future. But Brexit did hit the hiring rate in July 2016 hard. This first Linkedin Workforce Report for the UK provides new insight into hiring activity in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in the summer of 2016. We would normally expect hiring in July to be high, as businesses take on new staff ahead of the August break, new university graduates enter the workforce, and companies make mid-year adjustments. In 2016 that was not the case: hiring fell 4 percent from June to July (seasonally adjusted). This could indicate that companies delayed talent decisions in the immediate aftermath of the referendum. London is not over. There has been much discussion about the future of the city’s place as a financial capital and the attractiveness of the UK to international talent, as well as debate about the cost of living and the quality of life the capital offers. However, our data shows that London is a talent magnet for British residents and international migrants alike. London attracts the largest net flow of both domestic and international migration and London’s hiring rate also continues to rise, up 9 percent YoY. Ten out of the 12 nations and regions that make up the UK are net importers of international talent. Only Northern Ireland and the North East did not draw more international workers than they lost to overseas. Britain's oil sector is showing signs of recovery. The energy and mining sector has seen a marked increase in hiring as the UK’s oil industry begins to recover — evident in a month-on-month (MoM) increase in the hiring rate of 24 percent in October. The hiring rate in October 2017 was 38 percent higher than the year prior. The UK Workforce report is is a tool that can help policy makers, business and individuals make better economic decisions.

With this new feature, professionals will get the inspiration and resources they need to craft a compelling resume directly within Word, along with relevant job opportunities from LinkedIn Jobs. In a recent survey of U.S. professionals, nearly 70 percent (69 percent) stated the most challenging part of writing their resume is not knowing whether they are portraying themselves in the most effective way, and more than 50 percent (51 percent) reported that customizing their resume for a specific role was a roadblock to success. With Resume Assistant, based on selected job title and industry, job-seekers can see relevant work experience examples and top skills from the LinkedIn profiles of professionals in their desired role, to help give them the inspiration they need to create a compelling resume. In addition, we’ll surface relevant job openings from LinkedIn’s more than 11 million open jobs on the platform, and job-seekers will have the option to turn on Open Candidates to quietly signal to recruiters that they’re open to new opportunities.

Skills developed in politics – ranging from grassroots organizing and political campaigns to political communication and economic development – are highly coveted, according to the November LinkedIn Workforce Report.

In state capitals like Nashville and Denver, state government agencies and universities are the top employers for people with a political background. The rising demand from tech companies and NGOs is a trend we’re keeping an eye on. On the national jobs front, hiring across the U.S. was 24.1 percent higher this October than it was in October 2016, lifted by the oil and energy industries, which continued to add more workers, and had the biggest year-over-year increase in hiring (33 percent higher). Manufacturing and industrial (26.3 percent higher) and architecture and engineering (23.3 percent higher) were second and third.

The highest ranked companies include Uber (#1), Airbnb (#2), WeWork (#3), Lyft (#4) and Slack (#5). You can check out the complete U.S. Top Companies | Startups list here. While startup culture reigns supreme at these top companies, complete with nap pods throughout Casper’s (#49) HQ, an on-site spa at Credit Karma (#48) and slippers as office attire at Houzz (#9), these major players are shaking up industries and Silicon Valley as we know it: Beyond the Bay Area: Companies on the list hail from across the U.S., from Boston to Seattle, and Chattanooga to Ann Arbor. While San Francisco takes the top spot as the city with the most representation, a third of the companies on the list were founded outside of startupland, with New York and Chicago coming in second and third. The Female Factor: Some 12 percent of the companies on the list have a woman at the helm, which is double the percentage of female CEOs on the Fortune 500 list. From cars (#6 NIO’s Padmasree Warrior) to cosmetics (#13 Glossier’s Emily Weiss), women are showing up in a bigger way. The Rise of the (non)Unicorn: Proving that success can be achieved at any stage and size, honorees such as Glossier (#13), Convoy (#10) and Flexport (#14), along with a full two-thirds of the list, are each valued at under a billion dollars. Outside Tech: And it’s not only tech startups on the list. More than half of the companies ranked are outside of the traditional tech space in industries including education (General Assembly #11, Udacity #19, etc.), retail (Stitch Fix #32, Moda Operandi #43, etc.), finance (Stripe #12, Affirm #27, etc.) and healthcare (GRAIL #17). Big Runway: In total, the 50 companies have received $40 billion in funding with the average startup raising as much as $72 million. The valuation of companies on the list is over $80 billion total. “LinkedIn has unique insight into where professionals want to work,” says Daniel Roth, editor in chief, LinkedIn. “For this startups edition of our Top Companies list, we looked at which companies were getting the most attention from job seekers, how engaged they were with the startups and how well those companies were attracting talent from the Top Companies. Some of the most intriguing companies right now — and many that have grown from garage to Goliath at an unbelievable speed — are startups, and professionals are taking notice. These are the companies to follow and watch now.” LinkedIn Top Companies | Startups List Methodology The Top Companies | Startups list is a part of the LinkedIn List franchise, an ongoing editorial series that celebrates professionals and companies making an impact in the professional world. Together with CB Insights, LinkedIn evaluated key factors for eligibility including independent and privately held companies no more than 10 years old, with more than 100 employees and at least one round of venture-backed funding. The list includes rankings for the U.S. and the United Kingdom. LinkedIn Lists are fueled by a combination of exclusive LinkedIn data mapping the professional landscape and an editorial lens from LinkedIn’s global editorial team. The lists deliver insightful introductions to the people and companies who are impacting the professional landscape.

But we know that finding the time to reply or simply be responsive to incoming messages can sometimes be a challenge with everything else you have going on. To help you shave a little time and more easily respond to your messages, we’ve made our reply suggestions smarter. Using machine learning, we’ll show you suggestions that are more contextual and relevant to the conversation you’re having. We’ll suggest at most three responses based on the message you’ve received. For example, if an old friend asks if you’re available to catch up over coffee next week, you may see suggestions like “Yes I am,” or “Sure!” or “What time?” Coming soon, we’ll be personalizing your smart replies further so that the suggestions are even more fitting for the conversation you’re having. For example, you may soon see a response like “Thanks, Joe!” versus the more simplified “Thanks.” If you’d like to learn more about the behind the scenes work that goes into generating smart replies, check out our post on the LinkedIn Engineering Blog.

Today, sales reps need to involve more buyers in the purchasing process, rely upon a collection of disparate sales tools to do their job, and better collaborate with their marketing counterparts, adding new layers of complexity to the sales process. We believe companies that focus on working together within and across business functions will have the best chance at success. At today's Executive Sales Forum, we announced several upcoming Sales Navigator features that will empower businesses to work more efficiently across their organization, their sales team and a range of sales productivity applications. Sales and Marketing Integration Sales and marketing are key to closing deals, but many companies find aligning these two functions challenging. That’s why we are announcing a plan to integrate Sales Navigator and LinkedIn Campaign Manager so that marketers can target the accounts and leads their sales team is pursuing. Additionally, sales reps will also be able to see how prospects are interacting with Marketing campaigns from within Sales Navigator. Reps will receive alerts when any of their saved accounts have engaged with their company’s sponsored content on LinkedIn. Sales Navigator Application Platform Salespeople spend a lot of time in apps besides CRM and email, and most reps use at least a half dozen different solutions per week. What if you could get these tools to work together so you spent less time on busy work and more time closing deals? //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/10/linkedin-announces-major-updates-to-sales-navigator','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'1GouDRU72kQ'); //]]> The Sales Navigator Application Platform (SNAP) is a new partner program that provides Sales Navigator integrations across your sales stack.

That’s why we’re excited to announce LinkedIn Data Validation, a set of capabilities that will enhance CRM data quality and provide actionable insights. LinkedIn Data Validation will identify leads and contacts who have left the company they’re mapped to in CRM. Sales professionals can use this intelligence to understand whether they have to bring a new contact into their deals, or if they can leverage existing relationships to pursue new business. Dealbook Sales managers spend more time managing their pipeline than working to close the deal. We acquired Heighten to address this challenge and are announcing our plan to integrate the Dealbook feature of Heighten into Sales Navigator, which will allow sales professionals to be more efficient in managing their pipeline. A New Global Navigation Experience We’ve redesigned our search and navigation bar to make it easier to find the most relevant prospects. Guided Search helps you find people and companies that you want to do business with. Features, such as Saved Searches and Company Search, are front and center, and our new Discover tab will proactively suggest new people and companies that fit your ideal buyer profile. Mobile briefings We’ve completely re-imagined the Sales Navigator app to help reps understand the next best action they should be taking throughout the day, and alert them of activities, such as saved leads who have recently viewed their profile. Mobile Briefings integrates with your mobile calendar and gives you meeting prep documents for your business meetings that day. Mobile Briefings include profiles, icebreakers, and relevant company information, so you can quickly prepare for your meetings and feel confident about building rapport with your attendees. These new features make Sales Navigator more powerful than ever before and enable working together in ways simply not possible before.

Houston, Dallas and Austin are three of the top ten cities with the largest relative shortage of construction skills nationwide. Impacted areas will need to look to the Northeast (Philadelphia, Hartford, Providence) and the Midwest (Cleveland, Kansas City, Milwaukee) where there are large pockets of available construction workers. Meantime, on the national jobs front, hiring across the U.S. was 19.8 percent higher in September versus September 2016. The oil and energy sectors once again experienced the biggest year-over-year increase (27.3 percent higher), with the manufacturing and industrial (20.7 percent higher) and aerospace, automotive, and transportation (19.1 percent higher) industries rounding out the top three. Seasonally-adjusted hiring (hiring that excludes seasonal hiring variations – like companies hiring less in December due to the holiday season) saw a 2.4 percent jump from August to September. Key insights: Help wanted: construction workers needed in the Southeast – In recent weeks, hurricanes have wreaked destruction in Houston, Miami and Puerto Rico. Houston, Dallas and Austin are three of the top ten cities with the largest relative shortage of construction skills nationwide. Our data shows that there are large pockets of underutilized construction workers in the Northeast. Hiring remains strong, creeps steadily upward through September – Hiring across the U.S. was 19.8 percent higher this September versus September 2016. Seasonally-adjusted hiring (hiring that excludes seasonal hiring variations – like companies hiring less in December due to the holiday season) was 2.4 percent higher in September than in August this year. A notable exception was Miami, which experienced a 26.7 percent month-over-month decline in seasonally-adjusted hiring; this decline was likely due to an extended disruption to hiring from the Hurricane Irma evacuation. Growth in Nashville’s tech sector outpaces supply of skilled workers – Nashville has a small but rapidly growing tech sector, which is currently constrained by a scarcity of workers skilled in IT infrastructure, software engineering management, web programming, and artificial intelligence. While the supply for all four of these skills has increased over the past year, there is still a skills shortage for each of them due to rapidly increasing demand. In fact, Nashville has the biggest skills shortage for software engineering management in the United States. Click here to read more of our October LinkedIn Workforce Report. More than 141 million workers in the U.S. have LinkedIn profiles; over 20,000 companies in the U.S. use LinkedIn to recruit; over 3 million jobs are posted on LinkedIn in the U.S. every month; and members can add over 50,000 skills to their profiles to showcase their professional brands. This gives us unique insights into U.S. workforce trends. The LinkedIn Workforce Report helps workers better navigate their careers by highlighting workforce trends in the U.S. and across 20 cities.

LinkedIn Talent Insights is a new self-service tool that gives talent professionals direct access to rich data on talent pools and companies, providing a dynamic view on rapidly changing market conditions that will help inform both immediate and long-term talent decisions. LinkedIn Talent Insights will give you self-service access to two types of reporting: The Talent Pool report and the Company report. Through the Talent Pool report, you’ll be able to precisely define and understand specific populations of talent you’re interested in. Within a few clicks, you’ll have a clear picture of what you need to know to recruit and hire for those hard-to-fill roles. For example, where does this talent live, what schools are producing this talent, and how engaged is this talent with your brand. The Company report will give you insights at a company level so you can see how well you’re doing in attracting and retaining talent, and develop branding and recruiting strategies to get even better. For example, where talent is moving to and from and distribution by function and geography. Talent intelligence is especially important when approaching strategic discussions with business leaders on hiring and workforce planning, for example understanding why attrition is high, or where to source engineers if your local market lacks supply of the talent you need. We’ve also designed every feature of this product to make it easier for talent leaders: Easy-to-understand visualizations of data for exporting and sharing, with business leaders and key stakeholders Self-serve so any time or day you can access data about your talent options Seamless integration with LinkedIn Recruiter, so you can put your insights to work, immediately Also announced at Talent Connect: End to end hiring: We unveiled plans to develop a solution that will help create a more effective and seamless hiring process – from first sourced through onboarding. The end-to-end hiring offering will combine LinkedIn’s rich data set, existing sourcing tools and new candidate management technology to bring sourcing, managing and hiring candidates in one place. This will be released in 2018. Jobs Targeting: Designed to reduce the time spent reviewing unqualified applicants this will allow you to select the exact qualifications in the candidate you’re looking for. You can define specific skillsets, years of experience, and level of education associated with a particular job title for more precise targeting. This also will be released in 2018. LinkedIn Match: This will help you quickly evaluate how well an applicant meets job requirements. As a planned integration with partner Application Tracking Systems (ATS) through Recruiter System Connect, LinkedIn Match will show a checklist indicating how an applicant’s experience matches a job description, helping customers prioritize candidates within the ATS dashboard. LinkedIn Match leverages member profiles and resume data to provide insights on the applicants in the ATS — no matter what method they used to apply. This will be released in 2018. With a focus on talent intelligence, we recognize the importance of infusing data into every step of the hiring process and look forward to sharing more on these products in 2018.

Aside from the periodic recession, many nations were at or near full employment. Rapid productivity growth was underpinning an improvement in living standards. A university degree was a meal ticket to a high-paying, secure job as a professional. And for workers with a high school diploma, jobs on manufacturing assembly lines offered a pathway to middle-class prosperity and upward mobility. While this was not necessarily the reality everywhere, it was the model that set expectations for what a career was supposed to look like. Now we live in a much less certain world. In many countries, recovery from the latest recession has been gradual and protracted, with unemployment and underemployment coming down only slowly. Global productivity growth has decelerated sharply, as has pay growth. Cutbacks of private sector benefits and government safety nets are forcing workers to bear more risk than they did in the past. And while their economic impact has thus far been muted, automation and artificial intelligence raise the specter of mass displacement of workers. So what are workers to do? We often hear that workers will have to plan ahead, engage in continuous retraining to upskill themselves, and expect to radically pivot multiple times throughout their careers. But that’s a lot of pressure to lay on a person. It’s hard to know what types of skills are most important to learn, or how to best position yourself to succeed in the face of changing economic times. Human capital is dynamic — and so are your skills Today the World Economic Forum releases its Global Human Capital Report 2017, which evaluates countries on how well they’ve optimized their workforces by equipping them with knowledge and skills needed to create value — and be successful — in the global economic system. At LinkedIn, our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. That’s why we’ve partnered with the World Economic Forum to contribute to the creation of the Global Human Capital Report 2017. One of unique advantages of LinkedIn data is our ability to analyze the labor market in an unprecedentedly granular way. We can break down human capital into its most fundamental and critical component unit: skills. At LinkedIn, we track the supply and demand of 50,000 distinct skills as provided by our members. This allows us to identify geographically where particular skills are in shortage or in surplus. It allows us to identify which skills are emerging, or growing rapidly, or persistent over time, or shrinking in popularity. We can identify the “skills genome” — the unique skills profile — of a city, a job function, or an industry. These types of insights make it possible to advise on which skills are needed when the economy next changes gears. Stay adaptable by nailing the fundamentals LinkedIn’s research in this year’s Global Human Capital Report explores the skills genomes of different university degrees over time. There are certain skills commonly held by all types of college majors; there are other specialty skills that are more unique to specific fields. So which skills should you learn? We found that, across diverse fields of study, there are certain core cross-functional skills that underpin human capital. These include interpersonal skills, like leadership and customer service, and basic technology skills, like knowing how to use word processing software and manipulate spreadsheets. Having a strong base in these cross-functional skills is important across industries and job titles. Cross-functional skills also give people the capacity to pivot careers when needed. Retraining becomes a lot easier when you need to learn just one or two new things, rather than an entire new field of knowledge. //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/9/investing-in-skills-thatll-go-the-distance-','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'K6--_AVYZ5I'); //]]> While cross-functional skills are versatile and likely to stand the test of time, they aren’t necessarily the ones that will launch you into a lucrative career off the bat. Indeed, our data shows that younger generations tend to study more specialized fields than their predecessors, and today’s travel and tourism or international studies majors have more niche fields than, say, the history major of yore. This broader economic trend toward specialization reflects a widening economy that demands more specific skills from the workforce as it grows. What is clear is that interpersonal skills are unlikely to be rendered obsolete by technological innovation or economic disruptions. In a changing workforce, it's having a strong foundation in versatile, cross-functional skills that allows people to successfully pivot. Learning the latest or hottest technology skills shouldn’t come at the expense of investing in the basic, core skills that people need to be successful in the workforce. Helping governments and other public policy stakeholders to better understand, analyze and approach the development of their human capital in this way is our ultimate hope. We’re excited to be partnering with the World Economic Forum, and to leverage our unique LinkedIn dataset as part of the Global Human Capital Report 2017, to help accomplish this goal. We look forward to our continued work together.

One exception to the positive national trend was in the Houston metro area between Aug 27 and Aug 30 during Hurricane Harvey -- Houston saw a sharp decline in hiring compared to normal levels. The oil and energy sectors once again added the most workers, and had the biggest year-over-year increase in hiring (16.3 percent higher). Manufacturing and industrial (7.4 percent higher); and government, education, and nonprofit (5.9 percent higher) rounded out the strongest industries. Seasonally-adjusted hiring (hiring that excludes seasonal hiring variations – like companies hiring less in December due to the holiday season) was 1.5 percent higher in August than in July this year. Throughout the summer, hiring has stayed consistently strong with no signs of weakening, nor of further acceleration since July. Key insights: Hospitality and travel skills in demand as tourists flock to the fastest-growing U.S. cities – Move over Miami and Las Vegas. If you’re looking to work in the travel industry, head to the fast-growing cities of Austin, Denver, Jacksonville, and Tampa-St. Petersburg. This is where we’re seeing rapid growth in demand for people skilled in travel and hospitality skills. These skills include hotel management, reservations and hotel booking, tour operating, business travel, and destination marketing. Demand for travel and hospitality skills is also growing in the booming cities of Portland, Oklahoma City, and Phoenix. Across all these cities, operations, sales, and customer-facing roles are at the top of the list for open jobs. Detroit is the new Chicago, with surging demand for high tech skills – Detroit has rebounded from the depths of its 2008-2013 unemployment crisis with an unemployment rate that’s now closer to the national average and comparable to its Midwestern peers like Chicago and Cleveland-Akron. This economic upswing is reflected in Detroit’s inbound and outbound migration patterns. Like most Midwestern cities, Detroit loses more people than it gains – but Detroit is losing people on a much smaller scale than what we’re seeing in Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland-Akron. Interestingly, we’re also seeing Detroit pulling talent from Chicago. When adjusted for population size, Chicago is losing three times as many people as Detroit. While Detroit is losing people to the Sunbelt and Pacific Northwest, it’s also seeing inflows from cities like Houston. In contrast, Chicago, Cleveland-Akron and St. Louis are losing people to Houston.

LinkedIn Sponsored Content has always let you reach professional audiences in the newsfeed, but what if you could reach them beyond the platform, on the apps and websites where they spend their time? Today, we are excited to announce the LinkedIn Audience Network, a native advertising network that enables you to reach even more professionals with your ads by placing your Sponsored Content on high-quality, third-party publishers across mobile and desktop. The LinkedIn Audience Network is designed to increase your marketing footprint beyond the LinkedIn platform so you can extend your campaign’s reach, deliver on your budget more easily and get your content in front of the right people, wherever they are. To date, more than 6,000 LinkedIn advertisers have participated in our Audience Network beta program. On average, these advertisers have seen a 3-13% increase in unique impressions served, and up to an 80% increase in unique clicks. This means that advertisers running campaigns in the Audience Network are reaching new people they hadn’t yet engaged on one of LinkedIn’s owned and operated properties.

The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since 2001, and the percentage of prime working age adults who are employed is the highest it’s been since 2008. While the steady improvement of the job market over the past year hasn’t been the same across all industries and job functions, things have gotten better for workers across skill levels, industries and regions. What does this mean for you? Bargaining power for many workers, like you, is increasing and opens the door to raises, and greater economic opportunity Salary is a key factor in most career decisions. When deciding where to work, where to live, or what to study, pay is often top of mind. The problem is, you don’t always have the compensation data you need to make the best decisions. You decide between paths without knowing the payoffs. To give you more visibility into your next career move, we examined data from more than two million LinkedIn members. We looked at how salaries vary by job title, education level and field of study, location, company size, and industry.

There’s no one path to high earning potential, but now you can better assess your choices along the way. Use this guide to gut-check your professional instincts and learn more about your own salary in the LinkedIn Salary tool, and your career will thank you. Highest-Paying Jobs In the U.S. Let’s start at the top with the highest-paying jobs overall. Medicine pays the most, but once you reach the top ranks in business, you’re paid generously too. Leadership roles in finance, sales, tax, human resources, strategy, supply chain, research and development, marketing, and legal are all alternate routes to a high salary. Doctors account for eight of the top 20 highest-paying jobs, with most earning more than $300,000 annually. Orthopaedic surgeons take the top spot at $450,000. Finance pays the largest bonuses. This means greater salary variability but also greater potential upside. If you have a higher tolerance for risk, finance may suit you. Investment banking associate is the only mid-level role in the top 20. For certain job roles four cities stand out as more lucrative places to live: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston.

So let’s consider the highest-paying jobs at the more junior level, ones that only require 1-3 years of experience. If you’re early in your career, you can still make six figures. Both investment banking analysts and associate brand managers have a median income of more than $100,000. The most lucrative entry and mid-level jobs are in finance, but roles in sales, marketing, and engineering also take spots on the list.

Generally the more you learn, the more you earn. There is a positive correlation between years of education and salary. It ranges from high school diploma ($52K) to medical degree ($161K.) The nearly $30,000 salary increase between secondary education and bachelor’s degree (BA) shows the high value of attending a four-year college after high school. The degree positions you to earn a salary that’s just below the national average. Graduate degrees have a wide payoff range, earning 3%-13% more than the average U.S. salary. Doctor of medicine (MD) leads the pack and is more lucrative than business (MBA) and law (JD). Master’s (MA) and research doctorates (PhD) earn more than BA’s, but still less than $100K on average. Advanced degrees have greater salary impact on any given role. For example, a design engineer with a PhD can earn 56% more than the national average. Similarly, having an MBA can bump a program director’s salary to double the national average.

Which fields can earn you the most? If you want to land a high-paying job, computer science is your best bet. Computer science leads all other fields of study with an average salary of $92K while visual art and sociology round out the top three with $90K and $88K, respectively. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) accounts for nearly half of the highest paid fields, with engineering taking the majority of the spots. Considering today’s high demand for tech talent, this comes as no surprise. However, just as many non-technical fields in the arts and social sciences rank high as well. The bottom line is you don’t have to be a tech whiz in school to earn big bucks when you graduate - a wide range of fields lead to high pay. Top 20 Highest Paying Fields of Study in the United States Swipe Field of Study Median Total Compensation (includes bonus and commission if applicable) 1. Computer Science $92,300 2. Visual Art $90,390 3. Sociology $87,900 4. Industrial Engineering & Management Science $85,800 5. Business Management & Administration $83,700 6. Architecture, Design & Applied Art $81,200 7. Law $79,000 8. Electrical & Electronic Engineering $78,600 9. Physics $78,400 10. Journalism, Media & Communication $77,979 11. Religion $75,000 12. Engineering $73,350 13. Liberal Arts $72,500 14.

Environmental Science & Forestry $55,700 Company Size Can Make A Difference Company size as measured by employee headcount is an important deciding factor for many professionals. Let’s see how salaries compare. Larger companies on average pay more. This makes sense as they generally have more resources than smaller companies and thus can pay more for talent. Keep in mind smaller companies that can’t compete on salary alone often compensate with less quantifiable perks such as strong company culture. Roles are compensated differently depending on company size. For example, if you’re an implementation specialist at a mid-size company, you may be better off moving to a smaller shop where you’ll be paid more for the same job. If you’re an art director at a startup, you may decide to pursue the same role at a large company where you’ll likely make more. How Different Industries Are Paid, And How Men & Women Are Represented Certain industries pay more than others and have a disproportionate number of males or females. Let’s look at the gender breakdown within the highest-paying industries. Note: this is not a pay comparison of men and women in equal jobs - it is simply a comparison of gender ratios within industries. Men are greatly overrepresented in the highest-paying industries. Software and hardware tech industries pay the most and have over twice as many males than females. Manufacturing pays third-highest and has an even greater discrepancy - over three times as many males. Healthcare is the only top-five paying industry with a greater proportion of females. Consumer goods, legal, media, retail, real estate, and education have a higher female ratio too, but the imbalances are less compared to those in the male-dominated industries. Construction has the most glaring gender imbalance, with nearly five males for every female. Corporate services has the most equal balance with a 1-to-1 ratio of men to women. If you’re a woman in a male-dominated industry such as construction, for example, now you can compare your salary to the median and get a sense of whether you’re being underpaid. Salary by Industry Swipe Industry Median Total Compensation (includes bonus and commission if applicable) Median Bonus 1. Software & IT Services $104,700 $11,700 2. Hardware & Networking $101,100 $11,500 3. Manufacturing $85,600 $9,600 4. Healthcare $84,600 $10,900 5. Finance $82,800 $13,000 6. Consumer Goods $80,000 $11,000 7. Construction $78,500 $7,300 8.

Real Estate $68,600 $8,500 14. Design $67,800 $3,300 15. Education $59,500 $5,100 Location, Location, Location Where you live is tied to how much you earn. Let’s see how salaries stack up across the nation. The San Francisco Bay Area leads the country with highest average salary, and the only city exceeding $100K. Helping cement the west coast as the higher-paying coast, Seattle takes the second spot with an average salary of $96K. The East Coast cities of Washington D.C., New York and Boston round out the top five. Not surprisingly it’s these coastal cities, with typically higher costs of living, that tend to pay most. Engineering roles are in high demand nationwide as most regions in the top 20 pay above average for those roles. So if you’re an engineer who’s willing to move to Texas, for example, you’ll likely find higher-paying opportunities in Houston, Austin, and Dallas. If you are planning a career change and are willing to move locations, consider these top-paying regions. If want a change from Los Angeles, for example, Denver may be a great alternative because you could earn a similar salary. METHODOLOGY: LinkedIn’s State of Salary Report showcases the state of pay across the United States based on salary data from over two million LinkedIn members as of April 2017. To protect member privacy, we de-identify salary data at the time of submission. Once we collect a sufficient number of submissions to analyze the data while protecting member privacy, we aggregate the data at a job title and location level and securely stored the median reported values. To uncover higher-level trends that were not job title-specific (such as Average Pay by Field of Study), we computed the average median value across all job titles for which we had aggregate salary insights available. Insights generated from fewer than 30 salary submissions were removed from the analysis. C-level titles (such as CEO, CIO, etc.), were also excluded from the analysis. The results of this analysis represent the world as seen through the lens of LinkedIn data. As such, our sample is restricted to LinkedIn members and is affected by how members choose to use the site, which can vary based on professional, social, and regional culture, as well as overall site availability and accessibility.

We’ve seen countless examples of how these conversations can help members to get ahead in their careers and find their way in to new opportunities. This is why we continue to invest in new and better tools for you to easily discover content, and also join the conversation. For example, we’ve made it easier for you to share your experiences with the addition of multiple photos in your posts, and we’ve introduced Trending Storylines so you can stay on top of conversations from other professionals, influencers, professionals and news publishers. Now, we’re adding another way to share your experiences and start conversations: native video on LinkedIn. We began testing video last month and we’ve seen so many personal and inspiring videos, such as Edwin Rhemrev detailing his process for sketching a set design; Madison Allen taking people behind the scenes by showing what her company’s forklift can do; and Chris Chien sharing an inside scoop at Comic Con. Ready to start recording? Here’s how: In the LinkedIn mobile app, look for the share box at the top of the feed (iOS) or the post button (Android) and tap on the video icon. You can record a video in the app, or upload something you recorded earlier. See who’s viewing your videos After you post a video, you can see key audience insights such as the top companies, titles and locations of your viewers, as well as how many views, likes, and comments your videos are receiving. With these insights you can better understand if you’re reaching the people and companies that matter to you. You can find these analytics in the dashboard section of your LinkedIn profile on both mobile and desktop. We will be rolling this out to all members globally over the coming weeks.

Meanwhile, to attract qualified candidates and keep an ongoing clientele of companies who need their roles filled, staffing firms have to nimbly navigate their online presence for two very different audiences. Today, LinkedIn Talent Solutions announced the launch of two new products, Pipeline Builder and Career Pages for Staffing, that will address the needs of these hiring challenges and help bring job seekers and employers closer together. Pipeline Builder Pipeline Builder gives recruiters the opportunity to target and maintain a high volume of prospects for specific roles. Using ads to reach the right talent, a personalized landing page to attract prospects and a simple “I’m Interested” button for a low path to entry, Pipeline Builder allows companies to pay extra special attention to more talent at a time, improving the path to hire and resulting in better hiring results. Career Pages for Staffing Firms Specifically designed for LinkedIn's search and staffing clients, this version of LinkedIn Career Pages for Staffing provides a customised view - one for clients and one for talent - tailored for the two vastly different audiences that staffing firms need to reach. The Find Jobs view for prospective candidates and the Hire Talent view for company leads each include relevant testimonials, specific call-to-actions and a “Contact Us” module for simple outreach. Additional product announcements from LinkedIn Talent Solutions include: Commute Time: LinkedIn research reveals that 75 percent of candidates say commute time is a top consideration. Now when a member views a job on LinkedIn, they can immediately see what their commute time would be if they were to join the company. For recruiters, this promotes transparency and ensures candidates know what to expect, before they apply for the role. Recruiter System Connect: allows you to integrate LinkedIn Recruiter with more than 10 Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to streamline your hiring process. Data from the Recruiter tool will automatically sync for simple profile exports and provide consistent and up-to-date candidate information like applicant history and interview feedback.

Other key insights: Shortage of workers in the region with healthcare, nonprofit and education industry skills: The Greater Toronto Area’s skills gap is mostly driven by a scarcity of workers with service-industry skills like healthcare management; nonprofit and fundraising; education and teaching; nursing; crime prevention and criminal law skills; and construction skills. Network administration skills like Microsoft Windows Systems joined the list of scarce skills in Toronto for the August report, and can be partially attributed to tech sector growth following increased federal investment in the region’s innovation hubs Influx of workers from across Canada and the Middle East: Toronto gained the most workers in the last 12 months from Montreal, United Arab Emirates, London, Ontario. Since the May GTA Workforce report, London replaced Kitchener and Calgary for talent inflow into the region. Worker exodus to the US: The San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and British Columbia — replacing Los Angeles in this quarter’s Workforce Report — top the list of cities Toronto has lost the most workers to in the last 12 months. The LinkedIn Workforce Report helps workers better navigate their careers by highlighting workforce trends in the GTA. Insights include whether hiring is up, down, or flat, which skills cities need most, and where workers are moving to and from.

Meantime, seasonally-adjusted hiring (hiring that excludes seasonal hiring variations – like companies hiring less in December due to the holiday season) was 5.4 percent lower in July than in June. While July’s month-over-month dip in seasonally-adjusted hiring may signal that the summer hiring streak is starting to slow, July hiring should still be read as strong. Other key insights: Growing demand for mental health professionals in big cities: Employers in San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston want workers with mental health and psychotherapy skills, ranging from neuropsychology and grief counseling, to cognitive behavioral therapy and crisis intervention. In the biggest U.S. cities, employers hiring for these skills include hospitals, private practices, and local governments. As mental health issues have become more widely discussed, it’s possible that greater awareness has encouraged more people to seek help, and created more jobs for medical professionals with mental health-related skills. Leaving the Big Apple for the Golden State: New York is Los Angeles’ single biggest source of talent, and Los Angeles is New York’s biggest brain drain destination. Last year, New Yorkers moved to LA in greater droves than to any other city. The number of workers coming from the New York was more than double the number coming from Chicago, the next city on the list.

LinkedIn Talent Solutions revealed today a study on today’s Millennial career behaviors that identifies which industries millennials are leaving and joining, and the contributing factors behind these moves. The study found that over the past 12 months, millennials have been flocking more to roles within healthcare, finance and auto/aerospace. Software development and tech, however, continue to lead the way with an almost 10% gain year over year. Unsurprisingly, with more consumers turning to online stores for their clothing, electronics and even grocery shopping, the top industry losing the most millennials is retail & consumer products at an 11 percent decrease, over the last year. Government/education/non-profit, media & entertainment, oil & energy and telecommunications are also among the industries losing millennial talent. For those looking to further understand how to hire, and keep millennial talent, here are a few more insights: The turnover rate for millennials is over twice as high as other generations in today’s workforce, and millennials tend to switch jobs twice as quickly as non-millennials. According to LinkedIn’s Inside the Mind of Today’s Candidate report, the top three reasons millennials decide to switch jobs is 1) lack of career advancement opportunities, 2) unsatisfactory compensation/rewards, or 3) lack of challenging work. That said, millennials are a much more flexible generation. Millennials are 50 percent more likely to relocate for a new role, and LinkedIn found that Seattle, Denver, San Francisco and Charlotte are the top cities gaining millennial job-switchers.

Today, LinkedIn has released the Inside the Mind of Today’s Candidate report, a survey of more than 14,000 global professionals which shines a light into the attitudes and habits of job seekers and helps inform strategies for HR, talent acquisition and business leaders, looking to grow their talent pipeline. The report showcases how professionals are finding jobs, what drives them to change roles, and what they are looking for at the various stages of the process. Key findings include: With companies like McDonald’s taking to Snapchat to hire, social media is still a key element for sharing opportunities: Nearly half of all professionals (49%) are following companies on social media with the intent to stay aware of their jobs. Professionals today place a premium on culture and mission: 40% of respondents wanted to hear about culture, and 27% wanted to hear about mission in their first contact with a recruiter. The hiring manager's involvement in the hiring process, early is important: 56% of people are more likely to respond to outreach from a hiring manager than a recruiter. Growth in a company is a major part of whether candidates choose to stay or leave: Besides a pay raise (45%), people are most likely to leave a job for better skills and interest fit (37%), more growth opportunities (37%) and more challenging work (36%) One of the keys to retaining employees is to offer learning tools. Opportunities for challenge or to improve their skills (56%) is the biggest reason people want to stay in their current job. Companies should be prepared for turnover: only 37% of people plan to stay at their job more than 3 years; however people who plan to stay 3+ years cited that they plan to stick around because of 1) great work-life balance (36%), 2) alignment with company values (26%), and 3) flexible work/telecommuting opportunities (26%). This intersection of insights and instincts will ultimately lead to better understanding today’s jobseeker and more importantly, how to attract and retain quality talent. Download the report here.

Here at LinkedIn, we observe a lot of different behaviors in terms of how buyers and sellers interact. In recent years, we’ve seen a number of disruptive technologies and novel sales practices become mainstream. Here’s what we see: technology is transforming the sales profession, from the way leads are generated, to the conversations that happen once the “digital handshake” is made. To a large extent, it’s accelerating connections, shortening sales cycles, and bringing a new level of transparency that is unlike anything buyers and sellers have ever experienced. To shed light on the evolving sales landscape, we conducted our second annual State of Sales study to understand the impact social networks, business collaboration software and other technologies are having on the overall sales ecosystem. We commissioned CensusWide, a market research agency, to survey over 2,000 U.S. based B2B sales pros and buyers, to capture a 360-degree view of the technologies and strategies that leading salespeople are using to stand apart from their peers, and how these approaches are landing with buyers. Here’s what we found: Sales Tech Is No Longer A “Nice To Have,” It’s Table Stakes The digital sales stack is now firmly established at the foundation of successful sales organizations. This year’s survey shows that companies are receiving the message loud and clear and accelerating tech use in sales strategies accordingly: 98% of top salespeople report using sales technology on the job 90% of salespeople report that sales technology is either “important” or “very important” to closing deals Inside sales professionals are the most tech savvy, with 46% using CRM tools and 40% using productivity apps //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/7/how-the-new-wave-of-tech-is-making-old-school-sales-obsolete','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'isck4m29A-c'); //]]> Social Media Critical To Modern Way Of Selling Last year, we learned that 70% of sales reps were already using social media to build and nurture relationships — a trend continuing to gain steam in 2017. Across the board, salespeople who actively use professional and social networks like LinkedIn and Facebook are seeing a big impact. 62% of top salespeople — those who exceeded their projected target revenue by more than 25% — strongly attribute closing more deals to incorporating social networks into their sales strategy 94% of salespeople who are familiar with social tech say it provides them with valuable insights for connecting with customers and prospects 70% of salespeople expect to invest more time leveraging social tech strategies in the next twelve months, a striking 45% increase year-over-year On the decision-maker side, leveraging social networks is having an impact, too. This year’s survey found that buyers prefer working with salespeople who use professional and social networks to better understand their needs and provide more tailored and timely offerings. 77% won’t engage with salespeople who don’t have insights or knowledge of their business 62% look for an informative LinkedIn profile when deciding whether to work with a sales professional, and 85% consider it important for them to have existing connections with people at their company 69% of millennial buyers are more likely to speak with a sales professional who has a professional social media presence With Sales Tech -- Millennials Lead the Way Last year’s study revealed that millennials use sales technology at higher rates than other generations across the board. This year is no different, as the under 35 years-of-age crowd continues to lead the way in early-stage adoption, while more seasoned professionals are slowly catching on: 56% of Millennials are using collaboration tools such as Box, Google Docs, Microsoft Office and Dropbox, compared to 40% of Baby Boomers 40% of Millennials use productivity apps like Asana, Smartsheet and Trello as part of their daily role, compared to 17% of Baby Boomers 39% of Millennials use enterprise communication apps like Slack and Salesforce Chatter in their day-to-day role, compared to 15% of Baby Boomers 61% of those that have been in service for between 6-8 years use collaboration tools, compared to 48% of those with less than 2 years’ experience Buyers Discredit Negative Media Portrayals of Salespeople We found that perceptions of salespeople are changing as well. Results show that decision-makers increasingly view salespeople as trusted advisors — a far cry from the overtly opportunist image that once overshadowed the profession. 79% agree that the negative Hollywood portrayals misrepresent the profession The top three terms used to describe how the media portrays salespeople are “sneaky” (38%) “devious” (35%) and “aggressive” (32%) Among decision-makers, the top terms used to describe salespeople are “aggressive” (43%) “trustworthy” (31%) and “high integrity” (24%) While sales tech has changed how the profession functions, relationships have always been — and still remain — at the heart and soul of sales. While tech is no substitute for the human element, our State of Sales report shows that when used strategically and appropriately, it helps overcome hurdles and brings buyers and sellers together for the greater good of both.

Key findings: The UK’s biggest businesses are seeing the largest reductions in the size of their workforces, with very large businesses (10,001+ employees) reducing the number of professionals they employ by 1.9%. The pharmaceutical and healthcare industry is the only sector in the UK to see very large firms bolster hiring, which was up by 1.6% YoY. Every other industry saw numbers of professionals employed fall in very large firms, most notably retail (- 5.6% YoY), and financial services & insurance (- 2.9% YoY). Across all companies there was a decline in support (-4.2%) and administration (-3.9%) roles - a trend that continues from the previous year, and suggests business are reducing non-core functions as they look to adapt to the uncertainties of Brexit. British workers continue to strike out on their own as entrepreneurs, sole traders, and in small companies, as they had in the prior year. Between April 2016 and April 2017, there was an increase in the number of professionals in entrepreneurship (+6.4%) and consulting (+5.8%) roles in the UK. During the same period there was a rise in the number of sole traders (+13.5%) and companies with 1-10 employees (+4.1%). The sectors experiencing the biggest increases in single person companies are architecture and engineering (+17.9% YoY) and professional services (+16.9% YoY). LinkedIn’s research also reveals that the US is still the most attractive destination for UK talent leaving the country, with America attracting 12.1% of all British professionals departing the UK. Italy remains the biggest contributor of talent to the UK for a second year in a row.

The industries that experienced the biggest year-over-year increase in hiring in June were oil and energy (39.6 percent higher), manufacturing and industrial (20.3 percent higher), and aerospace, automotive, and transportation (16.3 percent higher). Oil and energy is up due to the rebound in oil prices, and hiring in the other industries is likely due to to increased optimism over the Trump Administration’s promises to lower taxes and reduce regulations. Additionally, while there's been a lot of talk recently about the record number of retail store closures this year, and about 90,000 workers in the industry losing their jobs, we discovered that there's a high scarcity of workers with retail store operations and management skills in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City, Austin, and Denver. These skills range from cashiering and retail sales, to visual merchandising, inventory management, and planograms, to new store development. Brick and mortar retailers may do better in large cities than small cities because they have residents with higher disposable incomes and more luxury and brand name stores that invest in creating unique customer experiences that keep people coming back. And these cities may need more workers with retail skills because they have higher costs of living, which may have caused service-industry workers (which retail workers are part of) to move to more affordable cities and suburbs. The LinkedIn Workforce Report helps workers better navigate their careers by highlighting workforce trends in the U.S. and across 20 cities. Insights include whether hiring is up, down, or flat, which skills cities need most, and where workers are moving to and from.

By 2020, they’ll grow to represent more than 50 percent of the workforce. Much has been written about this generation’s defining traits: purpose-driven, digitally-savvy, and extremely well-connected. But how connected are they really? To understand professional networking behaviors, we conducted a survey among thousands of LinkedIn members worldwide, including more than 7,000 millennials. Here’s what we discovered about the way millennials network: Key Findings: Millennials are unsure of how to reconnect, or what to say when they do. Seventy-one percent of millennials agree that networking is an effective way to build and nurture relationships. Regardless, they find it more challenging than older generations to stay in touch: 43 percent of millennials find it difficult, compared to 31 percent of those older than 45. What’s holding millennials back? Use your network to find your way in. More than half (55 percent) of millennials reach out to their network when they’re starting to think about their next opportunity. When they do tap their connections, many are rewarded: 56 percent of millennials were introduced to a new job through a casual conversation. Methodology: The LinkedIn online survey was conducted Feb. 6 to March 18, 2017 among 15,905 LinkedIn members across 17 countries.

With these new Notifications settings on mobile and desktop you now have the option to: Mute or unmute: Now you can mute any notification so that you stop receiving updates. For example, if you are tagged in a photo from your team off-site you can mute the notification if you don’t want to get notified as others like or comment on the post. If you change your mind, you can go back to that notification and click unmute. Unfollow: If you don’t want to receive updates from certain connections, you have the option to unfollow them directly from a notification. You’ll no longer see their activity in the Notifications tab or in your Feed. They’ll never know you chose to stop receiving their updates and you’ll remain connected on LinkedIn. If you decide you want to follow them again, visit their profile and click on follow from the menu on the top right. Turn off: If you don’t want to get certain types of notifications, like birthday updates or when your connections publish an article for example, you can turn them off. If you change your mind, you can switch back by scrolling to the top of the notification tab on mobile or on the lefthand side on desktop. Coming soon, you’ll also have the ability to delete notifications that you no longer want to see. If you don’t want to alert others when you update your profile photo or change your job position, just turn off the notifications under your profile settings. Click on the \"Privacy\" tab and then choose whether your network is alerted to profile changes. We want to give you more choice over the content and updates you see from your network, and at the same time make it easier for you to stay informed about the people and information you care about."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2017/6/linkedin-data-finds-animation--computer-networking-are-industrie","date":"2017-06-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Research"],"title":"LinkedIn data finds animation, computer networking are industries where your network matters most","text":"We analyzed LinkedIn data to find the industries where your professional network matters most - and least - and the results may surprise you.

With that in mind, we began a project last year to learn how we can play a role in the on-demand gig economy, one of the fastest growing segments of the labor market. Over several months, we spent time with workers from Lyft, Instacart, and DoorDash to understand why they chose to participate in gig work. We consistently heard from drivers, shoppers, and dashers that they enjoyed the flexibility of their work, and that it helped them earn the cash they needed to pay bills, save for education, and support their families. In fact, many of them worked multiple gigs to further boost their incomes. Yet many people who could benefit from the option of on-demand work are unaware that it even exists. That’s why we’re excited to introduce LinkedIn Gigs, a new product we’re piloting in the Phoenix metro area that helps people easily discover and apply for multiple gigs, and equips them with the tools to prepare for their future careers. //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/6/linkedin-gigs--an-easy-way-to-connect-to-gig-work','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'Fob1O0_Vr_8'); //]]> Now people can apply to as many as four gigs — driving with Lyft, shopping for groceries with Instacart, delivering food with DoorDash, and pet sitting with Rover — in a couple clicks. And after applicants start their first gig at any one these companies, they’ll receive a free six-month subscription to LinkedIn Premium with LinkedIn Learning to help them build their networks and learn the skills needed to achieve their long-term career aspirations—whether that means starting a full-time job, freelancing on ProFinder, or anything in between. “Effective job search can be incredibly tough, but LinkedIn Gigs helps connect job seekers quickly and easily to gig work that helps create stability where there may be little. The job seekers I work with daily are looking for ways to help bridge life until their next opportunity,” said Kaliko Martin, Employment Training Specialist with Maricopa County, AZ. “LinkedIn Gigs provides both immediate work and a path to gain skills through LinkedIn Premium.” Ultimately, our goal is to help give unemployed and underemployed people a flexible way to make money quickly along with the training and education tools they need to achieve their long-term career aspirations. We think that quick on-ramps to the gig economy and access to affordable training and education are key components in the broader ongoing dialogue about best supporting gig workers with greater benefits and other support mechanisms. We’re excited to see how LinkedIn Gigs helps people in the Phoenix metro area.

Here’s what we found: Key Findings: Networking attitudes don’t match networking behaviors 38 percent globally said they find it hard to stay in touch with their network. The leading cause? Nearly half (49 percent) globally say it’s because they don’t have enough time. Interestingly, despite the majority (79 percent) globally agreeing that professional networking is valuable for career progression, less than half (48 percent) globally say they keep in touch with their network when things are going well in their career.

The No. 1 thing professionals tell us everyday is that they want to get ahead in their careers but don’t know how. We're here to help, and the answer lies in your network. Nearly all (95 percent) professionals landed their job at Top Companies, the most sought-after companies by job seekers, because of their professional network. Whether you're looking for a job today or thinking about your long-term career path, now is the time to build your professional network. Starting today, we're launching a new series to help you find your way in to your next opportunity. We’ll be sharing tips and advice like: Fake it 'til you make it: Your audience is always watching. Kumail Nanjiani, the actor playing Dinesh on HBO’s Silicon Valley, found his way in by faking confidence early in his career. Nanjiani overcame his insecurities of performing alongside more notable comedians by telling himself to “fake it 'til you make it,” and by convincing himself he was just as talented as his co-performers despite having the same notoriety. Whether you are performing on stage or conducting an informational interview with a second-degree connection, pump yourself up before the conversation and remind yourself that you are qualified. If you don’t think you deserve the job, the other person won’t either! Claim your space: Both on and offline. Vanessa Van Edwards, behavioral expert, advises interviewees be careful not to “turtle,” which means to retract your body to ensure you take up less space. Turtling can can make you look like you have something to hide. Van Edwards suggests that, if possible, to choose the highest seat in the room to sit in, skipping the couch. It helps ensure you claim your space and have a presence in the room. And don’t turtle online either. Whether you are commenting on a former colleagues’ article or sharing the latest industry trend, you always want to ensure you stay top of mind with your LinkedIn network. Don’t bury the lead. When you reach out to a connection in your professional network, Adam Neumann, co-founder and CEO of WeWork, recommends not overlooking the importance of the subject line. A few catchy words that hint towards the conversation can spark a great relationship and get the person on the other end immediately engaged. For the rest of the year, tune in to this blog, our LinkedIn Company Page, YouTube and Facebook for tips and advice on leveraging your network to find opportunity on LinkedIn. Finding the right job starts with the people you already know, check out LinkedIn Jobs and connect to your next opportunity. You can also check out Kumail Nanjiani, Jessica Alba, Troy Carter and others as they share the “game changing” moment in their career in a new series we are launching today."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2017/june-linkedin-workforce-report--may-was-strongest-month-for-jobs","date":"2017-06-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Economic Graph"],"title":"June LinkedIn Workforce Report: May was strongest month for jobs since June 2015","text":"U.S. employers continued to add more workers to their payroll in May, making it the strongest month for hiring since June 2015, according to the LinkedIn Workforce Report. Hiring across the U.S. was 2.4 percent higher than a year ago, with seasonally-adjusted hiring 6.2 percent higher than in April. The architecture, automotive, manufacturing and finance industries saw the biggest gains in month-over-month hiring. Other key insights: Fewer workers moving to the San Francisco Bay Area – The Bay Area is a talent magnet and while it still gains more workers than it loses, the net number of workers moving to the region has decreased 17 percent since February. In comparison, Seattle has seen net migration increase by 2 percent over the same period. What’s to blame? Cities like Portland, Denver, Austin and Charlotte are booming and cost of living is lower. Health care skills are needed in every major U.S. city except for Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis – Health care skills such as clinical data analysis, pharmaceutics and urgent care, are in scarcity in most major cities in the U.S, however, Philadelphia, Cleveland and St. Louis have an abundance of workers with these sought-after skills. That’s likely because they’re home to major medical schools and hospitals. //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/june-linkedin-workforce-report--may-was-strongest-month-for-jobs','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'NhvEcseh3Fc'); //]]> The LinkedIn Workforce Report helps workers better navigate their careers by highlighting workforce trends in the U.S. and across 20 cities.

In the U.S., 50 companies are spotlighted. While every company on the U.S. list fosters a unique culture, business model and executive suite, the list revealed a few stand-out insights: Companies get political. Until recently it was deemed taboo to mix business with politics, but in the current climate companies are tossing those rules aside. Several Top Companies such as Facebook (#3), Airbnb (#11) and Lyft (#38) took firm stances against the immigration ban in early 2017, while many Top Company CEOs including Tesla’s (#6) Elon Musk, JPMorgan Chase’s (#20) Jamie Dimon, The Walt Disney Company’s (#9) Bob Iger and BlackRock’s (#22) Larry Fink sit on the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. The Uber factor. Despite several scandals, Uber still catapulted near the top of the list to #5, uncovering that employees care about tackling big challenges and earning significant compensation ahead of a likely IPO even as negative headlines pile up. In February, the month that an ex-employee wrote an explosive blog post outlining discrimination, the number of people globally viewing open roles and applying to jobs at Uber doubled compared to the same time last year, according to LinkedIn data. With that said, we’ve seen some indication the most recent events are affecting Uber and discuss it here. Size matters. America wants to work for a behemoth. On average, companies on the U.S. list have 66,279 global employees, roughly 20 percent more than the list’s global average. Amazon (#2) leads the U.S. list in number of employees, with 341,000 workers. Here's what the highest ranked LinkedIn Top Companies in the U.S. are doing to attract and keep top talent: Alphabet is on track to hit its goal set in 2012 of using 100 percent renewable energy for its operations. Amazon offers “leave share,” which allows employees to give six weeks of paid leave to a spouse or partner who isn’t eligible for parental leave at their employer. Facebook is working on tackling the internet’s biggest problems such as how to fight fake news and online extremism, and they are also developing new features for the company’s other platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR. Salesforce allows employees to safely and openly share opinions and resolve conflicts with an “Airing of Grievances” feedback forum. Uber gifts employees monthly ride credits and provides many employees with attractive equity plans. Tesla gives all employees access to drive a Tesla Roadster and the occasional opportunity to take one home for the weekend. Apple holds employee events with surprise musical guests and supplies free apples 24/7. Time Warner offers film and television screenings in its offices featuring the latest content from its brands. The Walt Disney Company provides employees with free passes to all Disney theme parks for themselves and their families. Comcast offers all full-time employees free digital television and internet. This year, the list includes rankings for the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Brazil and India. Driven by the LinkedIn Editorial Team, which operates independently within LinkedIn, the list excludes LinkedIn and Microsoft from consideration as is standard for all editorial efforts. Like all content in the LinkedIn List series, the Top Companies list was developed by analyzing billions of actions taken by LinkedIn’s 500-plus million members to come up with a blended score derived from a combination of LinkedIn data and editorial that is used to rank the winners in each geography. LinkedIn Top Companies List Methodology The Top Companies list is a part of the LinkedIn List franchise, which celebrates companies and individuals making an impact in the professional world, and it spotlights the companies that attract and retain top talent globally. The list is fueled by a combination of exclusive LinkedIn data including reach, engagement, job interest, retention and an editorial lens. It’s based on the actions of job seekers and professionals with editorial oversight, highlighting the companies most sought-after today. (You can read more about our full methodology here.)

The rate of hires picked up in April after a slow start in early March, with hiring across the U.S. 16.7 percent higher in April than the same time last year. Seasonally-adjusted hiring (employment that excludes seasonal hiring variations, like companies hiring less in December because of the holiday season) was 3.4 percent higher in April than March. Key Insights: Seasonally-adjusted hiring was down in 10 of the 13 industries the LinkedIn Workforce Report tracks. Only three industries bucked the trend —manufacturing/industrial (up 0.5 percent), aerospace/automotive/transport (up 1.3 percent), and software (up 8.5 percent). Demand for manufacturing skills is strong along coastal cities, but not in the Midwest, which was considered a hotbed for American factory jobs. Cities that are gaining the most workers primarily attract talent nationally and internationally, while cities with shrinking workforce attract workers from nearby towns. //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/may-linkedin-workforce-report--u-s--hires-most-people-since-june','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'Wr6XC1ycXVo'); //]]> The LinkedIn Workforce Report helps workers better navigate their careers by highlighting workforce trends in the U.S. and across 20 cities.

Our Sustainability Team is working toward achieving 100 percent renewable energy, building efficient workplaces and data centers, and operating sustainably for the benefit of our employees, members and the communities we serve. We still have work to do to, but we're making progress with the following: Opening our first Net Zero Energy-designed building in Sunnyvale, which generates renewable energy onsite to power 100 percent of energy use through rooftop solar and higher efficiency lighting and ventilation systems. Our Silicon Valley and San Francisco offices are upgrading now to 100 percent renewable energy to power workplace operations through Community Choice Energy contract options, bringing our global renewable energy use to more than 50 percent. Building a clean energy data center in Oregon in 2016. We received Uptime Institute's highest score-to-date for Efficient IT, and was cited for innovative design to reduce carbon emissions and costs. The datacenter is powered almost entirely by clean renewable energy. Encouraging employee commute programs — less than 55 percent of employees drive alone to work with the support of our transportation programs. We recently launched GoGreen, an employment engagement program that promotes awareness around environmental issues such as cleaner commutes, less waste, and energy efficiency.

As we've worked with job seekers in Colorado and Arizona, we've heard how hard it is to take time away from work (and income) to get the training needed to advance to a more sustainable career path. One great option for workers looking to learn a new skill while earning an income is an apprenticeship. With the majority of U.S. jobs requiring training above a high school degree but less than a bachelor’s degree, there are great career paths accessible to students with post-secondary vocational credentials. Apprenticeships are one of the most compelling models to attain these credentials. We’re starting this exploration in Colorado where we have a close partnership with the state government and Skillful to support middle-skill career pathways. Colorado’s approach to labor market issues is data-driven, and one of the insights that the state’s business and government leaders have surfaced is that only 23 percent of the state’s students graduate with an associate's or bachelor’s degree within three and six years, respectively, of finishing high school. However, most of the high school counseling and other secondary education resources in the state are allocated to help high school graduates pursue a four year degree. Colorado’s leaders know that all students deserve to know what their career, education, and training options are, and how to design their own unique paths to success. These options include college but also apprenticeships, military service, technical training, and work. Colorado has committed to erasing the attainment and skills gaps by making all of these paths real options for all students. To start, Colorado assembled a group of workforce, education and business leaders and visited Switzerland to study their success in vocational training. There, the Colorado delegation learned that 30 percent of high school graduates in Switzerland enter college and the other 70 percent enter apprenticeship programs — a ratio very similar to Colorado’s, which has a population roughly two thirds the size of Switzerland’s. “That’s when it clicked for me,” said Stephanie Veck, the Director of Colorado’s Workforce Development Council (CWDC). “That’s when we saw how the Swiss are successfully serving 98 to 100 percent of young people, with a comparable amount going directly to college, and real opportunities for the other 70 percent. It isn't about these kids or those kids, it’s about ensuring that all kids have an equal opportunity for success and the tools to design a path that is uniquely right for them.” Since returning from Switzerland and by building state-wide consensus on the importance of apprenticeships, Colorado has gone on to establish a business-led commission for work-based learning as well as a private nonprofit, CareerWise Colorado. CareerWise is a new apprenticeships program that works in partnership with public high schools in Colorado so students can learn both in the classroom and on the job during their junior and senior years. We’re excited to partner on a key component of the Colorado apprenticeships program: awareness and transparency. Our first step in this journey is to serve as the Apprenticeship Marketplace for CareerWise Colorado. Specifically, we’re hosting CareerWise apprenticeships as job postings on LinkedIn to create a clear application path. We hope to do the same for all apprenticeships throughout the state. In addition to publishing these opportunities and making them available online — meeting young adults where they are — Colorado took four key steps which can serve as great guidelines for other states interested in promoting apprenticeships: Aligning state leadership around common goals. Governor Hickenlooper established an Education and Workforce Cabinet Subcommittee with representatives from the departments of K-12 Education, Higher Education, Economic Development, Labor and Employment, the Colorado Workforce Development Council (CWDC) and others. Together, they all set shared goals to achieve together. They set a mission to grow the middle class and had great clarity on their pieces of the strategy to reach that goal, recognizing that it was only achievable through cross-departmental collaboration. That collaboration is convened and coordinated through the CWDC. Establishing a common understanding and vernacular. Also known as dispelling the myths! Apprenticeships are not always an alternative to college. While some apprentices will stay in their field of training for the rest of their careers, some will decide they want to go onto college (and some will even have their employers pay for college.) In fact, Denver Public Schools has shown that students in Career and Technical Education programs have 30 percent higher education and career outcomes. It's critical that students, parents and employers understand the variety of career pathways started in apprenticeships and the permeability of school and apprenticeships. Ensuring business leads. Governor Hickenlooper established the BEL Commission (Business Experiential-Learning Commission) in 2015 to “develop, evaluate and implement a systemic solution for integrated work-based education and training to meet the needs of Colorado’s economy.” Two-thirds of the commission seats are held by businesses leaders, and the commission is co-led by Noel Ginsberg, CEO of Intertech Plastics. Colorado was clear on their intention of having government facilitate the creation of work-based learning commissions and organizations, and to serve as a strong partner, but absolutely not to run those groups. The BEL commission serves an important role in ensuring critical mass of business commitment to apprenticeships, all committed to training workers. Sharing the model. By establishing a culture of sharing and an open-source model, BEL and CareerWise maintain high accountability and receive greater feedback. Colorado’s transparency makes it clear that they want to lead in this area. As a result, partners in Colorado received more than $15 million last year from national funders interested in learning from the work in Colorado and in sharing its successes and failures with the rest of the country. Apprenticeships are a promising model for helping workers gain skills to build the foundations of their careers and set themselves up for success. In keeping with our mission to connect the world's workers to make them more productive and successful, LinkedIn is committed to supporting Colorado’s efforts to expand their state apprenticeships program.

Over the past year, we have completely rebuilt the LinkedIn Feed experience. We redesigned it from scratch so you can fully curate your professional experience to keep you informed on top conversations from people you are following and your connections. As a result, and as stated at our press event, we’ve seen a 40%+ increase in year-over-year engaged feed sessions weekly. On top of that, referral traffic to some of our top publishers on LinkedIn has doubled or tripled in that same time range. Trending Storylines enables us to continue building on this growth, with the additional ability to: See what stories are developing: Each story is based on what’s trending, and personalized to you based on what we know about you, such as the industry you’re in. Go deep to learn more: You can discover, learn and explore more about the story being discussed within each storyline. Get diverse perspectives on every story: Each story includes multiple perspectives, ranging from news publishers and influencers, to people in your network, so that you can easily weigh up diverse opinions. For example, if you work in healthcare, you may see a perspective shared by a renowned healthcare expert, an article published by a top medical magazine, and a post shared by someone you follow or are connected to. Use hashtags to easily join the conversation: Each story will have a unique hashtag associated with it, making it easy for you to join the conversation and add your own take on the issue. As the conversations evolve, we will continue to ensure you’re seeing the latest perspectives. Trending Storylines is curated for you by LinkedIn, using a combination of algorithms and our editorial team. In the future you can also start following people and topics that you discover within storylines and as you do so, your LinkedIn Feed will increasingly reflect your professional interests. For example, if you work in machine learning, you will be able to follow this topic and discover new ideas and timely developments in this field. You can find Trending Storylines on your mobile homescreen under the Trending tab. On desktop it’s on the top right hand side of the homepage. Trending Storylines will start to roll out in the U.S. in English starting today, and will include news developing globally. This will expand to other countries soon.

Seattle tech workers keep an average of 59 percent of their income after paying taxes and housing, while Bay Area tech workers pocket only 37 percent. Healthcare workers have the best shot at a job and an affordable home in Phoenix, Indianapolis, and Boston, according to the analysis. Among large markets, Charlotte, Chicago and Dallas offer the greatest chance of a good job and affordable housing for finance workers. There's a good reason thousands of technology workers are flocking to Seattle: the math works out. Tech workers who rent in Seattle can expect to have around $5,500 left over each month after covering taxes and rental housing costs. In San Francisco, they're left with about $4,000. Zillow and LinkedIn combined housing and employment data to analyze a common set of priorities: an affordable rental home and a good job. The two companies used job listings data, salary data, and the percent of workers hired in the past yeari in three industries: health care, technology, and finance. By analyzing income tax rates and Zillow's median rent dataii, they were able to find housing markets across the country where those workers can pocket the largest share of their income after paying rent. For technology workers who rent, Seattle, Austin and Pittsburgh, Penn. came out on top among the housing markets analyzed, with the Bay Area at #4. Finance workers will find job and rental housing harmony most easily in Charlotte, NC, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Phoenix. Healthcare workers' best bets are Phoenix, Indianapolis, Ind., and Boston. Over the past decade, housing prices in coastal markets have shot up, in large part due to demand from workers following high-paying jobs. West Coast housing affordability is the worst in the nation; renters and home owners there often spend nearly half the median income to rent a typical home, while a rental in the middle of the country costs more like 25 percent of the median income. Perhaps one of the biggest surprises of the findings is that tech workers do OK in the Bay Area, despite its notoriously high housing prices. The median home value in the San Francisco area is $789,300. Taking a tech job in the Denver area, where the median home value is $348,700, actually costs the average Denver tech worker about $140 a month, considering lower salaries there. Salaries for other industries don't hold up as well in the San Francisco area, though. Even highly-paid finance workers keep only about 32 percent of their incomes after paying for housing and taxes. In Charlotte or Chicago, they can pocket a median of 61 percent. \"High demand and inventory shortages have driven up housing prices in some markets so much that even if you land a great job, the salary might not cover living within commuting distance,\" said Zillow Chief Economist Dr. Svenja Gudell. \"On the other hand, the nation's most affordable housing markets don't always offer plentiful employment opportunities. Housing is the biggest line item in most people's budgets, so we did the math for you and found 'sweet spots' -- places with great job markets and housing markets that will leave you with some cash at the end of the month.\" \"As we've seen in LinkedIn's Workforce Reports, hiring has been strong in the U.S. We also know that having insight into where your earnings go further is important to job seekers,\" said Paul Ko, the head of analytics for LinkedIn's Economic Graph. \"That's why these Sweet Spots are so attractive, as these cities are experiencing higher-than-average hiring rates, combined with good salaries and more disposable income.\" For more information about methodology, check out Zillow Research."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2017/linkedin-named-one-of-worlds-most-ethical-companies","date":"2017-03-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Culture","Featured News"],"title":"LinkedIn named one of world's most ethical companies","text":"We're proud to announce that for the second year in a row, LinkedIn is on Ethisphere Institute's “World’s Most Ethical Company” list. We see this honor as a celebration of our commitment to our company’s strong culture and values — something we consider to be a real competitive advantage. At LinkedIn, talent is our number one operating priority. We believe that we attract the best and brightest employees because we dream big. After all, our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. We know we can’t achieve this vision without taking the long view. In Silicon Valley, this long view sometimes gets obscured by the disruption and pace of our industry. While we value disruption because it breaks the mold on the status-quo and brings new and exciting ideas to life, being disruptive also puts us in uncharted territory where the legal and ethical boundaries can be unclear. That’s where our strong culture of integrity comes into play. Championing our culture and values is part and parcel of our professional development and transformation here at LinkedIn. And more and more, our culture has become a key factor in employee retention. We found that the best qualitative measure of our cultural impact is manifested through our employees’ voices, which reveal how our culture and values play into our everyday decision-making and thinking. Participating in Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies vetting process allows us to get an impartial perspective on our culture, business practices, and reputation, and compare ourselves to the best companies in the world. It drives us to continually improve, but perhaps just as importantly, it gives us another opportunity to elevate the conversation internally about sustaining and strengthening our culture."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2017/linkedin-partners-with-national-league-of-cities-to-give-workers-access-to-higher-education-and-job-opportunities","date":"2017-03-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Economic Graph"],"title":"LinkedIn partners with the National League of Cities to give workers access to higher education and job opportunities","text":"At LinkedIn, our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.

That’s why we’re excited to share that LinkedIn and the National League of Cities are working together and in so doing, have partnered with the Kresge Foundation to help strengthen six cities’ economies by ensuring residents have access to higher education and employment. The six cities participating in the pilot cohort are Austin, Texas; Charleston, South Carolina; Corpus Christi, Texas; Houston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; and Nashville, Tennessee. We’ve given more than 50 cities across the globe (including New York, Toronto, Manchester, Stockholm, Amsterdam, and Seattle/Vancouver) our economic insights — like whether hiring is in the city is up or down; which skills workers have and employers need most, and the gap between the two; and how many people are moving in and out of cities, and what their skills are. We’ll offer the six cities involved in this pilot the same types of insights, which they can use to re-shape education and training to help workers develop the skills required to get the jobs of today, and tomorrow. The outcomes of our work in these six cities will be shared nationally to help other cities explore sustainable solutions for their own local communities and economies.

The report is written specifically for workers so they can make more informed career decisions. The data – based on information members add to their LinkedIn profiles, and the hiring done on LinkedIn – provide valuable insights on: Hiring rates nationally, and by industry and city. Hiring across the U.S. was 11.4 percent higher in January 2017 than January 2016. Seasonally-adjusted hiring (hiring that excludes seasonal hiring variations - like companies hiring less in December due to the holiday season) was 11.8 percent higher in January than December. Hiring was higher in almost all industries in January 2017 than January 2016 as well, with oil and energy experiencing the highest spike in hiring year-over-year – up 23.3 percent. Skills gaps, or mismatches between the skills employers need (demand) and the skills workers have (supply). According to the February report, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.’s skills gaps are largely due to a scarcity of workers with service-industry skills - like nursing, education and teaching, and retail store operations. Houston’s skills gap, on the other hand, is due to an abundance of workers with oil and energy skills - like drill and well management, subsea engineering and offshore operations, and geology. Where workers are moving to and from. According to the February report, Seattle, Portland, Austin, Denver, and Charlotte gained the most workers in the last 12 months.

Consistent with our mobile app, we reduced the clutter, made it more intuitive, and more focused to help you connect to the people and information that matter most to you. Most importantly, we want to help you more easily surface ideas, drive conversation, and discover news and topics you care about. Here are just some of the changes, and some tips on how you can make the most of them: 1. Simplified Navigation You’ll see that the navigation on desktop has been dramatically simplified to be consistent with mobile and bring focus to the core areas where LinkedIn can help you the most. The navigation now consists of seven core areas — Home (Your Feed), Messaging, Jobs, Notifications, Me (your profile and settings), My Network, and Search. By clicking the “More” icon, you can now easily find and launch into other experiences that matter to you, such as LinkedIn Groups, Lookup and LinkedIn Learning. //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/make-the-most-of-the-linkedin-desktop-redesign','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'vKHEyOelhkE'); //]]> 2. A new Me tab where you can control and see everything about you Your profile now shows up as Me tab (on the far right at the top navigation). It's where you can access Privacy and Settings, and see who’s viewed your profile, who's commenting on or sharing your posts and your activity. It also offers an intuitive way of updating your profile, so you can easily keep things fresh. Here are a few updates: Highlights: When looking at someone’s profiles, discover what you have in common in the new “Highlights” section. You may see mutual connections you have, companies you’ve both worked at, groups you’re both in or companies where they can help with an introduction. Suggested skills: We now show you suggested skills to add to your profile based on what’s most in demand by recruiters. People with at least five skills listed on their LinkedIn profile receive up to 17x more profile views. Views of your shares: Get details on who's viewed your content by clicking on “Views of Your Share.” To see who’s engaging with a particular post, click on \"views of your share\" at the bottom of that post. Here you'll find a detailed breakdown of companies, job titles and locations of those who are engaging with your content. Coming soon, we’ll add a profile meter with guided tips on what you need to update to look your best and get connected to opportunity. #3 Streamlined My Network tab to manage your connections The connections you build on LinkedIn are important to growing your professional network, so we’ve made it easier to manage by streamlining the My Network tab. You can now see your connection invites, discover other professionals you may know, and manage all invitations in one place. This is the first in a series of articles offering tips to help you make the most of our desktop redesign. In the next few weeks, we’ll also share tips on editing your profile, using your notifications to keep connected and controlling your settings. We hope you’re enjoying the new desktop redesign."},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2017/introducing-the-new-linkedin-desktop","date":"2017-01-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Featured News","Product News"],"title":"Introducing the New LinkedIn Desktop","text":"Today, we're excited to share our new look! This complete overhaul of our technology architecture is the largest desktop redesign since LinkedIn’s inception, and we’ve taken a thoughtful approach to ensure we’re delivering a simplified LinkedIn experience that's more intuitive, faster and creates more value for our members. With this change, we’re also providing a seamless experience across mobile and desktop, leveraging all the great feedback we’ve received from our recent mobile app launch to make it even easier for professionals to quickly access the most relevant professional conversations, content and opportunities. What can you expect? More intuitive: we’ve dramatically simplified the design and navigation, so that there's one consistent experience across mobile and desktop. The new design is also built on a single-page application, which enables a snappy, cohesive, application-like experience. Unlike a traditional web application, you can expect smooth and seamless transitions as you engage with the site, since it doesn’t require full page reloads. Faster innovation: our new technology stack shares the same front-end API’s as the LinkedIn mobile app and allows the release of new code three times a day. This means we can innovate much faster across platforms. More valuable: we’ve made it much easier to discover relevant professional news and insights, quickly join professional conversations about your industry, and access new job opportunities. //<![CDATA[ (function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c<d;c++)a[c]=b[c];return a}return[]};var m=function(b){var d=window;if(d.addEventListener)d.addEventListener(\"load\",b,!1);else if(d.attachEvent)d.attachEvent(\"onload\",b);else{var a=d.onload;d.onload=function(){b.call(this);a&&a.call(this)}}};var n,p=function(b,d,a,c,e){this.f=b;this.h=d;this.i=a;this.c=e;this.e={height:window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight||document.body.clientHeight,width:window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth||document.body.clientWidth};this.g=c;this.b={};this.a=[];this.d={}},q=function(b,d){var a,c,e=d.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");if(a=e&&!(e in b.d))if(0>=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(\"pageYOffset\"in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(\"pageXOffset\"in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+\",\"+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c<b.a.length;++c){var e=\",\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[c]);131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=\"&rd=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\")}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(\"POST\",c+(-1==c.indexOf(\"?\")?\"?\":\"&\")+\"url=\"+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(\"IMG\");if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(\"naturalWidth\"in a&&\"naturalHeight\"in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(\"pagespeed_url_hash\");e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0<a.naturalHeight||e in b&&a.width>=b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=\"\";h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData\",function(){return t});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run\",function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run('/mod_pagespeed_beacon','https://news.linkedin.com/2017/introducing-the-new-linkedin-desktop','kjpVSHBwBQ',true,false,'ajGIG48hMOg'); //]]> What's new?: Streamlined navigation: There are now seven core areas on the navigation bar — Home (Your Feed), Messaging, Jobs, Notifications, Me, My Network, and Search. With one simple click on the “more” icon on the navigation bar you can also launch into other experiences that matter to you, like LinkedIn Learning. Smarter messaging that helps you connect and unlock new opportunities: With our new real-time messaging interface, you can message a connection wherever you are on LinkedIn. We'll also start serving up insights across the site to help you break the ice in any conversation and connect you to your next opportunity. For example, if you see a new job posting you're interested in, we'll suggest someone within your network who works at the company. Richer Feed to keep you informed: With a combination of algorithms and human editors working together, we’ve fine tuned your Feed to surface the most relevant content from people and publishers you care most about. We’ll also be adding new ways for you to dive deep into specific topics relevant to you and follow trending stories. More intuitive search: You now have one universal search box to easily find people, jobs, companies, groups and schools. You can refine your search by using filter options on the right hand side, with the ability to search posts coming soon. Also, we're investing further to better understand signals on what they searching for? Or who you are searching for so we can bring you the best results for any search query. Greater insight into who’s viewing your content: You can now see who’s reading and engaging with the content you share, including the company, job title and location of the people who are interested in your updates. Better suggestions to make your profile stand out: We’ve improved profile suggestions so you can more easily see what you need to do to look your best professionally, for example, suggested skills you should add to your profile based on what recruiters are searching for. The new LinkedIn desktop experience will be rolling out globally to all members over the coming weeks.

With conversation starters it’s much easier to reconnect and stay engaged, with prompts that show: Updates on connections’ professional activity such as when they have started a new job, celebrated a work anniversary or published an article on LinkedIn.

To bridge the gap between parents and their children, LinkedIn is championing its annual Bring in Your Parents Day initiative, where hundreds of companies globally open their doors to their employees’ parents, on Friday, Nov. 4. LinkedIn released today a new global study that examines the relationship between professionals and their parents and found several trends indicating a generational gap at work, including a lack of understanding about their children’s jobs and a lack of communication about how proud they really are: Parents Don’t Tell Their Children They Are Proud, Yet Boast About Their Children’s Work to Others Despite this apparent lack of understanding, an overwhelming 78 percent admit they brag about their child’s achievements to others. However, they aren’t quite as forthcoming to their own children — almost half (45 percent) of parents can’t remember the last time they told their child they were proud of them. Just over a quarter (27 percent) of parents blame a lack of opportunity for not expressing their pride, while one in 10 parents (10 percent) attribute it to a lack of understanding of their child’s job and day-to-day life. Buzzwords, Skills and Basic Knowledge Leave Parents Confused Almost half (46 percent) of parents are baffled by the buzzwords and lingo their child uses when talking about their job, while 28 percent think they would lack the relevant skills and knowledge to do the role. Fifteen percent confess to not knowing their child’s job title or even what company they work for. Parents Think Their Children Will Surpass Their Own Professional Success Parents also believe their children have more opportunities in the workplace than they did — 56 percent of mothers believe their daughters have more opportunities to progress in their careers. Meanwhile, over half (53 percent) of parents think their child earns more than they did at their age, and 32 percent think their kids are on track to be much more successful in their career. Parents Misunderstand Some of Today’s Top Jobs The study also showed that parents misunderstand some of the top jobs available today: UI designer (80%) Actuary (73%) Data scientist (72%) Social media manager (67%) Sub editor (66%) Radio producer (62%) Sociologist (60%) Investment banker (59%) Software developer (58%) Fashion designer (57%) “It’s very clear that parents are proud of their child at work, yet they don’t understand the specifics of their professional world,” says Pat Wadors, SVP of Global Talent, LinkedIn. “We are thrilled to be able to inspire hundreds of companies worldwide to help connect parents to their children’s professional lives just by opening up our workplace for a day.” LinkedIn Bring In Your Parents Day is being held on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016, in 15 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Singapore, The Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States. Businesses and individuals worldwide are encouraged to take part in the day. You can find out more about the day at biyp.linkedin.com or join conversations on Twitter with #LinkedIn #BIYP.

Detailed financial information on the quarter will be available within the company's Form 10-Q filing with the SEC. “In Q3, continued product investments across our platform drove another quarter of strong engagement and financial performance,” said Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn. “As we look forward, our combination with Microsoft creates the opportunity for us to dramatically increase the impact and scale with which we deliver value to our members and customers.” During the quarter, LinkedIn’s platform continued to show strong engagement, powered by investments across mobile, messaging, content and jobs. Cumulative members grew 18% year-over-year to 467 million, and unique visiting members grew 6% to an average of 106 million members a month. Member page views grew 27% in the quarter, yielding 20% year-over-year growth in page views per unique visiting member. Mobile continues to grow at more than double the rate of overall member activity, surpassing 60% of all traffic to LinkedIn. Total revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $960 million. Talent Solutions revenue increased 24% year-over-year to $623 million. Hiring contributed $556 million in revenue, up 21% year-over-year. Learning & Development contributed $67 million in revenue. Marketing Solutions revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $175 million. Sponsored Content remained the primary driver of growth and is now approaching two-thirds of total Marketing Solutions revenue. Premium Subscriptions revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $162 million. Sales Navigator remained the faster growing component of Premium Subscriptions, across both the field and online channels. GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders was $9 million. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.06, compared to $(0.36) last year. Non-GAAP net income was $163 million, excluding $2.0 million of merger-related transaction costs. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.18, compared to $0.78 last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $304 million, or 32% of revenue. \"During the quarter, LinkedIn demonstrated strong top and bottom-line performance,\" said Steve Sordello, CFO of LinkedIn. \"Focused investments generated solid growth across our product lines as well as greater leverage across the business, resulting in record high levels of Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP EPS, and operating cash flow.\" As previously announced on June 11, 2016, LinkedIn entered into a merger agreement with Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\") under which Microsoft will acquire LinkedIn for $196.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn's net cash. On August 19, 2016, LinkedIn stockholders voted to approve the merger agreement. LinkedIn continues to expect the transaction to close prior to the end of 2016. In light of the pending merger, LinkedIn will not be updating its outlook for fiscal 2016 and will not be hosting a conference call for its third quarter 2016 business results. About LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the ways companies hire, market, and sell. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph. LinkedIn has offices around the world. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Fair value adjustment on other derivative. These adjustments represent the changes in fair value of the cash settlement feature for the preferred shares in the company's joint venture. The company excludes these fair value adjustments because they are non-cash in nature and the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Merger-related transaction costs. These adjustments represent the transaction costs associated with the Company's merger agreement with Microsoft Corporation. The company excludes the merger-related transaction costs as they are non-recurring in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and merger-related transaction costs. The company uses a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, such as tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in the valuation allowance, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excludes certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for items such as other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort.

Cloud and Distributed Computing topped the U.S. list for the second year in a row. The U.S. Top Skills of 2016 are: Cloud and Distributed Computing Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Mobile Development Storage Systems and Management User Interface Design Network and Information Security Middleware and Integration Software Web Architecture and Development Framework Algorithm Design Java Development The annual list is developed by analyzing all of the recruiting activity on LinkedIn since January, and uncovers several trends about the U.S. job market. Demand remains high for tech skills like Cloud Distributed Computing (No. 1), and Statistical Analysis and Data Mining (No. 2). That’s due to the fact that tech skills are no longer relegated to the tech industry; they’re needed in nearly every industry and region in the country. Additionally, user interface design has slowly but surely climbed the U.S. Top Skills of 2016 list — It didn’t make 2014’s list, came in at No. 7 last year, and jumped two spaces to No. 5 this year. Demand for people with user interface design skills is growing because products are increasingly data-driven, and employers need employees who can make it easy for customers to interact with their products. “While we see job applications spike on LinkedIn in October, we know companies aren’t actually hiring at the same rate until January,” says LinkedIn Career Expert Catherine Fisher. “While some skills expire every couple of years, our data strongly suggests that tech skills will still be needed for years to come, in every industry. Now is a great time for professionals to acquire the skills they need to be more marketable.” To help job seekers gain the skills needed to secure the jobs they want, LinkedIn is holding the Week of Learning from October 24-30, and offering more than 5,000 courses — including courses that teach the Top Skills of 2016 — free to professionals. Professionals can visit the Week of Learning for more information. About LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the way companies hire, market, and sell. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph. LinkedIn has more than 450 million members and has offices around the world. Methodology There are thousands of skills that members can add to their profiles, so we grouped these skills into several dozen categories. For example, skills like “Android” and “iOS” would fit into the “Mobile Development” category. Then we looked at all of the hiring and recruiting activity that happened on LinkedIn between Jan. 1 and Sept. 1, equaling billions of data points, and identified the skill categories that belonged to members who were more likely to start new jobs and receive interest from recruiters. Skill categories that did not meet a specific threshold for membership were excluded from our analysis.

The goal of endorsements is to provide a way for your connections to recognize you for your skills and expertise. The skills and endorsements on your profile help people viewing your profile understand your strengths and help you get discovered through search. This is important, because people with at least five skills listed on their LinkedIn profile receive up to 17x more profile views. While many people on LinkedIn use Endorsements, we realized that there was still more to do so we began to rethink the endorsements feature. Delivering endorsements that provide even more value required a blend of research, new machine learning models and re-architecting the backend infrastructure that both serves and recommends new endorsements. These changes to “Skills & Endorsements” means we can better surface the most relevant endorsements that help to validate your skills, including: Featuring endorsements that matter We’ve made endorsements smarter by highlighting endorsements that matter most to the viewer so you always look your best. For example, viewers will see endorsements made by mutual connections, colleagues, and people who are knowledgeable about the skill, which could give you the edge you need for your next job opportunity. Improved targeting for the most relevant endorsements We’ve improved targeting to suggest endorsements to connections that know the skills and your work best. This means the right connections are much more likely to validate you for the skills that you want to be recognized for. Tip: check that your skills are listed in order of the strengths you want to highlight and we’ll do the rest by targeting suggestions for those top skills. Now, when someone views your profile, they’ll only see the most relevant endorsements for the skills you want to highlight. With more than a third of hiring managers spending more than 60 seconds browsing your skills and endorsements, we want to make sure they’re seeing skills and endorsements that best represent your aspirations and help you stay ahead in your career. Not sure what your skills section looks like? Head over to your profile to make sure your skills are up-to-date so that your connections can help you connect to opportunity. We are rolling out the new endorsements features globally on the LinkedIn mobile app starting today, and these updates will also be available in our newly redesigned desktop soon.

These first-of-its-kind initiatives for LinkedIn, all designed and made in India are: LinkedIn Placements, LinkedIn Lite and LinkedIn Starter Pack. LinkedIn currently has more than 37 million members in India, the second-largest and one of the fast-growing markets for the company globally. Besides professionals and students, LinkedIn’s member base includes government and business leaders such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw of Biocon and Rekha Menon of Accenture. “India is a vital market for LinkedIn, as we work towards realising our vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. It’s already one of the world’s most important economies, and continues to experience strong GDP growth. While LinkedIn has grown multiple folds in India since we started operating here 6 years ago, there’s so much more we want to do here. We are committed to India and to boosting our ability to deliver value to even more members and be a part of their professional growth journey, by investing and innovating locally,” said Akshay Kothari, Country Manager and Head of Product, LinkedIn India . Mr Kothari added, “We are at the cusp of a new growth phase in India, where we are becoming even more relevant to the members and companies we serve. These new initiatives helps us keep pace with the rising demand for knowledge and access to opportunity.” Details of the three strategic initiatives are as follows: LinkedIn Lite: The majority of members access LinkedIn via mobile devices. LinkedIn Lite empowers professionals and knowledge workers to stay connected anytime, anywhere, even in areas where connectivity signals are not ideal. LinkedIn Lite is LinkedIn’s first, stripped-down mobile-website that is also data-efficient. The India team built this from scratch, with a focus on speed and efficiency of access. LinkedIn Lite loads four times faster, regardless of the mobile device and the network it is connected to, providing a fast, seamless experience to all its features and unlocking a lot of value for people in urban as well as rural areas. This product has started ramping and will be available to all Indian members in the next few weeks. LinkedIn Placements: Following the pilot launch in November 2015, LinkedIn is now opening up the Placements product to students at all colleges and universities in India. LinkedIn Placements now provides a level playing field for every student, regardless of their location or college, so that they can have a shot at their dream job opportunity. Students can log into the site to take an online assessment test, which gives them direct access to thousands of openings in 35 top corporates in India. LinkedIn is excited to partner with Aspiring Minds, CoCubes, HackerRank and Wheebox for the assessment tests. This product is now live and can be accessed at linkedin.com/placements or placements.com. “Students are the leaders of tomorrow and they hold India’s future in their hands. Some of the best talent in India live in our villages, but they have historically not had access to good opportunities. LinkedIn Placements is a game-changer for them, providing them with a unique platform to get country’s best jobs” Mr Kothari said. LinkedIn Starter Pack: The third initiative is aimed at all the ‘fireflies’ lighting up the Indian economy - startups and small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs). Exclusively designed for small, fast-growing companies, LinkedIn India takes its premium hiring, marketing and learning solutions and puts them into a single, easy-to-use package at a very special rate. This is \"LinkedIn in a box\" for SMBs and startups. This package is now live at linkedin.com/starterpack and open for applications. This package will be provided to 100 promising SMBs and startups, on a first-come, first-serve basis, in the initial pilot launch phase.

The region now represents 22 percent of LinkedIn’s global member base of over 450 million. With 37 million members, India retains its spot as the second largest market in member base terms, after the US, and the largest market in APAC. China currently accounts for more than 23 million members, while Australia has 8 million members. The member base across Southeast Asia also continues to rise, hitting 18 million including 6 million in Indonesia, 4 million in the Philippines, 3 million in Malaysia, and 1 million in Singapore. Prominent thought leaders are also on the platform as LinkedIn Influencers, including Piyush Gupta (Group CEO, DBS Bank), Hiroshi Mikitani (CEO, Rakuten Inc.), Tony Fernandes (Group CEO, AirAsia), Andrew Penn (CEO, Telstra), Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (Chairman & Managing Director, Biocon) and Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India). “The rapid pace at which we doubled our member base from 50 to 100 million members makes this milestone even more special. It also reflects a growing understanding of the economic value of personal branding and a global professional network. At this scale, LinkedIn is in an even stronger position to help members connect to economic opportunity, whether it’s a new job, a promotion or other business opportunities,” said Olivier Legrand, Managing Director, LinkedIn Asia Pacific and Japan. To enhance the experiences of its fast-growing member base in the region, including speed and reliability of access to the platform, LinkedIn unveiled its S$80 million data centre in Singapore in April 2016, its first outside of the US. Legrand added, “With 40 percent or 280 million of the world’s professionals living and working in Asia Pacific, there’s still plenty of runway for us to grow, particularly in the segments related to students and young professionals, the fastest-growing demographic on LinkedIn. As the region continues to gain momentum as a key economic driver, we can’t wait to see our members become even more successful and extend their influence across the world.” Insights into LinkedIn members in Asia Pacific: Global connections: Outside of the APAC region, the US and UK are among the top 3 countries that members are connected to, in addition to other professionals in their respective home countries. “Social Selling”: In APAC, professionals are using LinkedIn to grow their business and career. Across markets like Australia, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, salesperson emerged as the most common occupation on LinkedIn, followed by business owners. Professionals avoid “cold-calling” and leverage social connections to initiate “warm introductions”, build relationships with prospects and customers to grow their businesses. Interest in content: Professionals in APAC are also consuming and engaging with content on issues and global challenges that are relevant to them professionally. For example, in the last 90 days in Singapore, China and Hong Kong, “European Union” emerged amongst the top 10 most popular topics in view of the recent news on Brexit. Topics on “Recruiting” and “employee engagement” are top-of-mind for professionals across the region.

Supplemental financials will be available on the investor relations section of the LinkedIn website at http://investors.linkedin.com. On June 11, 2016, LinkedIn entered into a merger agreement with Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\") under which Microsoft will acquire LinkedIn for $196.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn's net cash. “In Q2, we demonstrated good momentum with our member and customers, and delivered strong financial results,” said Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn. “Continued product innovation drove increased levels of engagement, and strengthened our enterprise offerings. We believe joining forces with Microsoft enables us to further accelerate and scale our ability to deliver value and create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.\" In the quarter, our core member operating metrics reflected continued strength. Cumulative members grew 18% year-over-year to 450 million, unique visiting members grew 9% to an average of 106 million members a month, and member page views grew 32%. This yielded 21% year-over-year growth in page views per unique visiting member, continuing a pattern of strong engagement growth over the past several quarters. Total revenue increased 31% year-over-year to $933 million. Talent Solutions revenue increased 35% year-over-year to $597 million. Hiring contributed $535 million in revenue, up 26% year-over-year. Learning & Development contributed $62 million in revenue. Marketing Solutions revenue increased 29% year-over-year to $181 million. Sponsored Content surpassed 60% of total Marketing Solutions revenue and was the primary driver of growth, driven largely by increase in customer demand. Premium Subscriptions revenue increased 21% year-over-year to $155 million. Sales Navigator remained the faster growing component of Premium Subscriptions, with growth in the field channel continuing to outpace growth in individual online subscriptions. GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders was $119 million, primarily driven by a non-cash charge of $101 million as a result of recording a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our tax assets. GAAP diluted EPS was $(0.89), compared to last year's performance of $(0.53). Non-GAAP net income was $153 million, excluding $14 million of merger-related transaction costs. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.13, compared to $0.55 last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $292 million, or 31% of revenue. \"LinkedIn delivered another quarter of strong growth,\" said Steve Sordello, CFO of LinkedIn. \"We achieved record levels of operating cash flow, while continuing to invest heavily across our core member and customer value propositions.\" In light of the pending merger, LinkedIn will not be updating its outlook for fiscal 2016 and will not be hosting a conference call for its second quarter 2016 business results.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Fair value adjustment on other derivative. These adjustments represent the changes in fair value of the cash settlement feature for the preferred shares in the company's joint venture. The company excludes these fair value adjustments because they are non-cash in nature and the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Merger-related transaction costs. This adjustment represents the transaction costs associated with the Company's merger agreement with Microsoft Corporation. The company excludes the merger-related transaction costs as they are non-recurring in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and merger-related transaction costs. The company uses a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, such as tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in the valuation allowance, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excludes certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for items such as other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort.

(Nasdaq: MSFT) and LinkedIn Corporation (NYSE: LNKD) on Monday announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Microsoft will acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn’s net cash. LinkedIn will retain its distinct brand, culture and independence. Jeff Weiner will remain CEO of LinkedIn, reporting to Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. Reid Hoffman, chairman of the board, co-founder and controlling shareholder of LinkedIn, and Weiner both fully support this transaction. The transaction is expected to close this calendar year. LinkedIn is the world’s largest and most valuable professional network and continues to build a strong and growing business. Over the past year, the company has launched a new version of its mobile ​app that has led to increased member engagement; enhanced the LinkedIn newsfeed to deliver better business insights; acquired a leading online learning platform called Lynda.com to enter a new market; and rolled out a new version of its Recruiter product to its enterprise customers. These innovations have resulted in increased membership, engagement and financial results, specifically: 19 percent growth year over year (YOY) to more than 433 million members worldwide 9 percent growth YOY to more than 105 million unique visiting members per month 49 percent growth YOY to 60 percent mobile usage 34 percent growth YOY to more than 45 billion quarterly member page views 101 percent growth YOY to more than 7 million active job listings “The LinkedIn team has grown a fantastic business centered on connecting the world’s professionals,” Nadella said. “Together we can accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet.” “Just as we have changed the way the world connects to opportunity, this relationship with Microsoft, and the combination of their cloud and LinkedIn’s network, now gives us a chance to also change the way the world works,” Weiner said. “For the last 13 years, we’ve been uniquely positioned to connect professionals to make them more productive and successful, and I’m looking forward to leading our team through the next chapter of our story.” The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both LinkedIn and Microsoft. The deal is expected to close this calendar year and is subject to approval by LinkedIn’s shareholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. “Today is a re-founding moment for LinkedIn. I see incredible opportunity for our members and customers and look forward to supporting this new and combined business,” said Hoffman. “I fully support this transaction and the Board’s decision to pursue it, and will vote my shares in accordance with their recommendation on it.\" Microsoft will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. Upon closing, Microsoft expects LinkedIn’s financials to be reported as part of Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes segment. Microsoft expects the acquisition to have minimal dilution of ~1 percent to non-GAAP earnings per share for the remainder of fiscal year 2017 post-closing and for fiscal year 2018 based on the expected close date, and become accretive to Microsoft’s non-GAAP earnings per share in Microsoft’s fiscal year 2019 or less than two years post-closing. Non-GAAP includes stock-based compensation expense consistent with Microsoft’s reporting practice, and excludes expected impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related expenses.

Prepared Remarks — Jeff Weiner, CEO LinkedIn Corporation Q1 was a strong start to the year as LinkedIn once again delivered results that exceeded our plan. I want to highlight three key themes from the quarter. First, engagement materially strengthened across our member platform, driven by our new flagship experience. Second, our core monetization products — Recruiter and Sponsored Updates — showed continued growth, while our emerging strategic investments such as Sales Navigator and Learning & Development continue to show progress. And third, we saw significant improvements in our ability to increase ROI across the business. For Q1, overall revenues grew 35% to $861 million. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $222 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.74 cents. In the quarter, cumulative members grew 19% to 433 million, our strongest net-add quarter since the beginning of 2014. Our core operating metrics saw accelerated growth — unique visiting members grew 9% to an average of 106 million members a month and member page views grew 34%. Page views per unique visiting member hit an all-time high in Q1, with 23% year-over-year growth. Q1 marked the first full quarter for our new mobile flagship experience, and we are pleased with the performance thus far. Members are engaging at record levels with the more relevant and comprehensive feed. During the quarter, viral actions increased more than 80%, daily shares were up nearly 40%, and traffic to third-party publishers grew more than 150%. We also continue to see significant growth in other core engagement metrics, such as profile edits, connections made, and messages sent. Additionally, we saw record levels of activity in our jobs products. Total jobs unique visitors hit a record high in Q1, up more than 20% versus last year. Job applicants from our mobile flagship app also reached record highs, up more than 50%. As job seekers find more value on LinkedIn, our hiring business directly benefits. For Talent Solutions, in Q1 we strengthened our core Recruiter product while also laying the groundwork for the roll-out of a number of emerging growth drivers. The next generation of Recruiter, unveiled late last year, is the foundation of our long-term growth strategy. Recruiters are experiencing greater success with the new product, and effectiveness has increased substantially. Currently, the number of candidates viewed per search is up more than 40%, and InMails per search are up more than 30%. By the end of Q2, we expect the majority of our customers to have converted to the new version of Recruiter. Additionally, newer products such as Referrals and Connectifier are coming online to help customers drive a greater share of hiring through LinkedIn. And the increased member engagement with jobs is already delivering a stronger pipeline of potential candidates to our existing customers. In Marketing Solutions, our re-doubled focus on Sponsored Content is already paying dividends. In Q1, Sponsored Content grew nearly 80%, now representing 56% of total Marketing Solutions revenue. On top of greater demand, increased feed engagement resulted in more opportunities for marketers to reach their target audiences. We also began piloting the sale of sponsored content through off network inventory. Additionally, by virtue of leveraging our LinkedIn Lead Accelerator team and technology, conversion tracking and enhanced campaign analytics are coming online faster than we expected. By the end of 2016, we anticipate a Sponsored Content customer will be able to expand targeting using their own data such as customer account lists, use conversion tracking to better measure their return on investment, and leverage improved tools including APIs to better manage their campaigns, all of which will ultimately drive even higher ROI. In addition to our core businesses, Sales Solutions and Learning & Development represent two longer-term focus areas. For Sales Solutions, we continue to focus on enhancing Sales Navigator to become the primary system of engagement for sales professionals. During the quarter, we continued to make good progress simplifying the integration with CRM systems, enabling seat holders to see more value faster. We also remain focused working with customers globally to help measure and drive their ROI. For example, Sales Navigator influenced $350 million in closed business at HCL, a global business services firm, demonstrating the significant potential of social selling. Regarding Learning & Development, we are now turning our attention from integrating the Lynda.com team, to integrating their technology and content. Two examples are the launch of LinkedIn Learning Paths, aggregating relevant content from across LinkedIn relating to a specific topic or course, and testing deeper integration into relevant LinkedIn subscription packages. On the enterprise side, we continue to build out the comprehensiveness of our content library to meet the growing demand from our corporate customers. In closing, Q1 represented a strong quarter for both our member platform and business lines, with increasing engagement via our Flagship app strengthening the foundation for continued growth across our diverse enterprise offerings. At the same time, we remain focused on long-term profitability by driving greater leverage and ROI across our entire portfolio. Lastly, I want to thank all of our employees, who have continued to make this possible while embodying our culture and values. I'll now turn it over to Steve for a deeper dive into our operating metrics and financials. Prepared Remarks — Steve Sordello, CFO LinkedIn Corporation We achieved strong performance during the quarter, underscoring progress across member engagement, and in our core and emerging businesses. We also improved the return on our investment, as revenue growth was accompanied by an increase in adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. With respect to revenue, in Q1 we generated $861 million in total sales, growth of 35% year-over-year, or 38% on a constant currency basis. Talent Solutions revenue, comprised of Hiring and Learning & Development increased to $558 million up 41% year-over-year, and represented 65% of sales versus 62% last year. Within Hiring, revenue grew 27% year-over-year, or 30% on a constant currency basis. For field sales, we’re encouraged by solid fundamentals: Existing customers continue to grow their spend with LinkedIn: Larger enterprises represent approximately 70% of customer spend, and we’ve seen healthy growth over the past couple years in existing customer spending. We also continued to see engagement increase across our product suite, as measured by jobs posted, job applications, and inMails sent. In addition, we saw a better than expected impact from pricing, while churn levels were consistent with last year, helping maintain per customer spending growth. For new customers, growth remained strong as we added a healthy level of new accounts, with modest acceleration in large enterprise customer additions. Our online channel, composed of online jobs and subscription products for individual job seekers and recruiters, benefited from two factors. First, new subscribers continued shifting to Job Seeker and Recruiter Lite from Premium Subscriptions. This shift dates back to the Q4’14 subscriber on-boarding changes, which we will begin to lap in the 2nd half of 2016. More importantly, we saw a positive impact from increased engagement and product improvements. Learning & Development continues to be an area of longer-term focus, and contributed $55 million during the quarter. Important initiatives in 2016 include integrating learning content into the LinkedIn platform, and beginning to grow our enterprise effort, given the building early demand with corporate customers. Marketing Solutions increased 29% to $154 million, or 31% on a constant currency basis, and represented 18% of revenue versus 19% last year. Sponsored Content continued its strong performance, growing nearly 80% in the quarter. Product improvements drove significant improvements in click through, resulting in increased ROI for customers. Growth in delivered impressions came from greater feed engagement and strong customer demand. Sponsored Content strength also helped ease the secular transition from display. As expected, Premium Display declined approximately 30%, and now represents roughly 10% of overall Marketing Solutions. As mentioned last quarter, we are testing programmatic sales in right-rail inventory, an area we will continue to explore throughout 2016. The decision to focus primarily on Sponsored Content began to payoff in the first quarter, and we’ll continue to focus our investment to better integrate the Lead Accelerator technology into the Sponsored Content platform. Premium Subscriptions grew to $149 million up 22% year-over-year, or 25% growth on a constant currency basis, and contributed 17% of revenue versus 19% last year. Sales Solutions grew approximately 55% year-over-year, and now represents 40% of Premium Subscription revenue. The Field channel is growing substantially faster than individual online subscriptions, and enterprise customers continue to see increased value in Sales Navigator. Within these customers, high product satisfaction and lower churn give us conviction in the future potential of this business. The remainder of Premium Subscriptions comes from our General Subscriptions SKU. This product grew approximately 7% year-over-year, muted in part by the previously discussed changes in subscriber on-boarding. Looking across the four individual subscription products on the LinkedIn platform (Gen Subs, Job Seeker, Recruiter Lite, and Sales Navigator), we saw healthy growth in the 20% range in the first quarter. In terms of geography, non-US sales represented 39% of overall revenue, consistent with last year, or 41% on a constant currency basis. We saw better than expected results in EMEA across all of our product lines. By channel, field sales contributed 62% of revenue, consistent with last year. Moving to the non-GAAP financials, adjusted EBITDA was $222 million, a 26% margin. Depreciation was $95 million, amortization of intangibles was $47 million, and stock compensation totaled $146 million. GAAP net loss was $46 million, resulting in a $0.35 cent loss per share, compared to loss of $43 million and $0.34 cent loss per share last year. Non-GAAP net income was $99 million, resulting in earnings of $0.74 cents per share, compared with $73 million and $0.57 cents last year. The balance sheet remains well positioned with $3.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. Operating cash flow was a record $252 million versus $165 million a year ago, and free cash flow was $75 million in light of our continued investments in data centers and facilities. With respect to capex, we expect to see increased leverage beginning in 2017 as we exit what has been a period of strategic investment in data centers and facilities to support our long-term growth. In terms of data centers, we will complete building out the majority of our global footprint by the end of 2016, on track with the plan we originally discussed in 2014. We have begun to realize improved reliability and increased site speed, made possible by our new self-managed infrastructure. We will also improve our cost structure given that we expect to realize greater than 40% in future opex savings within cost of revenue. For facilities, we have executed on a plan that aligns our global office footprint with our long-term business needs and we plan to exit our growth investment cycle in late 2017. Turning to guidance, I will end the call with our outlook for the second quarter and updated view of the full year. For the second quarter, we expect: Revenue of approximately $885-890 million, representing approximately 25% percent growth. Adjusted EBITDA of between $225-230 million, a 26% margin. Non-GAAP EPS of between $0.74 -$0.77 cents per share. For the full year, we’ve increased our outlook and now expect: Revenue between $3.65 and $3.70 billion, a range of 22% to 24% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $985 million - $1.005 billion, a 27% margin. And non-GAAP EPS of approximately $3.30 to $3.40 per share. For stock-based compensation, our 2016 equity grant will result in 100 basis points of GAAP margin expansion this year vs prior guidance. Overall, stock compensation is an area of focus and we expect to see continued progress towards lowering this expense as a percentage of revenue going forward. For 2016, we expect approximately $150 million for Q2 and $580 million for the full year. Depreciation of approximately $93 million for Q2 and $395 million for the full year, with second quarter amortization of approximately $44 million and $173 million for the full year. For other expenses, on a non-GAAP basis we expect approximately $2 million for Q2 and $4 million for the full year. On a GAAP basis, we expect $16 million for the second quarter, and $63 million for the full year; this includes GAAP-only convertible accretion expenses and the impact from the financial derivative related to our Chinese JV. A non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for Q2 and for the full year. Also as it relates to tax, as mentioned last quarter, we expect to take a GAAP charge of approximately $100 million in the second quarter of 2016, the result of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. As this is a non-cash charge, this will not impact our non-GAAP results. For capex for the full year, we continue to expect approximately mid-high teens % of revenue, reflecting ongoing data center and facility investments. And for the share count: On a GAAP basis, we expect 134 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q2, and an average of 135 million for the full year. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 136 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q2 and for the full year. In closing, we are off to a good start to 2016. We have building momentum in member engagement, achieved solid results in our core and emerging businesses, and generated strong adjusted EBITDA and record operating cash flow. Finally, we are positioned to create greater leverage through increasing profitability and growing free cash flow. As we invest for the long term, we will continue to pursue the realization of our mission while focusing on capturing the large and growing opportunity ahead of us.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Fair value adjustment on other derivative. These adjustments represent the changes in fair value of the cash settlement feature for the preferred shares in the company's joint venture. The company excludes these fair value adjustments because they are non-cash in nature and the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company uses a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excludes certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort.

The new data centre, spanning 23,500 square feet in Jurong, is one of six data centres for LinkedIn globally. LinkedIn has invested SGD $80 million so far in the new data centre, which was established to enhance the experience for the fast-growing base of LinkedIn members and clients across the Asia Pacific region, including speed and reliability of access to LinkedIn’s services as they connect to professional opportunities on the network. Since January 2013, the number of LinkedIn members in the Asia Pacific more than doubled to reach over 85 million members at the end of 2015. This includes 16+ million members in Southeast Asia (of which 1+ million are in Singapore), 34+ million in India and 7+ million in Australia. LinkedIn also counts prominent leaders as its influencers, including Narendra Modi (Prime Minister of India), Piyush Gupta (CEO of DBS Bank), Tony Fernandes (Group CEO of AirAsia), Shinzo Abe (Prime Minister of Japan) and Andrew Penn (CEO of Telstra). Over the same period, LinkedIn’s revenue in the region more than tripled. The new data centre in Singapore processes all of LinkedIn’s online traffic in the Asia Pacific region and will also handle about a third of global traffic. It will also complement the continuing growth in LinkedIn’s storage and processing needs globally – in 2015, this growth was 34 percent. The smart design features are also expected to reduce the annual energy consumption of the data centre by a magnitude that is equivalent to powering about 100 private homes in Singapore. For more information about the data centre, please click here. “Asia Pacific is our fastest growing region in terms of member base outside of the US. We are investing to make sure we continue to provide a great experience as our business continues to grow in this region”, said Olivier Legrand, Managing Director of LinkedIn in Asia Pacific. “Singapore is the natural choice for us to locate this new data centre, as it is already our Asia Pacific Head Quarters, and it offers the cutting-edge infrastructure and talent we need to continue to improve the service and global connectivity we provide to our members and clients”, he added. LinkedIn worked with the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) to deepen its presence in Singapore, including the establishment of the new data centre. This is in line with EDB’s vision for Singapore to be the digital capital of Asia. “We’re delighted that LinkedIn has chosen Singapore as the location for its new investments. The establishment of the data centre reinforces our position as the region’s leading data management and connectivity hub,” said Mr. Kiren Kumar, Executive Director Infocomms & Media, Singapore Economic Development Board.

The transcript with prepared remarks is contained within this press release. In addition, a supplemental presentation will be made available on the investor relations section of the LinkedIn website at http://investors.linkedin.com. “Q4 was a strong quarter for LinkedIn, bringing to a close a successful year of growth and innovation against our long-term roadmap,” said Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn. “We enter 2016 with increased focus on core initiatives that will drive leverage across our portfolio of products.” During the quarter, LinkedIn made solid progress against its long-term product strategy to create value for members by connecting them to opportunity. We launched our reimagined flagship app in December, created a more streamlined experience for members to follow personalized and relevant content in the feed, and continued to scale the number of jobs on the platform to now more than six million open listings. Revenue increased 34% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $862 million and increased 35% in 2015 to $2,991 million. Talent Solutions revenue (inclusive of Learning & Development) increased 45% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $535 million and increased 41% year-over-year to $1,877 million in 2015. Hiring revenue contributed $487 million and $1,770 million in the fourth quarter and 2015, respectively, which represents increases of 32% and 33% compared to the same periods last year. These increases were driven by strength in new account performance within field sales and continued strength in online subscriptions. Learning & Development revenue contributed $49 million and $107 million in the fourth quarter and 2015, respectively. Marketing Solutions revenue increased 20% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $183 million and increased 28% to $581 million in 2015. Sponsored Updates performance was the primary driver of growth, surpassing 50% of total Marketing Solutions revenue for the first time, while premium display faced secular-driven headwinds similar to prior quarters. Premium Subscriptions revenue increased 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $144 million and increased 22% year-over-year to $532 million in 2015. Sales Navigator remained the faster growing component of Premium Subscriptions with continued improvement in customer satisfaction and product usage. Adjusted EBITDA was $249 million in the fourth quarter, or 29% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $780 million in 2015, or 26% of revenue. GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders was $8 million in the fourth quarter and $166 million in 2015. Non-GAAP net income was $126 million in the fourth quarter and $373 million in 2015.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Fair value adjustment on other derivative. These adjustments represent the changes in fair value of the cash settlement feature for the preferred shares in the company's joint venture. This non-GAAP adjustment is the result of the company's modified retrospective adoption in the fourth quarter of 2015 of authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedges. The company excludes these fair value adjustments because they are non-cash in nature and the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company uses a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excludes certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort.

Prepared Remarks — Jeff Weiner, CEO LinkedIn Corporation Q3 was a strong quarter for LinkedIn. Our member-facing product pipeline has never been stronger, and recent roll-outs are driving continued positive engagement trends. In terms of our business lines, Talent Solutions performed well, while Marketing Solutions remained stable. We also made good progress in Sales Solutions and lynda.com, our more nascent opportunities, which are future growth drivers for the company. For Q3, overall revenues grew 37% to $780 million. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $208 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.78 cents. Q3 cumulative members grew 20% to 396 million, and last week reached the 400 million member milestone. Unique visiting members grew 11% to an average of 100 million per month, and member page views grew 33%. This has yielded 20% year over year growth in page views per unique visiting member, continuing a pattern of accelerated growth throughout 2015. This is in part a result of placing more emphasis on quality engagement for our members and less on transactional engagement generated by emails. Mobile continues to grow at double the rate of overall member activity, and now represents 55% of all traffic to LinkedIn. LinkedIn’s value proposition is simple - connect to opportunity. For our members, this means three things: connect to your professional world, stay informed through professional news and knowledge, and get hired and build your career. In 2015, we made substantial progress on delivering these value propositions. Here are a few highlights of the progress we’ve made since our last earnings call. We continued to expand the LinkedIn network globally. Since our last call, China has continued to accelerate the absolute number of signups, and now has more than 13 million members, up more than 3x since early 2014 when we launched our local language version. Though still early, we are also seeing strong sign-ups and engagement for Chitu, our first professional networking app designed specifically for the Chinese market. In Q3, we replaced the traditional Inbox with Messaging, a more lightweight and casual communications interface. While still early, but we have already seen a double digit percentage increase in the number of messages sent between members, and a significant lift in one day reply rates. Messaging is already available for our English-language members, and we are in the process of completing the roll out globally. Finally, a few weeks ago, we previewed the next generation of LinkedIn’s mobile flagship experience. This new app was developed mobile first; does fewer things better; and is faster, simpler, and more personalized. It’s structured around five key pillars - the Feed, Profile, My Network, Messaging, and Search - and will launch next month. In 2016, these pillars will also serve as the foundation for the ongoing evolution of our desktop site. Connecting our members to relevant news, knowledge, and skills is another strategic priority integral to creating member value. Our publishing platform is central to this effort. In Q3, the number of long-form posts published per week reached more than 150,000. We also recently added the ability to post long-form content in more languages, including Portuguese, French, and German. And last week, we welcomed Oprah Winfrey to the Influencer platform. Lastly, helping members get hired is one of the fastest growing areas of engagement on LinkedIn. We continue to increase the scale of jobs on the platform, with more than 4 million active job listings today, compared to roughly 1 million a year ago. Monthly job page views were up over 90% year over year in September, and we have seen a 75% year over year increase in applications to those jobs. Creating value for our members enables us to transform the way our customers Hire, Market, and Sell on a global basis through our three diverse product lines. In Q3, Talent Solutions grew 46% to $502 million, inclusive of Learning & Development revenue from lynda.com; Marketing Solutions was up 28% to $140 million; and Premium Subscriptions, which includes Sales Solutions, increased 21% to $138 million. For Talent Solutions, Q3 saw continued strength stemming from the sales force realignment done at the start of the year. We have been investing in Talent Solutions R&D throughout 2015, and we now have the most powerful pipeline of new products for recruiters in our history. At Talent Connect, we announced two of our biggest - LinkedIn Referrals, and a completely revamped Recruiter platform. Both products enable employers to more easily leverage better data and employee relationships to hire the right talent faster. Referrals is expected to launch in November, and the new Recruiter early next year. The ongoing integration of lynda.com progressed in Q3 with the launch of new LinkedIn Influencer courses and new features for our members. And the enterprise business remains strong; last quarter, lynda signed an existing customer to multi-year renewal for more than four million dollars, the largest deal in its history. For Marketing Solutions, we continue to create a more scalable business and become the most effective platform for marketers to engage professionals. In Q3, Sponsored Updates accounted for approximately half of all Marketing Solutions revenue, and continues to grow in excess of 100% year over year. In Sales Solutions, we launched a new Sales Navigator homepage with integrated Social Selling Index data. Sales Navigator customer satisfaction continued to increase during Q3. In addition, the field sales team is seeing early success with a “land and expand” go to market strategy. Additionally, just this week, LinkedIn and EY agreed on the largest single deal in our history, leveraging Sales Navigator as a platform, as well as a go-to-market alliance to help accelerate our respective growth in the business-to-business enterprise market. Our collaboration with EY will enable us to leverage EY’s extensive capabilities, footprint and global reach. Together, we’ll help companies develop deeper and more trusted customer relationships through social and data analytics. We believe this strategic relationship will lead to collaboration and co-creation of solutions, generating opportunities for both of our organizations. Lastly, LinkedIn @ Work, our newest value proposition for our customers, continues to gain momentum. In August, we launched LinkedIn LookUp, a standalone app that allows members to find and contact co-workers. And in September, we announced the general availability of LinkedIn Elevate to all large enterprises. Nearly all of the pilot partners up for renewal have purchased the product. As we think about 2016, we expect to accelerate our focus on how we integrate all of these assets to help enterprises hire, market, and sell by using LinkedIn to connect to opportunity. Finally, a word about our Talent, our most important operating priority. In Q3, we made strong progress on hiring senior level engineering talent, as well as hiring a record number of engineering managers, both of which are key objectives for us in 2015. This traction enables us to scale faster and deliver our product roadmap more effectively. And now, I’ll turn it over to Steve for a deeper dive into our operating metrics and financials. Prepared Remarks — Steve Sordello, CFO LinkedIn Corporation Today I will discuss growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless indicated otherwise, and non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, and the tax impacts of these adjustments. During the third quarter, we demonstrated strong financial performance, and made significant progress on our long-term product roadmap for both members and customers. With respect to revenue, in Q3 we generated $780 million in total sales, an increase of 37% year-over-year, or 43% on a constant currency basis. While lynda contributed approximately $41 million to revenue in its first full quarter post acquisition, the vast majority of our out performance relative to guidance was driven by the core business. Talent Solutions, showed strong performance, with revenue of $502 million growing 46% year-over-year, and represented 64% of sales versus 61% last year. Within our Hiring business, revenue grew 34% year-over-year, or 39% on a constant currency basis. In our field sales channel, we saw nice year-over-year improvement in both churn and the net ratio. We also saw steady growth in new customers as we approach nearly 40,000 enterprise accounts under contract. Our online channel is where small companies turn to LinkedIn on a self-serve basis, and in Q3 showed solid growth. All three online products - Recruiter Lite, Job Seeker, and online jobs - exhibited strength, the result of an upgraded customer experience. Learning & Development contributed $41 million in the first full quarter following the lynda acquisition. Our product and go-to-market teams have focused on growing lynda’s existing business, and we plan to begin launching more integrated consumer and enterprise products in 2016. Marketing Solutions grew 28% to $140 million, or 34% on a constant currency basis, and represented 18% of revenue versus 19% last year. Sponsored Updates maintained strong momentum, and continues to be the driver of our advertising business. Sponsored Updates represented nearly 50% of marketing revenue, and once again grew in excess of 100% year-over-year. Recent growth has been driven by increased customer demand, aided by the launch of our new online campaign manager. As expected, CPM-based premium display continued to face secular-driven headwinds. We experienced similar trends as compared with last quarter with revenue decreasing in the mid 30% range year-over-year. Premium display now represents approximately 15% of the Marketing Solutions mix compared with approximately 30% last year. As Sponsored Updates continues to grow, we expect premium display to contribute a smaller portion of our long-term mix. We also remained focused on the B2B opportunity and continue to evolve our recently launched LinkedIn Lead Accelerator product. During the quarter, we saw churn decrease due to the emphasis on annual vs. quarterly campaigns. Premium Subscriptions grew to $138 million up 21% year-over-year, or 26% growth on a constant currency basis, and contributed 18% of revenue versus 20% last year. Sales Solutions remained the faster growing component of Premium, now representing over one-third of this revenue line. We continue to make both product and go-to-market gains as this new business enters its second year. In addition to introducing Sales Navigator to new enterprise customers like EY, we continue to gain traction with our land and expand play book. Microsoft provides a terrific example, having grown their social selling practice from 15 Sales Navigator seats to more than 3,000 in less than two years. In the process, their social selling reps have seen a nearly 40% increase in productivity when compared to traditional sales reps. General subscriptions still represents the majority of premium revenue, though since launching the new on-boarding experience late last year, we continue to see the individual subscriber mix shift towards Job Seeker and Recruiter Lite which are both reported within Talent Solutions. In terms of geography, revenue generated outside the US represented 38% of overall revenue versus 40% last year, or 40% this quarter on a constant currency basis. EMEA performed well showing acceleration during the quarter, and APAC showed nice improvement as well. By channel, field sales contributed 62% of revenue versus 60% last year. While a smaller portion of our revenue, higher margin online products performed well during the quarter, especially within Talent Solutions. Moving to the non-GAAP financials, Adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, a 27% margin. This exceeded our expectations with revenue driving over half of our out performance, the vast majority coming from the core business, with especially strong performance from high-margin online products. The remainder of over performance was tied to lower expenses oriented across several areas including lynda and facilities. Depreciation and Amortization totaled $118 million while stock compensation was $127 million. GAAP net loss was $41 million, resulting in a $0.31 loss per share, compared to a loss of $4 million and $0.03 last year. Non-GAAP net income was $103 million, resulting in earnings of $0.78 per share, compared with $66 million and $0.52 last year. The balance sheet remains well positioned with $3.1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Operating cash flow was $240 million versus $181 million a year ago, and free cash flow was $73 million, up from $61 million last year. Note, capex increased meaningfully quarter over quarter as we began the buildout of our third self-managed data center. I will end the call with guidance for the fourth quarter and an updated outlook for 2015. For the fourth quarter: We expect revenue between $845 and $850 million, 32% growth at the midpoint. We expect Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $210 million, a 25% margin. For non-GAAP EPS, we expect approximately $0.74 per share. For the full year: We expect revenue between approximately $2.975 and $2.980 billion, representing growth of 34% year-over-year. This represents an increase of $35 - $40 million compared to prior guidance. The majority of the out performance was driven by Q3 results, with the remaining increase from a slight up-tick in our Q4 outlook for both our core business and lynda. We expect Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $740 million, a 25% margin. This represents an increase of approximately $75 million compared to prior guidance, with Q3 out performance of about $60 million. For non-GAAP EPS, we expect approximately $2.63 per share. I will now provide some additional context on guidance. With respect to revenue in the fourth quarter: Within Hiring, Learning & Development, and Sales Solutions, we expect healthy underlying trends to continue, albeit compared against a particularly strong Q4 in 2014. For Marketing Solutions specifically, we expect Sponsored Updates to continue to drive our growth, offsetting consistent secular display headwinds and our first full quarter with a year-over-year comparison post the Bizo acquisition last year. We also expect an approximately 5% growth headwind relative to F/X, unchanged from our previous Q4 outlook. With respect to Adjusted EBITDA guidance: We expect greater expense impact from a heavier quarter of sales rep hiring, greater field sales seasonality after a particularly strong online quarter in Q3, and ongoing investments in key areas including China and our member platform as we launch the new flagship app. Lastly, I want to touch on how improvements to member-facing products will impact engagement metrics in the short-term: First, we are streamlining our new mobile app thereby decreasing the number of page views necessary to deliver a high quality experience. Specifically, more intuitive tabbed browsing replaces a dedicated navigation page, creating more seamless interaction. Second, we continue to remove emails and other transactional pages that generate lower value engagement to the site. This creates a better experience and long-term value for members, but will have a short-term impact on page view growth, especially when compared against a heavy transactional period like Q4’2014. Both initiatives reflect our commitment and investment in the member platform. Throughout 2015, we have increasingly seen deeper member interaction across our core value propositions, including greater than 90% growth in traffic to jobs, and publishing content growing two times faster than the overall site. We look forward to sharing continued progress as we further innovate on our member platform. Additional guidance incorporates: Depreciation of approximately $78 million for Q4 and $281 million for the full year, with fourth quarter amortization of approximately $47 million and $135 million for the full year. Stock based compensation of approximately $135 million for Q4 and approximately $510 million for the full year. Other expense of approximately $16 million for Q4 and $57 million for the full year, including GAAP-only convertible accretion of $12 million in Q4 and $46 million for the full year. In addition in Q4 we are evaluating and may adopt new accounting guidance with regard to our China JV, which increases the volatility of non-cash other expense. A Non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for Q4 and the full year. Capex of approximately 20% of revenue for the full year, reflecting the 2nd half data center build-out. And for the share count: On a GAAP basis, we expect 132 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q4, and an average of 129 million for the full year. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 134 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q4 and an average of 131 million for the full year. In closing, LinkedIn delivered strong performance during the third quarter. As we end the year, our focus remains on the long-term realization of our mission and vision. This is an exciting period for LinkedIn as our product innovation takes root with complete re-designs of both our flagship mobile app and recruiter platform. We will continue to focus on areas that drive the greatest long-term business impact, while scaling our platform to create the most value for our members and customers.

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph. LinkedIn has offices around the world. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort.

Prepared Remarks — Jeff Weiner, CEO LinkedIn I’ll start by summarizing the operating results for the second quarter of 2015, and I’ll recap some of the key milestones that demonstrate the execution of our strategy. I’ll then turn it over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers and outlook. Q2 was a solid quarter for LinkedIn as we delivered greater member and customer value. We continue to execute against an ambitious R&D roadmap that has led to accelerated product innovation with new product rollouts throughout the remainder of this year. We also made progress working through transitions with our Talent Solutions sales force and the evolution of our Marketing Solutions business. Additionally, we have seen some early success integrating lynda.com. For Q2, overall revenues grew 33% to $712 million. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $163 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 cents. Q2 cumulative members grew 21% to 380 million, unique visiting members grew 16% to an average of 97 million per month, and member page views grew 37%, an acceleration over Q1’s growth rate and well ahead of unique member growth. Mobile continues to grow at double the rate of overall member activity, and now represents 52% of all traffic to LinkedIn. LinkedIn’s value proposition is simple -- connect to opportunity. For our members, we do this in three ways: first, connect to your professional world; second, stay informed through professional news and knowledge; and third, get hired and build your career. Our long term investments in these areas are designed with one goal in mind: transform the member experience to increase the value delivered to each professional on LinkedIn. Here are a few highlights of the progress we’ve made on delivering these value propositions since our last earnings call. In Q2, we continued to invest in improving the quality and relevance of the flagship LinkedIn experience. These investments resulted in a 60% increase in year over year feed engagement and search growing meaningfully faster than overall traffic. And we’ve also taken steps to improve the relevance of communication across LinkedIn, recognizing that when it comes to your inbox, less is more. The results so far have been very encouraging. For every 10 emails we used to send, we’ve removed 4 of them. Member complaints regarding emails have been cut in half as a result of this effort. You can expect to see more from us in this area as the year continues. Additionally, our continuing investment in these foundations set the stage for re-envisioning our entire core mobile and desktop experience. Over time, our flagship offering will increasingly focus on five key pillars -- the Feed, Profile, My Network, Messaging, and Search. The global expansion of LinkedIn is also a core part of connecting members to their professional world. We recently reached the 10 million member milestone in China, up from 4 million last February, and China is now our second largest market for new signups behind the US. We have built strategic relationships with many of the largest Chinese web platforms including WeChat, QQMail, Alibaba, and Alipay. Also, this month, our local Chinese development team beta-launched a new app called “Chitu”. Chitu, our first professional networking app designed exclusively for the Chinese market, is currently invitation-only. Despite that, early interest is strong, reaching tens of thousands of signups in the first three days since launch. Connecting our members to relevant news, knowledge, and skills is another strategic priority integral to creating member value. Our publishing platform is a key element in this effort. In Q2, the number of long-form posts per week increased to more than 130,000, and we now have more than 1 million unique members publishing long-form content on the site, a scale that we believe is unprecedented in the history of professional publishing. In addition, our Influencer platform continues to see strong usage by professional luminaires, and we were pleased to see both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush begin publishing on LinkedIn as they launched their presidential campaigns. This collective professional knowledge, along with third party content, is distributed through Pulse. In Q2, we launched a completely revamped version of the app. The new Pulse offers a more personalized news experience, powered by your professional world, and has quickly risen to become one of the most popular business news apps. Finally, in May we completed the acquisition of lynda.com. We believe this could be one of LinkedIn’s most transformational initiatives as it has the potential to improve the member experience across the platform. lynda.com now has more than 6,800 total courses and 280,000 videos across five languages. The content team has continued to launch new features, and is adding more than 150 courses per month. We have already tested early integration efforts, and the results so far have exceeded our expectations. One promotional campaign delivered to LinkedIn members outperformed our expectations by 7x in generating new subscribers, an early signal of what we can achieve when applying LinkedIn’s scale, data and distribution to lynda.com’s content. Lastly, helping members get hired is quickly emerging as one of the fastest growing areas of engagement on LinkedIn. Unique visitors to jobs-related pages continue to materially accelerate, up 40% year over year in June, compared to approximately 10% in January. This growth has been driven by two factors. First, we continue to increase the scale of jobs on LinkedIn, with approximately 4 million active job listings today, compared to roughly 1 million a year ago. Second, we have built a much improved experience for job seekers. Our revamped Job Search app now has 3 million activations, up from approximately 1 million during the first quarter. Creating value for our members enables us to transform the way our customers Hire, Market, and Sell on a global basis through our three diverse product lines. In Q2, Talent Solutions grew 38% to $443 million, inclusive of learning and development revenue from lynda.com; Marketing Solutions was up 32% to $140 million; and Premium Subscriptions, which includes Sales Solutions, increased 22% to $128 million. For Talent Solutions, Q2 saw solid progress against our broader efforts to position the business for long-term success. As we discussed on our last call, Q1 was a period of operational transition as we re-segmented a significant portion of our sales force. We are pleased with how the sales force executed last quarter, demonstrated by deeper customer relationships and an improvement in churn year over year. In addition, our customers will benefit from our increased investment in R&D in 2015, as we roll out significant improvements and new products at our annual Talent Connect conference in October. For Marketing Solutions, we continue to create a more scalable business and become the most effective platform for marketers to engage professionals. Sponsored Updates had a strong Q2, more than doubling year over year. This offering now accounts for nearly 50% of all Marketing Solutions revenue. LinkedIn Lead Accelerator, launched in February, is seeing good initial demand. Going forward, the team is prioritizing simplifying the product and fine-tuning the go-to-market strategy. In Sales Solutions, for the past several months the R&D team has focused on iterating our flagship Sales Navigator product, while the field sales team continues to educate the market about the benefits of social selling. During the quarter, we saw dramatic improvements in Sales Navigator customer satisfaction, as measured through NPS. Also, while early in the quarter, we have seen customers renewing at higher than expected levels despite higher Sales Navigator prices following last year’s flagship launch. Lastly, LinkedIn @ Work, our newest value proposition, is off to a good start. The recently launched Elevate helps employees curate and share high quality content with their networks. Members using Elevate are sharing content at a 3x higher rate than before, and as a result, employers are seeing higher engagement with company pages and job views. Blue chip companies including Unilever, AXA, and Visa are among pilot customers building a deeper relationship with LinkedIn through Elevate, and we are excited to build on these initial contracts. Finally, a word about our Talent, our number one operating priority as a company. Summer kicked off intern season at LinkedIn, and this year we have nearly 350 interns across our global offices, up from 70 just four years ago. Our world class internship program has emerged as an important pipeline for hiring world class talent, and a very high percentage of our interns convert into full-time employees. More broadly, recruiting for technical and other talent remains one of our core strengths. And now, I’ll turn it over to Steve for a deeper dive into our operating metrics and financials. Prepared Remarks — Steve Sordello, CFO LinkedIn Corporation Today I will discuss growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless indicated otherwise, and non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, and the tax impacts of these adjustments. During the second quarter, LinkedIn demonstrated solid performance as we made progress on several long-term strategic initiatives including improving our flagship member experience, making progress on Talent Solutions salesforce re-segmentation, and closing the lynda.com acquisition. With respect to members, we continued to see positive trends supported by building momentum in our three value propositions. Unique visiting members grew 16%, outpaced by member page view growth of 37%. This resulted in an 18% year-over-year increase in page views-per-unique visitor, our highest rate of increase since early 2013. In the quarter, we generated $712 million in sales, an increase of 33 percent year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, growth would have been 38 percent. Q2 results included contribution from lynda of $18 million in revenue. Within Talent Solutions, Learning & Development is now reported as a separate product category along with our core Hiring products. Overall, Talent Solutions showed strong performance, with revenue of $443 million growing 38% year-over-year, representing 62% of sales versus 60% last year. Within Hiring, revenue grew 32% year-over-year. The business exhibited operational improvement as we leveraged our new customer segments that rolled out during the first quarter. As a reminder, after a 2014 pilot, we proactively re-segmented enterprise customers during Q1 to better align reps with customer needs. Positive momentum from the customer segment changes built throughout the quarter, leading to a year-over-year increase in our net ratio, which measures add-ons and renewals net of churn. Churn also decreased on both a year-on-year and sequential basis, an encouraging sign with respect to customer success. Given the ratable nature of the business, improvement should build gradually throughout the year. And finally, we continued to see strength in acquiring new customers, ending with over 37,000 total accounts. Our online channel is where small companies turn to LinkedIn on a self-serve basis, and in Q2 we began to achieve more stable growth. Job Seeker and Recruiter Lite subscriptions showed strength, powered by the broader changes we’ve made to the premium subscription platform. Learning & Development contributed $18 million after the mid-May close of lynda. We are increasingly encouraged by lynda’s long-term potential as we gain greater familiarity with lynda’s core assets. In addition to the consumer oriented campaigns Jeff mentioned, the nascent enterprise business has already exceeded early expectations. Marketing Solutions grew 32% to $140 million, representing a similar 20% of sales as last year. Sponsored Updates remained strong during the quarter, now contributing approximately 45 percent of overall Marketing Solutions. 80% of Sponsored Updates now comes from mobile, benefitting from faster overall mobile engagement growth and a product that creates a high quality member experience. Growth exceeded 100% year-over-year, due to a combination of positive auction-based pricing dynamics and greater demand. Weakness in CPM-based premium display sold by our salesforce somewhat offset Sponsored Updates strength. Display revenue continued to decline, decreasing approximately 30% year-over-year versus a 10% decline in the first quarter. Our investment continues to move away from display and towards product areas that best leverage our unique data assets to maximize member experience and customer ROI. As a result, we continue to shift our portfolio towards native content marketing and lead generation. To that end, we continue to evolve our recently launched Lead Accelerator product. Demand is strong and has exceeded our initial customer acquisition expectations although utilization has been varied. With Lead Accelerator we are bringing a completely new value proposition to market requiring quick product iteration and a streamlining of the customer experience. In that vein, we will shift to primarily focus on annual subscriptions where we’ve substantially higher renewal rates vs. shorter-term contracts. We expect this focus to increase long-term customer success. Premium Subscriptions grew 22% to $128 million, contributing 18% of revenue versus 20% last year. Consistent with past quarters, our general subscription product supplied the majority of premium revenue. Our strategy remains focused on aligning paying members with a product that best fits their needs from a simplified set of SKUs. In addition, Premium Subscriptions increasingly acts as a platform to identify opportunities that can drive increased member value. This first occurred with Recruiter to serve talent acquisition professionals, then with Sales Navigator for salespeople, and more recently with job seekers as we’ve come to better understand the value of using LinkedIn to get hired. While we have new initiatives in flight within Premium Subscriptions, our belief is that this line becomes smaller as a % of revenue over time as successful initiatives move into other revenue lines. With respect to Sales Solutions, revenue continued to grow significantly faster than overall premium subscriptions. We are encouraged by the quickly improving core product experience as represented by a large increase in NPS scores. Importantly, business generated from field sales exceeded business generated from self-serve for the first time in Q2. And lastly, though still early, data from the second half is encouraging with respect to grandfathered customers renewing at a higher price point versus when the flagship product launched last year. In terms of geography, the impact from currency and continued weakness in EMEA Marketing Solutions resulted in a decline in the percentage of revenue generated outside the US, from 40% last year to 38% in the second quarter. With respect to channel, field sales drove 62% of revenue compared with 60% last year. Moving to the non-GAAP financials, Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, a 23% margin. This performance was better than our original expectation, driven by core business out-performance along with an earlier than anticipated close of the lynda acquisition. Excluding the impact of lynda, our standalone margin would have been 26%, a 3% difference. Depreciation and Amortization totaled $99 million while stock compensation was $145 million. The lynda acquisition accounted for a one-time $22 million impact on stock compensation. On taxes, we recorded a GAAP benefit of $26 million , and we continue to have a 23% non-GAAP rate. GAAP net loss was $68 million, resulting in a 53 cent loss per share, compared to a loss of $1 million and 1 cent loss last year. Approximately $31 million of GAAP pre-tax expense was related to one-time lynda costs. Non-GAAP net income was $71 million, resulting in earnings of 55 cents per share, compared with $63 million and 51 cents last year. The balance sheet remains well positioned with $3.0 billion of cash and marketable securities. Operating cash flow was $226 million versus $128 million a year ago, and free cash flow was $153 million, up from $32 million last year. I will end the call with guidance for the third quarter and an updated outlook for 2015. For the third quarter: • We expect revenue between $745 and $750 million, 32 percent growth at the midpoint. • We expect Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $146 - 148 million, a 20% margin. • For non-GAAP EPS, we expect approximately 43 cents per share. For the full year: • We expect revenue of approximately $2.94 billion, 33% year-over-year growth. • We expect Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $665 million, a 23% margin. • For non-GAAP EPS, we expect approximately $2.19 per share. Relative to guidance, I want to provide additional color on current trends in our business: • In Talent Solutions, we are encouraged by improving execution from the first quarter’s customer re-segmentation as well as changes in our online jobs and subs products. In addition, we are excited about a robust product pipeline that will add major improvements to our core products for the first time in several years. • In Marketing Solutions, three dynamics are at play. First, Sponsored Updates remains strong and will soon become the majority of our business, powered in particular by the shift to mobile. Second, premium display continues to face headwinds in light of deteriorating secular trends. And third, with Lead Accelerator, we are taking a more focused approach in the second half, and believe this focus will maximize long-term success. • In Sales Solutions, the improving customer experience sets a good foundation for upcoming product enhancements and our annual Sales Connect customer event. Specific to lynda: • As we said last quarter, we will focus the rest of 2015 on consumer and enterprise pilots to better inform our longer-term approach. In 2016, we plan to implement wider scale integration across both our consumer platform and enterprise go-to-market. • We now expect approximately $90 million of contribution for the full year versus original guidance for approximately $40 million - impacted by an earlier than expected close, a lower than anticipated deferred revenue writedown, and moderate over-performance in the early-going. • With respect to Adjusted EBITDA margin, we expect lynda to have a 4% downward impact for Q3 and 3% for the full year versus LinkedIn as a standalone business. Including lynda, additional guidance incorporates: • Depreciation of approximately $69 million for Q3 and $278 million for the full year, with third quarter amortization of approximately $47 million and $135 million for the full year. • Stock based compensation of approximately $128 million for Q3 and $510 million for the full year. • Other expense of approximately $16 million for Q3 and $60 million for the full year, including GAAP-only convertible accretion of $12 million in Q3 and $47 million for the full year. • A Non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for Q3 and the full year. And for share count: • On a GAAP basis, we expect 131 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q3, and average of 129 million for the full year. • On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 133 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q3 and an average of 131 million for the full year. In closing, we are pleased with our execution this quarter. Members continue to increase engagement in our core product experience, setting us up well for much larger innovation across the product portfolio. With respect to revenue, we made good progress in what was a transitional quarter within Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and the early integration of lynda. Each of these initiatives represents an important step in realizing our multi-year strategy, and we will continue to invest in creating value for both members and customers.

About LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the ways companies hire, market and sell. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph. LinkedIn has approximately 380 million members and has offices around the world. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 23% has been applied to its non-GAAP financial results for the current period. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net loss or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net loss are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net loss is not available without unreasonable effort.

The announcement was made at our new regional headquarters in Dubai, and keynoted by Her Excellency Noura Al Kaabi, Chief Executive Officer of the Media Zone Authority - Abu Dhabi. Speaking at the event, HE Noura Al Kaabi, “The launch of LinkedIn Arabic is a significant step towards strengthening the Arabic media sector, developing local content and nurturing Arabic talent. LinkedIn Arabic will enable greater communication among individuals and major companies within the region and support career building efforts with the ability to search for opportunities that fit with their skills and potential. “Arabic is spoken by over 300 million of the global population, more than French and Portuguese, yet it is underrepresented on the Internet. As speakers of this great language, it is our duty to be proactive, collaborate and strengthen the content available online in our language, and to initiate new sites and platforms, such as LinkedIn Arabic, that will cater for Arab youth and the generations to come. I commend those driving the development of LinkedIn’s Arabic initiative and wish them every success in developing this socially-significant, Arabic-led tool,” she added. The launch of Arabic - the first bi-directional language on LinkedIn - brings the total number of languages available to 24. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a fast growing region for LinkedIn, growing from five million members in October 2012 when the company opened their local office in Dubai, to more than 14 million today. “We already have more than 14 million members here in the MENA region using LinkedIn in English. The launch of an Arabic version will provide a more relevant experience to our members and customers in the region,” said Ali Matar, Head of LinkedIn MENA Talent Solutions. “This will open up opportunities for hundreds of millions of Arabic speaking professionals to connect and engage with other professionals and employers across the world, and for companies to find and attract the best talent, connect their brand with our audience, and engage with their customers,” continued Matar.

About LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the ways companies hire, market and sell. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph. LinkedIn has more than 300 million members and has offices around the world. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Non-cash interest expense related to convertible senior notes. In November 2014, the company issued $1,323 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the company separately accounted for the value of the conversion feature as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects the company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, the company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 4.7% in its statement of operations. The company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and coupon interest expense, net of any capitalized interest, because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a static non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected 10-year weighted average non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect the company's long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on the company's current forecast, a tax rate of 25% will be applied to its non-GAAP financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2015. This rate will be adjusted annually, if necessary. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from its non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Trended Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net income (loss) or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort.

Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect our long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on our current forecast, a non-GAAP tax rate of 35% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results for the current period. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net income (loss) or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort.

About LinkedIn Founded in 2003, LinkedIn connects the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful. With over 300 million members worldwide, including executives from every Fortune 500 company, LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the Internet. The company has a diversified business model with revenue coming from Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions and Premium Subscriptions products. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, LinkedIn has offices across the globe. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effects and adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by considering the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect our long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on our current forecast, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 35% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results for the current period. The company believes that adjusting for these income tax effects and adjustments provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During periods with a net loss, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP EPS guidance to net income (loss) or GAAP EPS guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or GAAP provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort.

About LinkedIn Founded in 2003, LinkedIn connects the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful. With over 300 million members worldwide, including executives from every Fortune 500 company, LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the Internet. The company has a diversified business model with revenue coming from Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions and Premium Subscriptions products. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, LinkedIn has offices across the globe. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to peer operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest. The accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the accretion of the company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value. The company excludes the accretion because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance. In addition, excluding this item from the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peer operating results. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by including the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, the company has implemented a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating its operating performance as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. This projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and does not necessarily reflect our long-term operations. Historically, the company computed a non-GAAP tax rate based on non-GAAP pre-tax income on a quarterly basis. Based on our current forecast, a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 35% has been applied to our non-GAAP financial results for the first quarter of 2014. The company believes that the inclusion of the income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During the first quarter of 2014, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income (loss) guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort.

The company also announced today that its Norwegian members are some of the most engaged in the world for LinkedIn. Norway is the latest of the Nordic markets to pass the milestone, following Sweden and Denmark. “One million Norwegian members is an important milestone for us, illustrating that Norwegian professionals really understand the potential of LinkedIn to network, showcase their experience and seek out job opportunities. Our data also shows that our Norwegian members are one of the most engaged audiences in the world for LinkedIn. They’re adding new information to their profiles, share knowledge, build their network and get access to a world of potential connections, business partners, investors, employers and employees,” explains Lars Ingerslev, Head of Talent Solutions, LinkedIn Nordics. Norwegians are amongst the most active and engaged LinkedIn members in all of Europe, as well as having some of the most avid social networkers across the region; almost 1 in 4 Norwegians members visit their LinkedIn profile weekly or daily. 16 percent of the Norwegian users also say they think they will use LinkedIn even more the next six months. Norway’s ‘mobile moment’ Norway is also ranked as one of the top 10 countries with highest mobile usage of LinkedIn, with more than 50 percent of members now accessing the site purely using mobile. This uptake in mobile has been driven in part by product innovations such as the LinkedIn iPad app, enabling professionals to stay connected and up to speed with the latest industry trends wherever they may be working. LinkedIn’s Norwegian membership data released to celebrate the announcement paints an interesting picture of the professional make-up of the country: The biggest sector in terms of employment is Oil & Energy industry; The biggest employer of LinkedIn members in Norway is the Statoil; More Norwegian LinkedIn members were educated in Handelshøyskolen BI than any other university in Norway. 1 Million Norwegian Members – The Fast Facts The following section outlines the top three most popular entries across a range of categories based on LinkedIn’s Norwegian membership.

Nine countries in the region now have over 1 million members - India (24+ million), Australia (5+ million), China (4+ million), Indonesia and the Philippines (2+ million each), Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and New Zealand (1+ million each). This 50-million member milestone represents nearly a tripling of LinkedIn’s member base in the region from May 2011, when it opened its regional centre in Singapore. In 2013, LinkedIn welcomed more than 7 million new members in India, while 2 million joined the network in Australia and New Zealand. In Southeast Asia, the number of members jumped more than 50 percent to exceed 9 million. “The strong growth we are seeing in our member base is a great encouragement for us. We still have much to do in terms of connecting all professionals around the world. Accordingly, we are looking to introduce more features to deliver even more value to our members and customers,” commented Hari Krishnan, MD of LinkedIn Asia Pacific and Japan. Since 2011, LinkedIn has also added six Asian languages to its offerings to offer a more localised experience for members in these markets. It also introduced several Asia-based influencers to enrich the professional knowledge on its platform, including top executives such as Tony Fernandes (Group CEO, AirAsia), David Thodey (CEO & Executive Director, Telstra), Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (Chairman & Managing Director, Biocon) and Nobuyuki Idei (Founder & CEO, Quantum Leaps, and Former Chairman & CEO, Sony). As its member base continues to grow, LinkedIn was also able to help clients across the region reach out and engage with a broader audience. These clients include Standard Chartered Bank, AirAsia, SingPost, Lenovo, University of Queensland and Van Heusen. “Asia is a growth story. As the region increasingly consolidates its position as a key driver of the global economy, our aim is to help professionals and businesses in Asia become even more successful at what they do. Whether it’s expanding professional connections, tapping critical talent or marketing and selling to this influential audience, we’re excited to be able to help connect the dots and create economic opportunities for everyone,” Mr. Krishnan continued. Some facts about LinkedIn’s 50 million members in Asia Pacific: While the top 5 companies followed by members across the region are mainly global multinationals in the tech sector, many “home-grown” companies or those with a significant market presence also have strong local followings.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to competitors' operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by including the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company believes that the inclusion of the income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income is not available without unreasonable effort. Safe Harbor Statement “Safe Harbor” statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This press release and the accompanying conference call contain forward-looking statements about our products, including our investments in products, technology and other key strategic areas, certain non-financial metrics, such as member growth and engagement, and our expected financial metrics such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2014 and the full fiscal year 2014.

About LinkedIn Founded in 2003, LinkedIn connects the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful. With more than 259 million members worldwide, including executives from every Fortune 500 company, LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the Internet. The company has a diversified business model with revenue coming from Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions and Premium Subscriptions products. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, LinkedIn has offices across the globe. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to competitors' operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by including the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company believes that the inclusion of the income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. Dilutive shares under the treasury stock method. During the third quarter of 2013, the company excluded certain potential common shares from its GAAP diluted shares because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. On a non-GAAP basis, these shares would have been dilutive. As a result, the company has included the impact of these shares in the calculation of its non-GAAP diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income (loss) guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort.

That is our core value. Our success is based on the trust that our members place in us. We strive in all our actions to earn their trust by ensuring our policies, procedures and practices provide the clarity, consistency and control that our members have come to expect from us. We do all of this with a fundamental commitment to transparency. To that end, today we are pleased to be releasing our most recent Transparency Report for the first half of 2013. This report discloses information regarding government requests from around the world for member data we received from January 1 through June 30 of this year and our responses to those requests. As you will see, the report discloses the number of various types of government requests but unfortunately excludes requests related to U.S. national security-related matters. The reason for this exclusion is simple: we have been expressly prohibited by the U.S. government from disclosing the number of U.S. national security-related requests we receive, if any. This prohibition, which limits our ability to provide the transparency that we think our members and the public deserve, has been the source of great disappointment and frustration to us. LinkedIn has long sought to increase transparency about government requests for our members’ data, which has become particularly important in light of recent revelations about the extensive nature of U.S. government surveillance. We also have engaged with policy makers to improve the framework for protecting members’ data, taking action on many fronts. For example, through our efforts as part of the Digital Due Process Coalition, we continue to promote changes to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, an outdated patchwork of confusing standards for allowing law enforcement access to personal information held by technology companies. As a matter of principle, we think it is critical that the U.S. government - while preserving the tools it needs to protect the public - promote and enact laws that protect privacy and take into account changes in technology and user patterns. LinkedIn strongly believes that all data, whether analog or digital, whether stored on personal computers or in the cloud, is subject to full U.S. Constitution Fourth Amendment protection, no less than documents stored in a file cabinet or in a desk drawer. By way of example, if the U.S. government wants to access a rolodex of contacts located in physical form on an individual’s desk without notice to the person, that can be obtained only via a search warrant, which requires the government to demonstrate “probable cause.” But when that same rolodex of contacts is stored electronically in the cloud (for instance, your LinkedIn connections), current statutes provide that the U.S. government can access that data without notice to the individual via a subpoena to LinkedIn, which requires the government to show only that the data sought is “relevant” to its investigation, a much lower standard than probable cause. It makes no sense that the technological advancement of our society should reduce the protections offered under the Fourth Amendment. Based on this constitutional principle, we require the government to use the higher standard and obtain a search warrant for access to a member’s connections. We scrutinize and evaluate every request for member data. Consistent with our commitment to our members, we provide only data that we believe we are legally required to provide or under emergency circumstances. We also take steps to notify the member whose data is being requested prior to providing the data, whether the requestor is the government or a private party, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so or the request is an emergency. It was against that background, and consistent with our history of proactive engagement and cooperation with law enforcement and other regulatory agencies in both the U.S. and abroad, that we engaged in active discussions with the U.S. government, and did so for months, including at the highest levels of the FBI. Despite our outreach and efforts to work cooperatively, we were recently told by the U.S. government that, notwithstanding our commitment to transparency, we were prohibited from providing our members and the general public with even basic, aggregate information regarding the numbers of national security-related requests, if any. We decided we owed it to our members, the internet industry and the general public to take action. As reflected in a letter to the Director and General Counsel of the FBI we sent today, we have been unable to convince the U.S. government that their requirements are not legally warranted and make no sense, especially as applied to a company like LinkedIn. In our discussions, the U.S. government ultimately gave us two choices: We can report the total number of all non-security-related U.S. government requests and can separately report the total number of national security letters received, if any, but only within a bucket range of 0 to 1000 annually (even if we issue our Transparency Reports twice a year), and without any reporting regarding the requests we receive, if any, under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); or We can report in a single bucket of 0 to 1000 every six months all U.S. government requests, including national security letters and FISA requests, if any, but cannot break the bucket down into specific numbers, percentages or otherwise. Both alternatives, for a company like LinkedIn with relatively low numbers of requests for member data in general, are nonsensical, as they would seriously distort the information provided to our members and the public and, of course, would reduce rather than enhance transparency. For example, if we received 100 non-security related requests and 10 national security letters in a year, we could report only the 100 requests and then state that the number of national security letters was between 0 and 1000. We believe that this type of reporting defeats transparency, and in fact, would be misleading about the number of users affected by government requests, and could generate unwarranted concern by members and the general public, both in the United States and abroad. Make no mistake, we deeply respect and support the U.S. government’s strong interest in, and its obligation to protect, national security. However, this interest must be weighed against transparency and accountability. The bottom line is that we firmly believe that what we are seeking – the disclosure of the number of U.S. national security-related requests that we receive – is consistent with national security interests, the law and our commitment to transparency. As a result, and given our inability to reach agreement with U.S. government representatives despite our best efforts, we are left with no choice but to file a legal challenge to the U.S. government’s position. Today we are filing a petition in the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seeking the ability to publish the specific number of national security-related requests we receive (if any) under each of the various provisions of FISA. In addition, we are asking that the Court hold its hearing on our petition in public, rather than in secret as is its normal practice. Our petition echoes requests made to Congress and the President by industry members and public interest organizations earlier this year. We are also filing today an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit urging affirmance of the district court’s ruling in the case of “In Re National Security Letter”, No. 11-02173 SI (N.D. Cal.), which held that national security letter disclosure restrictions (aka “gag orders”) violate the First Amendment and, in particular, that the prohibition on disclosure of the number of such letters received is not required by national security interests. If the Ninth Circuit affirms the district court’s opinion, then we anticipate we will be allowed to include in our Transparency Report the actual number of national security letters we receive, if any, rather than having to do so in buckets of 1000. We don’t take such important steps lightly, but these are issues we firmly believe in. As a matter of principle, we think it is imperative that the U.S. government – while retaining the tools needed to protect national security – (a) interpret and apply the law in a manner that respects and protects individuals’ privacy, (b) take into account technological evolution, and (c) balance the need for national security with the critically important values of trust and transparency. That would be good for our members, good for business, and good for the Internet. We further believe that greater transparency on these issues will help foster and inform the ongoing and vitally important public debate surrounding the U.S. government’s security programs. We plan to continue to advocate for these principles in every appropriate venue so that we can deliver on our commitment to transparency, and continue to earn our members’ trust. With Respect, Erika Rottenberg Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary"},{"platform":"LinkedIn","url":"https://news.linkedin.com/2013/09/al-futtaim-chooses-linkedin-to-transform-talent-acquisition-and-engagement","date":"2013-09-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["EMEA"],"title":"Al-Futtaim Chooses LinkedIn to Transform Talent Acquisition and Engagement","text":"Dubai, UAE – September 17, 2013 – LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network with more than 238 million members worldwide and over nine million professionals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and Al-Futtaim, one of the region’s largest trading businesses, today announced that Al-Futtaim will use LinkedIn Talent Solutions to support the company’s growth and build its employer brand in the region. Al-Futtaim employs in excess of 40,000 people and operates through more than 100 companies. The group has significantly expanded its business operations in recent years through a strategic acquisition plan and has entered a number of new territories, increasing its footprint beyond the GCC and Greater Middle East to encompass South East and North Asia, Australasia and Europe. Through LinkedIn’s Talent Solutions’ platform, Al-Futtaim will transform the way it drives brand awareness and acquires top talent. This includes using its LinkedIn Career Page to tell a rich story about the business with images, video, employee testimonials and more. Al-Futtaim will also use LinkedIn’s flagship product, Recruiter, which allows companies to recruit the best passive candidates, (those not actively looking for work) with unparalleled search and collaboration tools. “At Al-Futtaim, as we evaluate our future growth opportunities and ways we reinforce our leadership, it is important that we are able to grow our reputation and position ourselves as employer of choice. LinkedIn enables us to discover the best talent from across the world and locally, in addition to strengthening our employer brand,” said John Harker, Group Director, Human Resources & Marketing, Al-Futtaim. According to LinkedIn data, a strong employer brand reduces cost per hire by up to 50 per cent. Eighty three per cent of global recruiting leaders surveyed in LinkedIn’s Global Recruiting Trends Report 2013, say employer branding is a critical driver of their ability to hire top talent[1]. LinkedIn’s career pages allow businesses to differentiate their business and engage with talent through video, banners and employee spotlights.

LinkedIn encourages professionals to invite their parents into their workplace to provide them with a first-hand look and greater understanding of what they actually do every day. Parents can be a valuable part of a professional’s network, having faced challenges and important career lessons along the way. However, one in three parents admit they are unfamiliar with what their child does for a living and so may find it challenging to provide the right advice to support their child's success. LinkedIn Bring in Your Parents Day is a way to help bridge this gap by bringing parents and their children together in the workplace, so they can learn from each other. “Given all of the new types of jobs created over the past few years, it’s understandable that a lot of parents may not understand what their kids actually do at work each day,” said Pat Wadors, vice president of talent at LinkedIn. “We created LinkedIn Bring In Your Parents Day so that professionals worldwide can provide their parents a glimpse into what they do at work, and in return, learn valuable lessons and even greater admiration from their parents.” In a recent global survey, LinkedIn found that two thirds of parents want to learn more about what their child does, and half of the surveyed parents feel it could be beneficial to their child’s career development if they had a better understanding of the child’s job. Careers such as social media manager, investment banker and sociologist are among the top 10 professions that parents are least likely to comprehend. The top 10 misunderstood jobs globally, with the percentage of parents who weren’t confident in their ability to describe the job are: 1. User Interface Designer (74 percent) 2. Actuary (72 percent) 3. Data Scientist (62 percent) 4. Social Media Manager (61 percent) 5. Sub Editor (59 percent) 6. Sociologist (52 percent) 7. Radio Producer (51 percent) 8. Public Relations Manager (50 percent) 9. Sports Team Manager (43 percent) 10. Investment Banker (43 percent) LinkedIn Bring In Your Parents Day will be held in 14 countries including the United Kingdom, United States, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Australia, India, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong, and encourages business worldwide to take part in the day.

The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to competitors' operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by including the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company believes that the inclusion of the income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or “after tax” effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income is not available without unreasonable effort.

Globally, the site attracts more than two new members every second, and has more than 200 million members worldwide. With this milestone, LinkedIn is now home to about 70% of the country’s professional labor force and student population[i]. The Singapore market is also the fourth in Southeast Asia that surpassed the 1-millon member mark on LinkedIn, after Malaysia (1+ million), Indonesia and The Philippines (both 1.5+ million each). Other markets in Asia Pacific with more than a million members include Australia (4+ million), India (19+ million) and China (3+ million). LinkedIn’s Singapore office serves as the company’s Asia-Pacific headquarters, acting as a nexus for LinkedIn’s regional sales and marketing, member engagement, and strategic regional partnerships. In the past two years, in addition to doubling its membership in Singapore; LinkedIn’s staff count has increased more than tenfold to over 90 employees, reflecting the importance of Singapore as a regional hub supporting the company’s nine other Asia-Pacific offices. “This milestone is particularly significant for us at LinkedIn because it means that over one million members in Singapore are seeing the value that LinkedIn is adding to their professional lives,” said Hari Krishnan, Managing Director for Asia-Pacific and Japan, LinkedIn. “Singapore is increasingly becoming a regional hub for key industry sectors such as financial services, infocomm and media; as a result, skills, innovation, and productivity improvements are the fundamental pillars for success and economic growth. We see LinkedIn playing a key role in enabling that. Our members are using the network to gain the knowledge and insights they need to do their jobs better every day, through features such as the ability to follow influential global thought leaders and LinkedIn Today, which aggregates news relevant to your industry and network.” Alongside LinkedIn’s growing penetration of professionals in Singapore, there has been an accompanying demand amongst companies here for LinkedIn’s suite of services, including talent, marketing and sales solutions. The company now has a wide cross-section of clients using LinkedIn, including SingPost, Banyan Tree Hotels & Resorts and IBM. “We see the 1 million member milestone in Singapore as a key tipping point. All the member interactions taking place on LinkedIn form a massive wealth of data; which companies are using to transform the way they hire the right talent, market their brands to the right audience, and sell more effectively,” Krishnan added. Leading C-suite professionals, senior executives and entrepreneurs in Singapore are also leveraging LinkedIn to boost their professional brand.

Over the past three years, Pulse has established itself as a key part of that conversation; it has grown from a small project, to a platform for millions of readers to access their favorite content,” said Kothari.

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to competitors' operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. The company adjusts non-GAAP net income by including the income tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company believes that the inclusion of the income tax effects provides additional transparency to the overall or \"after tax\" effects of excluding these items from non-GAAP net income. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income guidance because it does not provide guidance for either other income (expense), net, or provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income are out of the company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income is not available without unreasonable effort.

The one million member milestone is significant following the launch of the Bahasa Malaysia language site in 2011. The launch of the Bahasa Malaysia language site has spurred a whole new generation of LinkedIn users locally. Professionals in Malaysia are building their professional profile, connecting with a global network, gaining relevant business insights and seeking out their dream jobs. “This is an important milestone illustrating that Malaysians really understand the economic opportunity that lies behind online professional networking,” explained Clifford Rosenberg, Managing Director Australia, New Zealand & Southeast Asia at LinkedIn. “As our membership continues to grow, LinkedIn has become an avenue for Malaysian professionals to establish their online brand, gain insights, as well as find new business or career opportunities,” he added. Malaysia is facing a heightened challenge for top talent, due to a limited talent pool and a Gen Y attracted by opportunities to work in other South East Asian countries[1]. With new members signing up at a rate that is faster than two new members per second globally, LinkedIn’s global reach and scale can help professionals and companies in Malaysia connect opportunity with talent through its large, global network of resources and opportunities. As part of Malaysia’s national goal of tackling Vision 2020 aspirations, companies are moving towards new ways to create a competitive, robust, and resilient economy. LinkedIn’s recently launched Talent Brand Index can benefit Malaysian employers to measure and benchmark the strength of their employer brand and improve their ability to attract top talent. LinkedIn has seen strong demand and response from companies such as AirAsia, Axiata and MayBank leveraging LinkedIn Talent Solutions to take a more strategic approach to recruitment and retention. “Axiata stands to benefit from the growth of LinkedIn members in Malaysia as it allows us to engage with highly skilled professionals in the telecommunications industry. We constantly source senior talent for our operations in various countries from the Asian region as well as globally to keep up with the rapid change in the demands of the industry,” said Darke M Sani, Group Chief Human Resources Officer for Axiata Group Berhad. Companies such as Malaysia Airlines are also realizing the benefits of LinkedIn Marketing Solutions, as online social networks are now the new norm for Malaysians. According to a recent Comscore Report, social networking accounts for one third of all time spent online in Malaysia.[2] This is where LinkedIn advertisements in Bahasa Malaysia can benefit local marketers, making it easier for members and businesses to share information and create messages that better resonate with their target audience, delivering more compelling and locally-relevant opportunities.

About LinkedIn Founded in 2003, LinkedIn connects the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful. With more than 150 million members worldwide, including executives from every Fortune 500 company, LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the Internet. The company has a diversified business model with revenue coming from member subscriptions, marketing solutions and hiring solutions. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, LinkedIn has offices across the globe. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP EPS (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation. The company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. The company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements and facilitates comparisons to competitors’ operating results. Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Excluding the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision related to those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. Assumed preferred stock conversion. As a result of the company’s initial public offering, all outstanding shares of preferred stock were automatically converted into shares of Class B common stock. Consequently, non-GAAP diluted net income per share has been calculated assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into shares of Class B common stock. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures” table in this press release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Additionally, the company has not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income guidance because it does not provide guidance for other income (expense) and provision for income taxes, which are reconciling items between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA. As items that impact net income (loss) are out of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the company is unable to provide such guidance. Accordingly, a reconciliation to net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort.

LinkedIn’s Company Pages can be created and managed in Japanese and with its new “status update” feature, companies now have the ability to have a direct dialogue with their followers to post updates on company news, new jobs, relevant industry articles, videos and more. More than 60 Japanese companies have already created a Company Page on LinkedIn. Features for Students and New Professionals Millions of students today are using LinkedIn around the world to build their professional identity and network, to help achieve their career goals by connecting with established professionals who can provide insights into relevant internship, job or business opportunities. Students can connect to fellow students to learn more about where they’ve landed jobs, reach out to alumni for advice and counsel, and leverage the networks of their parents, family, friends or mentors to get a head start on their career planning. Students can also gather important information about companies and industries using products like Groups, Signal and Company Pages to glean important information that can help them make better decisions about their career choices.

The announcement was made onstage by LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner in front of more than 1,800 recruiting professionals at the company’s Talent Connect customer event in Las Vegas, Nevada. With the rise of social media, recruiters are dealing with an increase in online networks as sources of talent who may not be actively seeking a new job. This is in addition to more traditional sources such as personal referrals, conferences, job boards and company career sites. This shift toward recruiting ‘passive’ talent gives recruiters access to a much larger pool of potential candidates with the right skills and experience than if they relied on active candidates alone. Talent Pipeline will allow recruiters to keep track of all of these potential candidates in one place, even before they enter the formal application process. Speaking on the announcement, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner commented, “Recruiters are actively looking for more talent from more sources and managing all their talent leads across multiple tools. With LinkedIn Talent Pipeline, we’re extending our Recruiter platform and continuing our focus to connect talent with opportunity on a massive scale by providing a single place to manage and update these leads, wherever they are found.” Because most passive candidates have not formally applied for a job, they are not tracked in a company’s Applicant Tracking System (ATS). As a result, many recruiters are simply tracking leads in their own spreadsheets - a tool designed for crunching numbers, not tracking, nurturing and collaborating on recruitment. James Holincheck, Managing Vice President of Human Capital Management at Gartner commented, “One of the most frequent things we hear from enterprises today is a desire to better manage the increasing number of talent sources. Recruiters know that passive candidates are an important source of talent and want better tools to capture this opportunity.” Today, companies that try to create a separate database for leads spend significant time and effort to implement a new system and process, only to find they haven’t solved the problem of stale information. The moment someone changes a title, job or location, the original lead or resume is out-of-date and the database becomes less valuable. LinkedIn Talent Pipeline solves this problem: All of their talent leads, at their fingertips, on the LinkedIn Recruiter platform. Recruiters can import leads and resumes found from other sources into Recruiter. These records can be searched, tagged with additional information, and shared across the team just like any profile sourced on LinkedIn. With new tools for adding a lead’s source and status, recruiters will be able to report on and improve the efficiency of their pipeline activities. Stale leads are transformed into up-to-date records with deeper insights by being connected to LinkedIn. When new leads are imported, they are connected to their LinkedIn profile, which members keep updating even when they aren’t looking for a job. Recruiters are better positioned to evaluate and build relationships with leads, based on the insights provided by the LinkedIn profile, including shared connections, activity updates, recommendations and shared groups. Because it is LinkedIn, it is an easy extension of the sourcing that recruiting teams already do on the professional network today. More than 75 of the Fortune 100 and another 6,000 companies use LinkedIn Hiring Solutions as a resource for finding, contacting, evaluating and staying in touch with leads, since they know most of their leads have profiles on LinkedIn. LinkedIn is working closely with a number of large recruiters to develop Talent Pipeline, including PepsiCo, Pfizer, Red Hat, First Citizens Bank and Netflix, L.J. Brock, Vice President of Global Talent Acquisition & Infrastructure at Red Hat, the world’s leading open source technology provider, commented, “Our talent acquisition strategy is based on building refined talent pools for the strategic roles essential to our business. Maintaining meaningful relationships with these candidates in a personalized but scalable manner is a priority for us. LinkedIn Talent Pipeline will allow us to do that more effectively than anything that exists today.” Available in the first half of 2012, the core functionality of Talent Pipeline will be included as part of LinkedIn Recruiter at no additional charge. A separate version of Talent Pipeline will be available for team members not using Recruiter.

When hiring managers or business partners are comparing two people side by side, volunteer experience makes you a more multifaceted professional and can set you apart from the competition.” To add the “Volunteer Experience & Causes” field to your LinkedIn Profile: After logging in, click “Profile” at the top of LinkedIn. Click the “Add Sections” hyperlink. Select “Volunteer Experience & Causes.” Click the “Add to Profile” button and then fill out the applicable fields.

LinkedIn saw a 200% increase in sign-ups following the launch of the French platform in November 2008, bringing the total number of French-speaking users past 700,000. The Spanish platform, launched in July 2008, helped LinkedIn move into top position within one month of the launch and saw nearly 200,000 members join by the end of the second month (2). LinkedIn also enables its members to create multiple profiles in up to 41 different languages, fostering international engagement and knowledge transfer. Kevin Eyres, European Managing Director at LinkedIn commented, “Europe has adopted LinkedIn with incredible speed, bringing together the collective knowledge, expertise and opportunities of a vibrant mix of business cultures.” He continued, “Our success is based on a strong user-focussed approach and supported by a proven mix of revenues from advertising, job search, subscriptions and corporate recruiting. We’re seeing substantial growth in cross-language connections proving that the universal language of business is the network itself, whatever language it’s in.” The latest figures from LinkedIn in Q4 2008 demonstrate that steady growth across Europe was driven by a constant flow of innovations and developments to the product. Beyond the French and Spanish platforms and multiple-language profile capability, the company also introduced the LinkedIn Intelligent Applications (InApps) platform which enables companies to develop professional applications for the network. LinkedIn has worked with a selection of leading companies and applications from Amazon, Box.net, Google, Huddle, Six Apart, SlideShare, Tripit and WordPress are now available to LinkedIn members. Key trends amongst LinkedIn’s European users (3): More than 30% of LinkedIn’s total European membership comes from the IT, banking/finance and marketing/advertising sectors New members working in renewable energy helped drive growth across Europe, ranking as one of the top 10 fastest growing sectors across in the UK, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands In France alone, there was a 55% increase in new members from the environment and renewable energy sector Membership in the technology sector is growing across the board: semi conductor sector is up 43% in the UK and 55% in Spain, IT services is up 41% in France and electrical and electronic manufacturing up 47% in Germany Over 25% of the professional population in the Netherlands is on LinkedIn Financial crisis driving users to LinkedIn: Despite being avid early adopters, there have been surges in users from the UK financial services (up 35%) and banking sector (up 42%) The retail sector is also making good use of the network, with the UK and Spain seeing membership rises from the sector of 37% and 52%, respectively Economic turbulence is also causing Spain (up 60%) and UK (up 40%) to see a rise in the recruitment and staffing sector as employers smarten up the way they search for fresh talent While LinkedIn is widely recognised as a valuable resource for both members looking for a new job as well as recruitment and HR professionals, staffing and recruiting is only the ninth highest sector of LinkedIn’s European membership. Increasingly, people are turning to LinkedIn to help them solve problems and discuss business issues with people they trust – rather than just find a new job. “In today’s turbulent environment, people need to be able to interact with and leverage their professional network – no matter where in the world they may be and regardless of the languages they speak,” said Eyres. “More than 35 million professionals come to LinkedIn to share ideas, exchange knowledge and seek advice. As we will continue to expand the site into additional languages and markets, it means the entire LinkedIn community will have access to a more global and diverse resource.” A strong and attractive network of professionals flock to LinkedIn, with high-profile personalities on the site including executives of every company on the Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 alongside names such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Barack Obama.

The French platform reaches out to the world’s 175 million French speakers1, plus the 85 million people who are learning French. “Far from being a language on its way out, French is the 9th most spoken language in the world. It’s also the only language besides English to be spoken on all five continents. Its use in the business community should not be neglected!” He added. LinkedIn, an asset for the competitiveness of companies of all sizes As the financial crisis lingers, networking is a key asset for all players in the French economy, particularly small and medium enterprises. Indeed, statistics show that SMEs with an international focus are more competitive2. Now more than ever, it is in SMEs’ interest to hook up to a genuinely international network that will help them to find the ideal trade partner, expert or representative in almost any country. “In the current context, companies large and small need all the tools they can get to face increased local and international competition, while making optimal use of financial and human resources. To overcome the crisis and even boost their competitiveness, it has become even more important to share knowledge. Now more than ever, professional networking is an asset for the competitiveness of SMEs,” explained Kevin Eyres, LinkedIn’s MD Europe. The professional network is a source of knowledge that enables companies and individuals to get the right information on time to act best on while developing, innovating and collaborating.

We also know over 75% of our members are university educated and are decision makers within their company” Eyres added.

LinkedIn partners will be able to build LinkedIn features into their applications, enabling LinkedIn users to access to their professional networks wherever and whenever they need it to accomplish professional tasks. Using a set of LinkedIn APIs and widgets, partner sites using the Intelligent Application Platform will be augmented with business networking features allowing the 17 million LinkedIn users to be more productive on those sites. “The goal of the Intelligent Applications Platform is to help make our users more effective by providing them with access to the intelligence of their professional network both on LinkedIn and on other sites they visit to get work done,” said Dan Nye, CEO of LinkedIn. “Our focus is 100% professional, so we will be working with select business partners to build high value, high productivity applications.” LinkedIn’s first publishing partner, BusinessWeek, is developing an Intelligent Application that will reside on the BusinessWeek website. The application will enable readers of BusinessWeek.com to access their professional network to look up profiles of people and find connections at companies featured in articles. “We believe our LinkedIn application will strengthen our connection to professionals by enabling them to easily tap into their professional networks while reading BusinessWeek content,” said Roger Neal, Senior Vice President of BusinessWeek Digital. “The ability to have this information will make BusinessWeek's high quality content more useful and actionable for our users.” With the Intelligent Applications Platform, LinkedIn is also including the ability to develop applications that will run within LinkedIn using the OpenSocial development model. As a demonstration of what will be possible, a sample application was featured as part of Google’s OpenSocial announcement in early November 2007. The conference calendar application has a view of upcoming events and people in one’s LinkedIn network who are attending upcoming conferences. Dates are color-coded to indicate how popular the conferences are amongst a user’s professional network, and users can see suggestions of people they may want to meet at the conference based on common network connections. “As the web continues to distribute, there is a growing demand for applications that work across multiple platforms” said Jeremiah Owyang, Senior Analyst, Forrester Research. “Extending useful business applications on top of existing business communities will bring a new opportunity for efficiency — business communities will be more productive.” For more information about the LinkedIn’s InApps developer program, email: developers@linkedin.com.

The funds will support the company’s rapidly growing user base, continued global expansion and investments in new products and markets. In 2003, LinkedIn secured $4.7 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital, and in 2004 received a Series B round of $10 million from Greylock. “After reaching profitability in March 2006, now is a strategic time for us to acquire additional investment at favorable valuation,” said Reid Hoffman, CEO and Chairman, LinkedIn Corporation. “We selected Bessemer and EFF from many financing options, because of their global footprint, broad expertise and track record of investing across many industries, all of which can benefit from the power of LinkedIn.” With this investment, Bessemer expands its portfolio of Web 2.0 companies. In addition to LinkedIn, Bessemer has also funded Skype, Yelp and Wikia. “We got to know LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman through working with him as a co-investor on launching Wikia, and we’re delighted that he has selected us as his equity partner,” said David Cowan, Managing Partner of Bessemer Venture Partners. “As heavy users of LinkedIn for deal flow, due diligence and hiring, we have seen first-hand how profoundly LinkedIn promises to transform several service markets.” Focusing on early stage internet and wireless technologies, European Founders Fund is a highly selective investment company run by brothers Marc, Oliver and Alexander Samwer. The Samwer brothers founded alando (which became eBay Germany), and Jamba! (today part of News Corp.), and the internet companies they created have achieved combined sales of more than 1 billion EUR. With EFF, the Samwers are focused on investing in young technology companies, including European market leaders Leadpoint and LokaListen, to which they can bring their direct experience and extensive network of partners. “We wanted to invest in LinkedIn, because we see the enormous international potential as more professionals recognize the power of online networks,” said Oliver Samwer, founder, EFF. “Our investment supports their expansion and our established connections offer potential strategic alliances, partnership opportunities, and sharing of insights to continue building LinkedIn in Europe and beyond.” LinkedIn has 9 million members worldwide and is growing at a rate of 100,000 members a week. While standard LinkedIn accounts are free, the company earns revenue through a number of premium services such as InMail, advertising, job listings, premium search, candidate sourcing capabilities and custom corporate subscription packages. The company recently launched LinkedIn Answers, a first-of-its-kind service that allows members to ask trusted contacts in the network business-related questions. LinkedIn has more than 350 corporate customers, covering a spectrum of industries including tech giants Microsoft, eBay, Intuit and Adobe, leading mass market retailers such as Circuit City, Target and Walmart.com, and top consumer brands such as L’Oreal and NetFlix. Advertisers on LinkedIn currently include Jeep, Best Buy, Target, American Express, American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic Airlines.

LinkedIn’s premium accounts were introduced just seven months ago and are priced between $60 and $2,000 per year. LinkedIn closed venture capital rounds of $4.7 million and $10 million in November 2003 and October 2004, respectively, and will not require any additional investment to fund business operations. LinkedIn’s emphasis for the next six to nine months will be to broaden the utility of its offerings that are free to all members. Currently, the most active members are those who frequently need to contact professionals as part of their job: recruiters, analysts, researchers, investment professionals, entrepreneurs and management consultants. Hiring managers and job seekers also search on LinkedIn whenever they need to identify top recruits or inside connections to employers. Relationships matter to professionals across all industries and functions, and LinkedIn’s product initiatives for 2006 aim to make LinkedIn the most useful business web site for over ten million professionals across the globe. Recently, LinkedIn launched new features to help members re-connect with past co-workers and classmates free of charge. In the coming months, LinkedIn will provide its members with updates about their colleagues on their home pages, including who has a new email address, who got promoted and who is hiring – making it fast and easy for members to stay in touch and strengthen ties with their existing network of business contacts. And as most seasoned professionals know, the best opportunities tend to come through one’s network of relationships. Increasingly, success in business is no longer based on what or even who you know, but who your contacts know. LinkedIn is developing sophisticated matching technology to identify relevant contacts for members among the people their connections know. For job seekers, LinkedIn has already begun recommending jobs offered by people their colleagues know. This matching takes into account the individual career history of members as well as likely future career progression based on the aggregate data of LinkedIn profiles created by over five million professionals around the world. For example, if a member has been a sales manager for three years and people with this background tend to either move into sales director or field marketing roles, LinkedIn highlights open positions with those titles currently offered by people his or her connections know. Recently, LinkedIn has given members the ability to optimize their LinkedIn profile for pickup by leading Internet search engines. In 2006, people search is expected to become another major vertical in the Internet search category. More and more professionals will want to make sure they put their best foot forward when employers, prospects and business partners search for them, whether on generic search engines or specialized people search engines like LinkedIn or Ziggs. Later this month, anyone visiting the LinkedIn site will be able to search for people on LinkedIn and find profiles maintained by professionals who have joined LinkedIn. However, to get details, such as what former bosses, co-workers or business partners say about someone, visitors will need to sign up for a free LinkedIn membership. Membership has additional benefits not offered by regular search engines: LinkedIn members see shared professional connections and can get in touch with the people they find via introductions from people they already know. LinkedIn is committed to making people search smart and easy. For example, once members find someone who matches their criteria, they will be able to find professionals with similar characteristics with a single click. Also, members will be able to create search agents that notify them of new members who match their criteria. LinkedIn is already used frequently to look up people before business meetings to learn about the backgrounds and interests of other meeting attendees, like co-workers, suppliers or potential customers. Similarly, job seekers routinely look up the profiles of employees who will be interviewing them. Some job seekers even use LinkedIn to get in touch people who used to work for their potential future boss. When it comes to career success, degrees of separation are generally more important than academic degrees. As LinkedIn is becoming a profitable Internet business, the company has set its sights on becoming the most valuable web site for business users around the world. The company currently has 50 employees and will grow its staff based on increased revenue from premium accounts, job listings and advertising. The company is expecting the rate of membership growth to further accelerate in 2006. It took LinkedIn three years to gain five million members. Given current accelerating growth, the company anticipates that the next five million members will join LinkedIn over the next ten months and bring LinkedIn’s total membership to 10 million before the end of 2006. While a certain percentage of new members will directly contribute to the company’s bottom line by upgrading their account or posting a job, each new member adds value to the LinkedIn network by contributing his or her professional profile. The value of the network grows stronger with each new member: in new people and in trusted professional connections. Many will also click on an ad or invite their trusted contacts, so LinkedIn is expecting healthy revenue growth without needing to introduce new premium services in 2006.

On LinkedIn, more than 4.2 million professionals find jobs, people and service providers through their existing network of business relationships. LinkedIn offers five premium services.

Pro accounts provide an upgrade path for recruiters, researchers, and other existing Business account holders; Personal Plus accounts enhance the value of LinkedIn for service providers, networkers and job seekers. These new premium accounts complement the Business accounts launched in August and further validate LinkedIn’s business model of providing subscription-based premium services. LinkedIn’s revenue from subscriptions has quickly surpassed revenue from advertising while continuing to support rapid user growth. 900,000 professionals have joined LinkedIn since the launch of its first subscription products three months ago, bringing the total to more than 4.2 million registered users. LinkedIn created the new Pro accounts in response to the needs of recruiters, analysts, research professionals, and other Business account holders who frequently need to contact professionals as part of their job. Because many Business Plus account holders wanted to send more than 10 InMails per month to potential candidates and experts, LinkedIn is now providing Pro accounts as an upgrade option for Business account holders. Pro accounts are priced at $200 per month and enable users to send 50 InMails per month in order to get in touch professionals who are not reachable via introductions from their connections on LinkedIn. Pro account holders also receive more search results, more introductions, and a dedicated customer service staff. As a complement to the existing subscription offering that helps users to more effectively find candidates and experts, LinkedIn is launching a new Personal Plus account level that is ideal for users who want to maximize their chances of being found on LinkedIn by potential clients, employers or other professionals. The target audience for the new Personal Plus accounts is professional service providers, networkers and job seekers. Each of these groups makes up roughly 5 to 10 percent of LinkedIn’s user base, so the combined target for this new subscription offering is significantly broader than that of the Business and Pro accounts. Personal Plus gives professionals the visibility they deserve. By making themselves accessible to OpenLink messages, Personal Plus account holders make it easy for more than 4.2 million LinkedIn users to contact them directly for business opportunities. A Personal Plus account gives service providers and job seekers the ability to allow potential clients or employers to get in touch with them without having to purchase InMails or ask their connections for introductions. OpenLink messages work similar to a toll-free number; any LinkedIn user can send a message directly to any account holder who has OpenLink turned on free of charge. However, for added privacy protection, OpenLink does not require users to publish their email address to receive messages directly from other users. OpenLink messages are delivered to a user’s primary email address without revealing that email address to the sender. Personal Plus account holders may also join the OpenLink Network, which is an opt-in network of professionals within the LinkedIn Network. By joining the OpenLink Network, professionals can find like-minded users who believe in the importance of being easily accessible and who want to maximize their visibility among other professionals who are actively looking to build new business relationships. Personal Plus account holders can also contact more users via introductions, receive priority customer service, and get access to forum sessions with LinkedIn executives as well as receive sneak peeks of future product enhancements. Pricing for Personal Plus accounts is $60 per year. Both new account types are now available. Business and Pro account holders automatically receive access to the new Personal Plus features. LinkedIn’s CEO Reid Hoffman said, “When users are paying $200 per month for access to a business network like LinkedIn, it is clear that we have managed to create significant value for our users. Our new Personal Plus accounts reflect the increasing search volume on LinkedIn, and the fact that a significant portion of our user base is willing to pay for increased visibility on LinkedIn and for maximizing inbound career or business opportunities.” About LinkedIn LinkedIn is the world’s largest and most effective business network.

Since its launch in May 2003, more than 3.3 million professionals have joined the LinkedIn Network. Users search the LinkedIn Network an average of four million times per month. Popular searches include finding business partners, former colleagues, and hiring managers. However, LinkedIn’s most active searchers are recruiters, investment professionals, management consultants, analysts, and market researchers. For recruiters, finding the right candidate can mean tens of thousands of dollars in placement fees. For hedge fund managers or venture capitalists, finding and gathering insights from the right due-diligence sources can make or break investment decisions. LinkedIn’s new premium service provides more powerful search tools to these professionals, addressing their need to find the right job candidates and experts quickly and efficiently. Users who upgrade to a Business account gain access to more powerful search tools. By upgrading, recruiters and researchers can find job candidates and experts not just from their networks, but also from the complete LinkedIn Network of 3.3 million registered professionals. Many users will now search a space 10 times larger and will be 10 times more likely to find the right person. LinkedIn also now provides a new communication mechanism called InMail™ to Business account holders. While contacting a user through introductions is likely to yield the highest response rate, InMail provides the fastest replies and gives Business account holders the option to send confidential information directly to users, without exposing it to intermediaries providing an introduction. And InMail is the only way to reach LinkedIn users more than three degrees away. No contact information is ever shared with anyone on LinkedIn without a user’s explicit consent, and the profiles of users shown in the LinkedIn Network results are kept anonymous, so users are protected from unwanted phone calls or emails. When users receive an InMail, they can review the sender’s full profile including the InMail Feedback rating, which indicates how well the sender generally targets his or her proposals. If the recipient decides to pursue an opportunity received through InMail, the sender receives the recipient’s name and contact information, and the sender’s InMail Feedback rating gets updated to reflect the successful contact. LinkedIn Personal accounts are and always will remain free, including the ability to create and update a professional profile, to search one’s network, and to contact other LinkedIn users through introductions. In addition to the new capabilities provided to Business account holders, today’s release also provides significant enhancements to LinkedIn users with free Personal accounts, such as improved communications management, streamlined introductions and better tools for locating people they already know. LinkedIn’s CEO Reid Hoffman said, “It took us 15 months to reach one million users, six months to reach two million and just four more months to reach three million users. Premium services for power searchers, such as recruiters and researchers, have been part of our business plan from the beginning. This fall, in addition to providing more productivity features for users of our premium services, we intend to intend to make significant enhancements to the free capabilities available to everyone who relies on LinkedIn to manage their professional relationships.” Business account holders receive a seven-day response guarantee on InMails, priority service from LinkedIn’s customer service staff, and the ability to get introduced to more professionals in their networks. To ensure Business account holders are selective in whom they contact, they can only contact 3 or 10 users through InMail per month, depending on whether they have a Business or Business Plus account. Pricing is $15 per month for Business accounts and $50 per month for Business Plus accounts. Timothy Farrelly, president of Coit Staffing, has placed many candidates using LinkedIn and looks forward to being among the first LinkedIn users to upgrade to a Business account. He added, “LinkedIn has become the place where top recruiters look for passive candidates. The quality of professionals who have joined the network and published their professional profile makes LinkedIn the most productive place to find and reach candidates for senior-level positions. The new search and contact options make it a no-brainer to upgrade virtually my entire staff to LinkedIn Business accounts.” The new Business account option is expected to broaden LinkedIn’s appeal beyond existing LinkedIn power searchers. With the new capabilities available to Business account holders, professionals such as recruiters and researchers can realize business value immediately, not just after connecting with their existing contacts on LinkedIn. At the same time, InMail provides users with a brokered communications channel through which they can be contacted for interesting business or career opportunities in a private and controlled manner. In March, LinkedIn launched LinkedIn Jobs, the company’s first premium service. LinkedIn Jobs allows recruiters and hiring managers to ask fellow employees and other trusted contacts for referrals and to conduct reference checks. Since then, the company has released two additional premium services, LinkedIn Services and LinkedIn for Groups. Over the next six months, the company expects the new Business accounts to provide a significant additional revenue stream that will help LinkedIn reach its target of becoming a profitable business in the first quarter of 2006. About LinkedIn LinkedIn is the world’s largest and most effective business network. On LinkedIn, more than 3.3 million professionals find jobs, people and service providers through their existing network of business relationships. LinkedIn offers four premium services.

On LinkedIn Jobs, candidates not only find open positions that match their interests, but also get background information on the job poster that can help them tailor their cover letter. More importantly, job seekers can learn which of their existing professional contacts can introduce them to the hiring manager or recruiter — or to someone who knows these key contacts. Candidates who come referred by a company employee have a significantly higher chance of landing a job than those who apply via traditional Internet job boards. According to a recent study by CareerXroads, employee referrals account for 28.5 percent of external hires, while the largest online job board accounts for only 2.8 percent of external hires. Since referrals are the preferred source of candidates for employers, LinkedIn Jobs dramatically increases the chances that job seekers land the job they want by helping them identify which of their existing contacts can refer them to the hiring manager or to someone who knows the hiring manager. Rob Sullivan, author of Getting Your Foot in the Door When You Don’t Have a Leg to Stand On, explains, “LinkedIn Jobs is unlike anything currently available. It enables candidates to network their way into target companies on the strength of their existing business relationships. At the same time, companies benefit because they gain a ready-made network of referrals and independent references for the candidates under consideration. For companies, this is particularly compelling because it provides valuable insights into the trustworthiness, reliability and work ethic of potential candidates — factors that are difficult to assess through resumes and interviews alone.” Hiring managers, HR professionals and recruiters have flocked to LinkedIn Jobs because it enables them to leverage referrals from their existing professional relationships to prioritize applicants and to discover which of their own contacts know people who have had experience working with the candidate. 75 percent of all listings posted on LinkedIn Jobs so far have been for mid-to-senior levels, and 7 percent have been posted for senior executive positions. Said LinkedIn user Allan Techko, regional recruiting manager at Compuware Corporation, who filled a project manager position using LinkedIn Jobs, “By posting our open positions on LinkedIn, I was able to reach a pool of candidates that is not available on traditional job boards. Since professionals use LinkedIn to find business partners, industry experts and recommended service providers, LinkedIn Jobs gives me access to a group of highly-qualified candidates who are currently employed and therefore not spending their time on Internet job boards.” Another LinkedIn user, Will Lopes, VP and general manager at Audible, had tried various job sites including CareerBuilder and Craigslist to find the right candidate for a director of project management position. Within one day of posting the position on LinkedIn Jobs, Will received Stephen Harris’ application, and it instantly stood out. “The resume looked similar to some of the others I had received, but I saw on his LinkedIn profile that David Simpson, a former colleague of mine at Audible, knew Stephen. Stephen had also asked David to reach out to me via LinkedIn about his application, and David sang Stephen’s praises. I asked Stephen to come in for an interview right away. He was highly qualified and the interviews went very well. As a result, we extended him an offer for a full-time position, which he accepted.” For Stephen, the job listing on LinkedIn stood out when he saw that one of his contacts used to work at Audible and was linked to Will Lopes. “I had no idea that I was so close to someone at the company, and I appreciated being able to learn more about Will and the company through some of the people we both knew,” he said. In a recent survey of LinkedIn users who searched for a job on LinkedIn, 58 percent of the 1,400 respondents rated having an inside connection to the hiring manager as very important; 51 percent of respondents rated it as somewhat or very likely that they will find their next job through LinkedIn Jobs. LinkedIn is committed to helping professionals find inside connections for jobs whether or not the position is listed on LinkedIn. To support this endeavor, the company also today released the LinkedIn JobsInsider, a browser companion that informs users which of their existing contacts know people who work at target companies as they search major Internet job boards. The LinkedIn JobsInsider operates entirely in the background. It only activates when users search major job boards. At that point, a research pane opens on the left-hand side of the browser showing users inside connections they have to the company posting the position. All employees listed at the target company are registered LinkedIn users who have specifically indicated that they are willing to help job seekers by providing them with additional information about the position or referring them on to the hiring manager. Job seekers can then choose which of their own contacts they’d like to make the introduction to help them land the job they want. “Almost half of the contact requests we have facilitated so far have been related to employers looking to hire, or professionals seeking out new positions,” said LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman. “With over $8 billion in revenue and significant dissatisfaction from both hiring companies and job seekers with the status quo, the recruiting industry is an attractive market for us. However, over half of the activity on LinkedIn is unrelated to hiring, so we will also be launching additional premium services to help users be more effective in their work. We expect these premium services to take us to profitability by early next year.” LinkedIn already aggregates over 300,000 job listings and expects to reach over a million job listings this summer, so it is a compelling place for any professional to start their job search. There is no charge for professionals to view or apply to positions listed on LinkedIn Jobs. LinkedIn users also have an opportunity to showcase their reputation through a LinkedIn profile, which can include public references from former managers and colleagues in addition to past positions and accomplishments. There is no charge for maintaining a professional profile on LinkedIn. Hiring managers, HR professionals and recruiters can list positions on LinkedIn for $95 per job. Listings run for 30 days, and there is an option to promote jobs on the LinkedIn home page for an additional fee. There is a 50 percent discount for the first job users post. Invoicing and subscription packages are available for HR departments and recruiting firms wishing to purchase listings in bulk.

The investment was led by Greylock, the early-stage venture capital firm that has produced the largest number of initial public offerings. Of the over 250 companies Greylock has funded, 120 are now publicly held. LinkedIn also announced the recent addition of 14 angel investors, including Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape and chairman of Opsware, Joe Kraus, co-founder of Excite, Josh Kopelman , founder of Half.com, and Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal. Sequoia Capital, the venture capitalists behind Google and Yahoo! and the lead investors in LinkedIn’s Series A round, also participated in the Series B financing. Since Sequoia’s Series A funding eleven months ago, LinkedIn’s network of registered professionals has grown 30-fold from 40,000 to 1.2 million. During the same period, the number of connected contacts has increased from under one million to over 50 million. LinkedIn’s networking tools enable users to strengthen and extend their existing network of trusted business contacts in a systematic and time-efficient manner. Once connected on LinkedIn, professionals can search the extended networks of their contacts and discover inside connections to companies with whom they want to partner. Professionals also frequently use LinkedIn to find recommended employees and to obtain introductions to hard-to-reach industry experts. LinkedIn has already facilitated over 250,000 introductions to help users reach job candidates, industry experts and business partners. Over 30 percent of these introductions were related to business partnerships, and 25 percent were for recruiting and reference checking. Recruiting has emerged as one of the most popular applications of LinkedIn’s online networking tools. By allowing hiring managers to find candidates through referrals from colleagues and business partners, LinkedIn mirrors the time-tested, real-world process of hiring employees based on recommendations from one’s existing network of trusted contacts. The investment from Greylock comes at a time when over 120 industry conferences, professional organizations and alumni associations have adopted LinkedIn for Groups, and usage of the LinkedIn search engine has doubled from one million searches per month in July to over two million searches per month in September. David Sze, general partner at Greylock, commented, “We see LinkedIn as hitting the tipping point — it is poised to transform a number of large existing markets. In the United States alone, businesses spend over $8 billion per year to recruit talent. We also believe that LinkedIn’s contact and networking products can add tremendous value for every business professional.” Sze will be joining the LinkedIn Board of Directors. The company also announced the addition of Rob DeSantis, co-founder and former chief marketing officer of Ariba, to the Board of Directors. LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, who was most recently the executive vice president of PayPal, said, “Our strategy from the beginning has been to attract an elite group of businesspeople through a tool that protects their privacy, their inbox and their existing professional relationships. Having attracted a large number of venture capitalists and senior executives in over 130 industries, the LinkedIn network has now established itself far and away as the largest and most useful online business network across the globe.” Launched in May 2003, LinkedIn already has 370,000 registered users in Europe and 70,000 in Asia. A new professional joins the LinkedIn network every five seconds during business hours. The Series B funding will be used primarily to accelerate the development of tools for premium services and to power LinkedIn’s continued international expansion. The company does not anticipate the need for additional financing and expects to reach profitability with this round of investment.

The investment was led by Sequoia Capital, the venture investors behind well-known Internet brands such as Yahoo!, Google and PayPal. Sequoia Capital is also an investor in Plaxo, the leading contact updating tool. Through the real-world business successes of its users, LinkedIn has demonstrated that even established executives increase their business effectiveness and career success by using a referral-based professional networking tool. LinkedIn not only enables professionals to discover inside connections they never knew they had, but also allows them to receive referrals to deal makers, hiring managers and other highly sought-after executives through the people they already know and trust. Sequoia Capital’s investment underscores the significant business opportunity involved in re-engineering several large and existing markets. For example, employers and employees will spend nearly $8 billion this year to find each other through the Internet, classifieds and recruiting firms. While online job boards have become popular, they rarely work for job seekers, and hiring managers are overwhelmed with resumes and “cold” emails from strangers. LinkedIn is the only tool that mirrors the most successful process for finding a job and hiring employees and contractors: it allows both job seekers and hiring managers to find each other through referrals from their real-world connections. “The business potential for social software is quite limited. In contrast, LinkedIn is squarely focused on trusted business referrals, which is how business gets done and for which real money gets spent every day and all over the world,” said Mark Kvamme, partner at Sequoia Capital. “LinkedIn provides both patented and effective technology that has the power to transform hiring—very much in the way PayPal re-engineered the transfer of money and Google dramatically increased the utility of the Internet for individual consumers and professionals.” Kvamme is joining LinkedIn’s board of directors. LinkedIn’s management team is led by CEO Reid Hoffman, who co-founded SocialNet in 1997 and was most recently the executive vice president of PayPal. “We are very pleased with the rapid adoption of LinkedIn among hiring managers, venture capitalists and executives from public companies in a broad set of industries,” said Hoffman. “It is particularly gratifying to see that it took less than two months for LinkedIn to help hiring managers not only reach top talent through referrals, but also interview and hire them.” Facts, Figures and Trends Over 20,000 hiring managers have already signed up for LinkedIn. The referral system ensures that they can only be approached by candidates who come recommended by someone they already know and trust. Due to this powerful pre-screening from trusted professionals, LinkedIn users only receive requests of high value to them. In fact, LinkedIn users accept over 76 percent of all referred contact requests, which is 20 to 50 times higher than the acceptance rate of email requests that arrive without a referral from a trusted source. Since LinkedIn is already facilitating over 1,000 successful referrals per month and is doubling in size every six weeks, the additional funding will be used primarily to accelerate the development of additional tools that will provide even greater utility to professionals in all industries and across the globe. In just six months, LinkedIn has spread far from its Silicon Valley roots, already gaining users in over 80 countries and 120 industries. LinkedIn’s early success is propelled by several key trends affecting today’s business professional: Layoffs and accelerating business change drive professionals to see themselves as “Me Inc.” 33 million contractors and micro-businesses see referrals as their best source of client leads Jobs are 10 times more likely to be found through referrals than through Internet job boards Hiring managers have learned that referred candidates are more likely to make successful hires What is Unique About LinkedIn? LinkedIn is committed exclusively to the individual professional as its only customer and its highest priority. LinkedIn works because it is based on strong ties, explicit participation and mutual consent between professionals who know and trust each other. Unlike networking services geared to singles and salespeople, LinkedIn has been able to attract a user base of successful professionals and executives by providing the most powerful and effective set of privacy and email inbox protections. LinkedIn allows successful professionals to better leverage their existing network of business contacts. It not only helps opportunities from within their network to find them, but also enables users to proactively contact hard-to-reach business people. By leveraging their professional network using LinkedIn, even the most successful executives can improve their business effectiveness and accelerate their career success.
