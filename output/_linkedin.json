    "description": "This month, we’re looking at the increased demand for data scientists as data science skills shortages spread beyond the finance and tech industries. Just three years ago, there was a national surplus of people with data science skills — an employer in Dallas or Atlanta who wanted to hire a data scientist had plenty of options since there were few local shortages. But as more industries turn to big data, the national shortage has grown to 151,717 people, based on employer hiring demand. The U.S. cities with particularly acute shortages are New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles.",

    "description": "Las Vegas — October 18, 2011 — LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network with more than 120 million members, today announced LinkedIn Talent Pipeline, a new solution for recruiters which will give them the ability to more easily manage all of their talent leads in one place, helping them recruit the best talent more quickly. The announcement was made onstage by LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner in front of more than 1,800 recruiting professionals at the company’s Talent Connect customer event in Las Vegas, Nevada.  With the rise of social media, recruiters are dealing with an increase in online networks as sources of talent who may not be actively seeking a new job. This is in addition to more traditional sources such as personal referrals, conferences, job boards and company career sites. This shift toward recruiting ‘passive’ talent gives recruiters access to a much larger pool of potential candidates with the right skills and experience than if they relied on active candidates alone. Talent Pipeline will allow recruiters to keep track of all of these potential candidates in one place, even before they enter the formal application process.  Speaking on the announcement, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner commented, “Recruiters are actively looking for more talent from more sources and managing all their talent leads across multiple tools. With LinkedIn Talent Pipeline, we’re extending our Recruiter platform and continuing our focus to connect talent with opportunity on a massive scale by providing a single place to manage and update these leads, wherever they are found.”  Because most passive candidates have not formally applied for a job, they are not tracked in a company’s Applicant Tracking System (ATS). As a result, many recruiters are simply tracking leads in their own spreadsheets - a tool designed for crunching numbers, not tracking, nurturing and collaborating on recruitment.   James Holincheck, Managing Vice President of Human Capital Management at Gartner commented, “One of the most frequent things we hear from enterprises today is a desire to better manage the increasing number of talent sources. Recruiters know that passive candidates are an important source of talent and want better tools to capture this opportunity.”   Today, companies that try to create a separate database for leads spend significant time and effort to implement a new system and process, only to find they haven’t solved the problem of stale information. The moment someone changes a title, job or location, the original lead or resume is out-of-date and the database becomes less valuable. LinkedIn Talent Pipeline solves this problem:",

    "description": "Las Vegas — October 18, 2011 — LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network with more than 120 million members, today announced LinkedIn Talent Pipeline, a new solution for recruiters which will give them the ability to more easily manage all of their talent leads in one place, helping them recruit the best talent more quickly. The announcement was made onstage by LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner in front of more than 1,800 recruiting professionals at the company’s Talent Connect customer event in Las Vegas, Nevada.  With the rise of social media, recruiters are dealing with an increase in online networks as sources of talent who may not be actively seeking a new job. This is in addition to more traditional sources such as personal referrals, conferences, job boards and company career sites. This shift toward recruiting ‘passive’ talent gives recruiters access to a much larger pool of potential candidates with the right skills and experience than if they relied on active candidates alone. Talent Pipeline will allow recruiters to keep track of all of these potential candidates in one place, even before they enter the formal application process.  Speaking on the announcement, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner commented, “Recruiters are actively looking for more talent from more sources and managing all their talent leads across multiple tools. With LinkedIn Talent Pipeline, we’re extending our Recruiter platform and continuing our focus to connect talent with opportunity on a massive scale by providing a single place to manage and update these leads, wherever they are found.”  Because most passive candidates have not formally applied for a job, they are not tracked in a company’s Applicant Tracking System (ATS). As a result, many recruiters are simply tracking leads in their own spreadsheets - a tool designed for crunching numbers, not tracking, nurturing and collaborating on recruitment.   James Holincheck, Managing Vice President of Human Capital Management at Gartner commented, “One of the most frequent things we hear from enterprises today is a desire to better manage the increasing number of talent sources. Recruiters know that passive candidates are an important source of talent and want better tools to capture this opportunity.”   Today, companies that try to create a separate database for leads spend significant time and effort to implement a new system and process, only to find they haven’t solved the problem of stale information. The moment someone changes a title, job or location, the original lead or resume is out-of-date and the database becomes less valuable. LinkedIn Talent Pipeline solves this problem:",

Apply with LinkedIn is the next phase of our open platform effort and we hope an important catalyst in creating economic opportunity for our members,” said Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn.   By clicking the new Apply with LinkedIn button on a company’s website, consumers and companies alike will be able to find more opportunities, candidates and insights that will ultimately help them land them their dream job or dream candidate.   “Apply with LinkedIn provides an easy way for job seekers to put their best foot forward when applying for new opportunities and demonstrates a confidence in their professional identity and brand which showcases their acquired skills, experiences and professional connections,” said Deep Nishar, SVP of products and user experience at LinkedIn. “Companies also gain access to one of the most qualified and coveted talent pools of more than 100 million LinkedIn professionals around the world.”  For Job Applicants When job applicants click the Apply with LinkedIn button, they will have the opportunity to edit their profile before submitting or they can go directly to the one-click “Submit Application” button, which will automatically send the candidate’s public LinkedIn profile data to the employer or pre-populate the employer's online employment application. Applicants receive immediate confirmation of their submission and will be prompted with professional connections that they can contact to increase their chances of getting hired at the company. Job candidates will also be able to manage any job submissions using the Apply with LinkedIn button when they go to their LinkedIn.com “Saved Jobs” tab to allow for added efficiency and organization in their job search.  For Companies Thousands of companies have the Apply with LinkedIn plugin accessible on their websites today, including LinkedIn, Netflix, LivingSocial, Photobucket, Concur subsidiary TripIt, Foodspotting, GazeHawk, Munch On Me, and Formative Labs. LinkedIn has also teamed up with key Applicant Tracking System (ATS) partners who have enabled the Apply with LinkedIn plugin for their customers today, including Peoplefluent, Jobvite, SmartRecruiters, Bullhorn, and Jobscience. By integrating Apply with LinkedIn as an additional option for job candidates, the corporate world’s most active employers can increase the quality of their applicant flow and their ability to identify and qualify high-quality candidates. In addition, Taleo, Lumesse, and Kenexa have announced that they will implement the Apply with LinkedIn technology by the end of the year. Companies will have the option to customize the plugin and will be able to add up to three questions for the applicant to complete, such as a candidate’s willingness to relocate, option to add a cover letter, or customized questions. The plugin can be tailored to a company’s existing applicant tracking service and may offer varying features based on their ATS partner. Companies interested in integrating Apply with LinkedIn can download the free plugin on apply.linkedin.com.",

This latest expansion follows the opening of LinkedIn’s Paris office in March and Singapore in May, and brings the number of LinkedIn offices in Europe up to five, including London, Dublin and Amsterdam.   Ariel Eckstein, managing director of LinkedIn EMEA, will oversee the expansion of the team in Stockholm as part of his role in driving the company’s diverse business model comprised of hiring solutions, marketing solutions and member subscriptions. In the near-term, this will include a focus on member engagement, marketing, and developing customer relationships.  Commenting on the announcement, Eckstein said, “There are nearly 25 million European professionals now establishing their professional identities, building their networks and gaining access to insights and opportunities on LinkedIn. As such, we’re growing our presence to offer better support both for the members, as well as our growing customer base. The Nordics are some of the most penetrated markets worldwide in terms of Internet use, and this is reflected in their adoption of professional networking online. Our members in the region are both engaged locally and well-connected globally.”  Founded in 2003, LinkedIn is now the world’s largest professional network with more than half of its members based outside of the U.S. Roughly one million new members join LinkedIn every week, equivalent to more than one joining every second. Recent product innovations, such as LinkedIn Today and Signal, help professionals filter the growing amount of daily information and news to help them make better business decisions.   Brands such as FinAir, Statoil and Visit Denmark use LinkedIn’s Marketing Solution products to connect their products and services with LinkedIn audience of educated, affluent and influential professionals.

    "description": "Singapore – May 31, 2011 – LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), the world’s largest professional network with more than 100 million members worldwide, today announced that it is opening the company’s Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. The Singapore office will serve as the regional headquarters to more than 18 million LinkedIn members in Asia Pacific and Japan. Supporting existing markets in Australia and India, the Singapore headquarters will also be used as a launch pad for further regional expansion. The company’s office in Japan is set to open later this year.   Arvind Rajan, Managing Director and Vice-President, Asia Pacific and Japan, will be responsible for driving the company’s diverse business model comprised of recruitment licensing solutions, advertising sales and member subscriptions. In the near-term, this will include a focus on membership engagement, sales and marketing, and strategic regional partnerships.   Commenting on the announcement, Rajan said, “LinkedIn is a truly global network. We understand that to be a worldwide network for professionals, you need to be local and relevant to them at home. Singapore is a hub for talent, and we are establishing our regional headquarters here to serve as a gateway to the rest of the region, to enhance local market understanding, and to develop further strategic relationships.”   With more than 4,000 multinational companies headquartered in Singapore, including more than one-third of Fortune 500 corporations, Singapore’s skilled talent base and strong government support, is well-positioned with LinkedIn’s aim of connecting talent with opportunity. Seventy-three of the Fortune 100 companies around the world use LinkedIn for talent acquisition.  Recruiters rely on LinkedIn’s large talent pool to find ‘passive’ candidates - highly skilled professionals who are currently employed. These passive candidates may not be actively seeking a new job opportunity but might be the best suited for key roles. At the same time, professionals in Asia Pacific are recognising the growing importance of their online personal brand in the changing social media landscape. comScore reports that LinkedIn visitors from Asia Pacific increased by 132 percent from March 2010 to March 2011.  “These are exciting times for LinkedIn. Our membership across Asia Pacific is being driven by professionals using LinkedIn to network, build their online brand, gain insights from the community and find new career or business opportunities,\" said Rajan. \"We intend to focus our efforts on delivering the best product experience for our members in their careers, the brand marketers who want to reach them, and the recruiters who are looking to hire the best talent,” he added.",
