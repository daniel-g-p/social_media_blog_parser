potentially harmful content particularly if it involves a child on instagram we recently introduced new features to make it even more difficult for suspicious adults to interact with teens now these adults will no longer be able to see teen accounts when scrolling through the list of people who have liked a post or when looking at an accounts followers or following list if a suspicious adult follows a teen account we will send that teen a notification prompting them to review and remove the new follower we are also prompting teens to review and restrict their privacy settings when someone comments on a teens post tags mentions them in another post or includes their content in reels remixes or guides the teen will receive a notification to review their privacy settings and will have the option to stop people from interacting with them weve developed more than 30 tools to support the safety of teens and families across our apps including supervision tools for parents and age verification technology that helps teens have age appropriate experiences online we also provide resources for teens that inform them of the potential harms of taking intimate images and the other

from a more compact live guide to a catch up on your favorites shelf check out youtube tvs latest redesign that helps streamline the user experience video format not supported from a more compact live guide to a catch up on your favorites shelf check out youtube tvs latest redesign that helps streamline the user experience welcome to the latest installment of our innovation series a behind the scenes look at how the youtube features find their way to your screen as told by the people who create them every tv fan knows theres so much great content to watch right now sometimes you want to watch highlights from the golden globes or marathon yellowstone episodes when its cold out but somehow we still spend too much time scrolling through channels just to find something to watch when we were building youtube tv our team spent a lot of time thinking about how we could make that experience better we even considered not having a live guide whatsoever but we decided we needed to meet our viewers where they are today we are walking you through the latest redesigns of youtube tvs live and library our teams philosophy is that youtube tv is tv made for you you may have already noticed the updated live guide in your app with new curated recommendations at the top a simplified design and more key information for each live show or movie were now starting to roll out updates to the library which will help you manage your content with improved content filtering and better organizational tools to make your library feel less cluttered users should begin seeing this redesign over the next few months we wanted to share our ux thinking behind these changes and how we kept our members and their viewing experience top of mind during the research and design process tv made for you how our team approaches each surface on youtube tv our teams philosophy is that youtube tv is tv made for you and this is threaded throughout the entire product experience across your live library and home these surfaces enable viewers to find whats on now browse what to watch and go back into content they may have missed before even sketching out designs the team took a step back to develop user focused key principles that would drive the redesign of these surfaces on youtube tv empower viewers with more control and choice so they can watch tv their wayanticipate tv watching needs by getting viewers the content they want with less effortrecognize different interests and viewing behaviorswe relied on user research from in home interviews app feedback surveys and concept testing to identify and prioritize design decisions some insights that influenced our approach decision fatigue is real when you turn on your tv with even more apps and channels than ever before viewers are looking for easier ways to find the content most relevant to them whether its jumping into a live game or seeing whats trending right now they also seek contextual information like shows description air date episode and key characters e g cast crew or athletes to not only decide what to watch but also check if something is worth their time viewers want more control our members enjoy youtube tvs unlimited dvr but those with larger libraries have a harder time finding exactly what to watch members have built up their libraries over time but programs they were interested in several years ago might no longer be relevant to them parents in particular offered us a key insight they often felt like their libraries were cluttered with kids content and they wanted a way to better see their own recordings the more their libraries grew the less usable they became due to the lack of tools to organize their shows movies and sports every second is valuable viewers want to jump back into most watched and find relevant programming airing right now without hunting for it everything we need to convey to them around watch progress freshness and relevance needs to be understood at a glance we have also learned that viewers want to easily record shows without going through multiple steps the hypotheses and results on live we added more details about each program to help you quickly decide what to watch live and library are the most used pages by youtube tv watchers so we decided to focus on improving those areas through hypotheses that went through rounds of iteration hypothesis 1 by assisting

you can access your account to date we have offered three methods of 2fa text message authentication app and security key while historically a popular form of 2fa unfortunately we have seen phone number based 2fa be used and abused by bad actors so starting today we will no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message sms method of 2fa unless they are twitter blue subscribers the availability of text message 2fa for twitter blue may vary by country and carrier non twitter blue subscribers that are already enrolled will have 30 days to disable this method and enroll in another after 20 march 2023 we will no longer permit non twitter blue subscribers to use text messages as a 2fa method at that time accounts with text message 2fa still enabled will have it disabled disabling

for teens were making further changes to their ad experiences we recognize that teens arent necessarily as equipped as adults to make decisions about how their online data is used for advertising particularly when it comes to showing them products available to purchase for that reason were further restricting the options advertisers have to reach teens as well as the information we use to show ads to teens were also introducing more teen specific controls and resources to help them understand how ads work and the reasons why they see certain ads on our apps these changes reflect research direct feedback from parents and child developmental experts un childrens rights principles and global regulation the changes were making previously we made changes to how advertisers can reach teens which included removing the ability for advertisers to target teens based on their interest and activities were announcing further updates to our ad system beginning in february including removing gender as an option for advertisers to reach teens additionally their engagement on our apps like following certain instagram posts or facebook pages wont inform the types of ads they see age and location will be the only information about a teen that well use to show them ads age and location help us continue to ensure teens see ads that are meant for their age and products and services available where they live giving teens more control starting in march teens will have more ways to manage the types of ads they see on facebook and instagram with ad topic controls expanding on whats already available teens will be able to go to their ad preferences within settings on both apps and choose see less or no preference to further control the types of ads they see our advertising standards already prohibit ads about restricted topics like alcohol financial products and weight loss products and services to be shown to people under 18 and older in certain countries but even when an ad complies with our policies teens may want to see fewer ads like it for example if a teen wants to see fewer ads about a genre of tv show or an upcoming sports season they should be able to tell us that teens can continue to choose to hide any or all ads from a specific advertiser the topics we already restrict in our policies will be defaulted to see less so that teens cant choose to opt into content that may not be age appropriate helping teens understand their privacy options weve added a new privacy page with more information for teens about the tools and privacy settings they can use across our technologies and our teen privacy center has additional resources to help teens understand and manage their privacy across our apps were always working on more ways to help keep teens

see offline before the competition kicks off were sharing more details about our policies against abuse and the range of tools weve developed to help keep footballers and everyone else safe our rules against abuse we have clear rules against bullying violent threats and hate speech and we dont want it on our apps as well as responding to reports from our community outside of private messages we also use technology to proactively look for content that might break these rules where our technology thinks a piece of content may be violating it will take action whether thats sending it to our teams for review or if its really confident deleting it automatically between april and june this year we took action on more than 17 million pieces of hate speech on facebook and instagram and found more than 90 of that before anyone reported it features to help keep footballers safe in response to feedback from our community weve developed new features and updated existing ones to help footballers and fans alike stay safe on our apps and protect them from abuse people can turn direct message dm requests off completely on instagram meaning they wont receive messages from anyone they dont follow they can also choose who can comment on their posts or turn off comments altogether on a post by post basis but some public figures have told us they dont want to turn off dm requests completely because they like hearing from fans and other members of their community thats why we developed hidden words when turned on this feature automatically sends dm requests including story replies containing offensive words phrases and emojis to a hidden folder so you dont have to see them it also hides comments with these terms under your posts since launching hidden words last year more than one in five people with more than 10 000 followers have turned it on were also testing turning it on by default for people with creator accounts which includes many footballers playing in the world cup we launched limits last year which when turned on hides comments and dm requests from people who dont follow you or who only followed you recently limits is particularly useful for public figures who experience sudden spikes of comments and dms after a football game for example as our research shows that most negativity towards them comes from non followers or recent followers when we detect that someone may be experiencing a rush of comments or dm requests well prompt them to turn on limits blocking is a quick and effective way to stop someone from interacting with you now when you block someone on instagram you can also block any other accounts they may already have or may create in the future making it even harder for them to contact you encouraging more supportive behavior on instagram were also continuing to explore ways to prevent people from posting abusive content in the first place we already use artificial intelligence to detect when someone is trying to post a comment that might be offensive and warn them it may break our rules in a given week people edit or delete their comment 50 of the time after seeing these warnings we also recently introduced new nudges that encourage people to pause and rethink before replying to a potentially offensive comment these nudges are live now for people whose apps are set to english portuguese spanish french chinese or arabic when people send a dm request to a creator or public figure for the first time well remind them to be respectful so they remember theres a real person on the other side of their message educating footballers about our safety tools and policies we regularly speak to football players teams and associations around the world including fifa to make sure they know about our latest safety policies and features and we listen carefully to their feedback were also working closely with teams competing in the world cup to help their players turn on our safety tools for example hidden words and were reminding footballers in the tournament to check them with a prompt at the top of their instagram feed working with law enforcement we cooperate with law enforcement in their investigations and respond to valid legal requests for information in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law as with all law enforcement requests well push back if theyre too broad inconsistent with human rights or not legally valid while we know no one thing will fix abusive behavior were committed to continuing to develop tools to protect our community and to working closely

shorts arrive on the big screen by brynn evans and melanie fitzgerald ux directors youtube nov 07 2022 copy link copy link today youtube shorts launches on tv well take a look at the design process of expanding shorts to this new surface taking a deep dive on what it takes to bring mobile first video formats to your tv screen video format not supported today youtube shorts launches on tv well take a look at the design process of expanding shorts to this new surface taking a deep dive on what it takes to bring mobile first video formats to your tv screen editor s note by neal mohan chief product officer bringing shorts to our community has transformed the way people create and watch video on youtube when we introduced this new format we optimized the experience for the mobile creator and viewer today were expanding viewing access to shorts to our fastest growing surface the tv screen while this may seem like a natural next step an incredible amount of thought and care has gone into bringing this vertical mobile first experience to the big screen in this next installment of our innovation series youll hear from two of the user experience ux design leads who made this leap a reality left before right after coming soon to a tv near you shorts starting today viewers will be able to enjoy these bright bursts of video 60 seconds or less on the big screen at home while expanding shorts to tv may seem straightforward conceptually the journey to get here was not as simple as it sounds thats why were pulling back the curtain to share a behind the scenes look at the process of bringing a vertical mobile first format to tv a look at the planning processto make this moment happen product managers engineers designers and researchers from the shorts and tv teams came together to discuss how to bring this new video format to the big screen it was important that the shorts experience on tv felt consistent with what the community sees on mobile and also natural on the bigger screen love me love me notto better understand what viewers would like from a shorts experience on tv we took an unconventional approach to our research and asked participants to write either love or breakup letters to express their feelings about short form content on tv today the love letters showed that viewers liked the community experience watching content they love easily with friends and family meanwhile the breakup letters showed that people felt it could be clunky slow to load or lacked key features like sharing here are two examples of the notes we received i was skeptical before we first met but i must admit you showed me things i didn t know i was missing the larger screen was a bigger and more comfortable viewing experience i feel you have a little way to go before youre ready for a relationship be more user friendly be easier to navigate from top to bottom option a consistent option b customized option c jukebox style making the jump from mobile to tvour research told us that there would be unique perks of watching shorts on the big screen they re easier to watch with others and the larger screen makes it a more comfortable viewing experience but the design challenge remained how could we preserve the essence of shorts with vertical videos on wide screen tvs we started by creating three very different design concepts we wanted to know if the unique feel of shorts could be conveyed in our conventional video player option a or if it should be customized to better fill the blank spaces on either side of the video option b we also considered a divergent option the jukebox style option c where multiple shorts would fill the screen at the same time taking full advantage of the tv screens additional space after another round of research feedback showed that the joy of shorts gets lost in the consistent video player option a and the jukebox style option c strayed too far from the essence of shorts which features one video at a time the customized shorts experience delivers the best of both worlds a clean design while making the most of the wide screens additional space we also learned that viewers wanted to be in the drivers seat of the viewing experience and were happy to use the remote to manually advance to the next short rather than have the feed autoplay this was unusual typically we find that level of interactivity can be tedious with a remote but in this case short form video is unique research indicated that people want to take charge of the viewing experience just like with shorts on mobile and even expected it using prototypes to bring shorts to life on tvin our final phase of design we created two high fidelity prototypes of a customized shorts video player that incorporated feedback from our latest round of research now we were trying to balance a pure viewing experience with features that people expect from shorts and youtube like comments community actions e g like subscribe and finding related videos the simple prototype included the bare minimum sidebars and basic functionality for engaging with shorts the maximal prototype gave a lot more visible functionality from related tags to comments and included a color sampled blurred background when we tested these prototypes with the community we learned that people preferred the maximal version it made better use of the tv screens additional space and the color sampled background made the experience feel more modern bringing our learnings livein the design rolling out today youll see a modified version of that maximal prototype we simplified the design of the right side rail but will be looking to bring in additional functionality in future releases we believe that this experience balances the fun quirkiness of shorts in a way that feels natural for tv video format not supported watch youtube shorts on your tv as youtube continues to make it easier to interact on tv the richness of the shorts experience will only grow bringing shorts to tv is a great bridge to bring two of our most important experiences together to benefit both creators and viewers over the coming weeks this experience will be rolling out on tv models 2019 and later and on newer game consoles we look forward to hearing your thoughts user feedback is critical to ensure we continue to build more inclusive and helpful products join

weve gone through some changes in this latest installment of our innovation series were sharing a design update that will make youtube more modern and bring new features to power the youtube you know and love youtube just celebrated its 17th birthday earlier this year and we wondered if it was time to give it a small makeover so we gathered input from thousands of viewers around the world and heard there was a desire for a cleaner more lively design that better represents what were all about video format not supported starting today we are rolling out a new look and several features that offer a more modern and immersive viewing experience while also improving how users watch videos but dont worry the same youtube you know and love is still at our core a splash of colorcolor was a key theme for us during the development phase we wanted to add vibrancy to our apps without detracting from viewers habits whether thats enjoying their recommended videos or browsing for new content after tinkering with several ideas ambient mode came to life and when the first design concept was met with overwhelmingly positive reactions from users during testing we knew we were onto something using dynamic color sampling ambient mode introduces a subtle effect so the app background color adapts to match the video we were inspired by the light that screens cast out in a darkened room and wanted to recreate the effect so viewers were drawn right into the content and the video takes an even greater focus on our watch page this feature will be available on web and mobile in dark theme and while were on the subject we heard your feedback and are excited to share that dark theme has been updated to be even darker so the colors truly pop on your screen this will roll out on web mobile and smart tvs for those who pride themselves on curating the perfect playlist we didnt forget about you video playlists will adopt the same color treatment and now show more details about each playlist so viewers can easily jump right in it all starts with videowe know that the main reason you come to youtube is well to watch your favorite content so were making improvements to bring the focus back to the video player youtube links in video descriptions will change to buttons and frequent actions such as like share and download are now formatted to minimize distraction now were making the watch page easier on the eyes youtube links in video descriptions will change to buttons and frequent actions such as like share and download are now formatted to minimize distractions the subscribe button is also getting a touch up the new shape and high contrast make it really stand out and while its no longer red it s easier to find and way more accessible to everyone on both watch pages and channel pages and were more than just our looks after introducing and testing several new product features on youtube com new earlier this year we heard from many of you wondering when wed make these more broadly available the wait ends here were launching pinch to zoom and precise seeking to all users starting today video format not supported with pinch to zoom you can now easily zoom in and out of a video while on your ios or android phone and when you let go the video stays zoomed in so you can enjoy the rest of the video in greater detail give your fingers a rest video format not supported have you ever followed along to a tutorial on your phone but needed to keep rewinding so you could master that one small step precise seeking helps solve this problem whether youre on desktop or your mobile device simply drag or swipe up while seeking to display a row of thumbnails in the video player and youll be able to make fine tuned adjustments to get to the exact part in each video more like this the future of interactivity in the living room precise seeking builds on our recent improvements to video navigation that help you quickly find the parts youre most interested in we launched the

every channel on youtube will have one we re rolling them out gradually the timing of when a creator will get access to the handles selection process depends on a number of factors including overall youtube presence subscriber count and whether the channel is active or inactive when a creator chooses their handle well also create a matching url ex youtube com handle so creators can easily direct people to their content when theyre not on youtube if a channel already has a personalized url theres no need to update links theyll automatically be redirected to the new handle based url to create a

conditions youll see a shelf showing videos of personal stories relevant to the topic we all have or will face a moment when we hear news about a difficult medical diagnosis either for ourselves or a loved one the first impulse is often to try and absorb as much information as possible to make sense of what it all means many times people arent coming to youtube with a health question at all instead they come with a human question how do i live with this we have spent a lot of time at youtube trying to better understand why people come to our platform when they have health questions some of what we found isnt surprising people visit youtube when they want to understand something complex in simple visual terms human biology is complicated and video can make it easier youtube creators are seen as down to earth messengers who explain things in an accessible way that people understand but we also saw another pattern in the data many times people arent coming to youtube with a health question at all instead they come with a human question how do i live with this people grappling with the reality of living with a health condition especially a chronic one were not looking for information they were looking for support how did other people live with this does it ever get better how do i support my loved one through this what meaning can i make of it and they were all getting at the same human element we help each other get through things the need for connection and belonging is a universal one and thats proven with data the science of peer support shows that social connectedness positively impacts both physical and mental health today were launching a new way to do just that with the introduction of our new personal stories shelf starting this week when you search for health topics and questions related to certain conditions youll see a shelf showing videos of personal stories relevant to the topic to start we are focusing on queries related to cancer

condition content that is promotional in nature is not eligible for this feature and all videos that appear in this feature must comply with our policies that prevent the spread of health misinformation this work was deeply influenced and informed by the personal experiences of all of us on the youtube health team but none more so than our colleague maya amoils during an interview on the all the wiser podcast maya shared that after her diagnosis she sought insights from people who had walked in her shoes i wanted to learn from people who had sat in the unknown and learned to live with it maya was in her late 20s when she was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer she spoke both publicly and privately about the experience of that diagnosis and the daily ins and outs of living with cancer after her diagnosis maya found herself seeking connection with other young women who were going through a similar experience she helped our youtube health team understand the need for people to have shared human experience to complement information to connect and know that youre not alone thats why in addition to her role as the mental health partnership lead maya was also our product consultant and helped guide our work to better define algorithmically identify and showcase peoples personal health stories on youtube she helped us to center the perspectives of people who were dealing with the human experience of illness through her own superpower an uncanny ability to connect easily and deeply with everyone who met her we lost our dear friend maya this past january she leaves behind a legacy of giving not only through this project but through mayas way herfoundation that supports women under age 40 who are undergoing cancer care to access integrative medicine as

ways to earn for shorts creators video format not supported the popularity of short form video has exploded on youtube with over 30b daily views and 1 5b monthly logged in users bringing an ascendant creativity across every topic vertical and region of the world to start rewarding this new creative class we launched a temporary shorts fund now we re expanding our unique business model to this new format revenue sharing is coming to shorts heres how it ll work beginning in early 2023 current and future ypp creators will be eligible for revenue sharing on shorts in shorts ads run between videos in the shorts feed so every month revenue from these ads will be added together and used to reward shorts creators and help cover costs of music licensing from the overall amount allocated to creators they will keep 45 of the revenue distributed based on their share of total shorts views the revenue share remains the same no matter if they use music or not this brand new approach allows us to reward all ypp creators who make up the shorts experience not just to those with videos running next to ads in addition since music fuels some of our most vibrant and memorable shorts it simplifies the complexities of music licensing so that creators dont have to worry about whether or not they use music in their short we expect the majority of our shorts fund recipients to earn more money under this new model which was built for long term sustainability instead of a fixed fund we re doubling down on the revenue sharing model that has supercharged the creator economy and enabled creators to benefit from the platform s success revenue sharing on shorts ads is yet another way for creators to make moneyit adds to our full suite of products which enabled us to pay creators artists and media

for their favorite shorts and creators can interact with their fans through purchased highlighted super thanks comments and were bringing together brands and shorts creators as part of youtube brandconnect evolving the soundtrack of youtube music is essential to shorts and across youtubeover the years weve seen how creators can give classics new life or bring a local hit to the global stage but the complexities of music licensing has meant that most long form videos that feature music yes even that one workout video you didnt finish dont result in the creator getting paid so in recognizing an opportunity to build a bridge between the music industry and creators on our platform were redefining how music can be featured in creator videos were introducing creator music a new destination in youtube studio that gives youtube creators easy access to an ever growing catalog of music for use in their long form videos creators can now buy affordable high quality music licenses that offer them full monetizing potentialthey will keep the same revenue share theyd usually make on videos without any music and for creators who dont want to buy a license up front theyll be able to use songs and share revenue with the tracks artist and associated rights holders creator music currently in beta in the us and expanding to more countries in 2023 will offer a streamlined process for creatorstheyll be able to instantly see the terms for their song selection we believe creator music will mean more amazing creator artist collabs more new tunes in viewers playlists and more ways for

would happen if we gave artists on reddit license to make any style of avatar they wanted and what if we could help these artists showcase their art to the entire reddit community and make it easy for them to earn money for their work our new collectible avatars storefront does just that collectible avatars in this series collectible avatars are limited edition avatars made by independent artists in partnership with reddit and provide owners with unique benefits on the reddit platform if someone sets their collectible avatar as their avatar on reddit they can mix and match the avatar gear with other reddit avatar gear and accessories and their profile image in comments sections will have a glow like effect collectible avatars differ from other avatars on reddit in a few ways they are available for purchase vs being free or available via reddit premium and artists will be paid for each collectible avatar sold collectible avatars are backed by blockchain technology giving purchasers

avatars on reddit using local currencies such as dollars in the u s as soon as someone completes a purchase theyll be able to use their avatar on reddit to store and manage collectible avatars redditors will use their vault a blockchain powered wallet on reddit a vault gives users a specific digital wallet address that works across ethereum compatible blockchains its the same vault where redditors currently store community points empowering artists on reddit many of the artists we worked with for this first series came from popular creative communities like r comics some have cultivated the skills they utilized for this program in subreddits like r procreate or r adobeillustrator we also worked with artists from our networks who are bringing their work to reddit for the first time from the start our goal has been to empower artists to create and sell their work artists will get paid for every collectible avatar that sells on reddit less any fees and are also entitled

this test to additional countries including india and brazil we plan to expand to the uk and eu before the end of the year were also removing social vouching as an option to verify age from the test to make some improvements were testing new options for people to verify their age on instagram allowing us to provide age appropriate experiences in addition to providing an id people will now be able to ask others to vouch for their age or use technology that can confirm their age based on a video selfie were partnering with yoti a company that specializes in privacy preserving ways to verify age starting today were testing new options for people on instagram to verify their age starting with people based in the us if someone attempts to edit their date of birth on instagram from under the age of 18 to 18 or over well require them to verify their age using one of three options upload their id record a video selfie or ask mutual friends to verify their age were testing this so we can make sure teens and adults are in the right experience for their age group we are also partnering with yoti a company that specializes in online age verification to help ensure peoples privacy in 2019 we began asking people to provide their age when signing up for instagram since then we ve made this a requirement knowing peoples age allows us to provide appropriate experiences to different age groups specifically teens we require people to be at least 13 years old to sign up for instagram in some countries our minimum age is higher when we know if someone is a teen 13 17 we provide them with age appropriate experiences like defaulting them into private accounts preventing unwanted contact from adults they dont know and limiting the options advertisers have to reach them with ads testing new ways to verify agein addition to having someone upload their id were testing two new ways to verify a persons age video selfie you can choose to upload a video selfie to verify your age if you choose this option youll see instructions on your screen to guide you after you take a video selfie we share the image with yoti and nothing else yotis technology estimates your age based on your facial features and shares that estimate with us meta and yoti then delete the image the technology cannot recognize your identity just your age social vouching this option allows you to ask mutual followers to confirm how old you are the person vouching must be at least 18 years old must not be vouching for anyone else at that time and will need to meet other safeguards we have in place the three people you select to vouch for you will receive a request to confirm your age and will need to respond within three days you will still be able to upload your id to verify your age with forms of identification like a drivers license or id card we will use your id to confirm your age and help keep our community safe your id will be stored securely on our servers and is deleted within 30 days we worked with international youth privacy and safety experts to inform our approach you can learn more about these three options and how to set them up here partnering with yotiwere partnering with yoti a company that offers privacy preserving ways to verify age yoti is verified by the age check certification scheme and is the leading age verification provider for several industries around the world including social media gaming and age restricted e commerce expert and governmental organizations in youth and privacy including the german regulator kjm have publicly endorsed yoti for their approach and expertise in responsible artificial intelligence ai yoti notes that it trains its dataset on anonymous images of diverse people from around the world who have transparently allowed yoti to use their data and who can ask yoti to delete their data at any time for people under the age of 13 yoti collected data using specific data collection exercises where parents or guardians have given explicit consent using ai to understand peoples agesin addition to testing the new menu of options to verify peoples ages we also use ai to understand if someone is a teen or an adult ai helps us prevent teens from accessing facebook dating adults from messaging teens and helps teens from receiving restricted ad content for example our goal is to expand the use of this technology more widely across our technologies to learn more about how our technology works and the advancements were making in artificial intelligence you can review our ai blog post our approach to privacythe information provided in each age verification option is used to confirm your age and wont be visible on your profile to friends or other people on instagram if you choose to upload a video selfie to verify your age meta and yoti delete it once your age is confirmed your video is not used for anything else other than to verify your age if you choose to upload an id after you send us a copy of your id it ll be encrypted and stored securely understanding someones age online is a complex industry wide challenge we want to work with others in our industry and with governments to set clear standards for age verification online many people such as teens dont always have access to the forms of id that make age verification clear and simple as an industry we have to explore novel ways to approach the dilemma of verifying someones age when they dont have an id we still believe an effective way of addressing this problem is for devices or app stores to provide apps with peoples ages allowing teens to be placed in age appropriate experiences across all the apps they use in the absence of industry standards or regulation on how to effectively verify age online weve invested in a combination of technologies that are more equitable provide more options to verify age and that protect the privacy of people using our

were excited to share a new feature that gives tv viewers a direct way to access the full power of youtube at their fingertips while watching on your tv editor s note by neal mohan chief product officer earlier this year we shared some highlights of the product roadmap for 2022 including how well be improving the youtube experience on your tv which was once again our fastest growing screen in 2021 in this next installment of our innovation series were giving you an inside look at how we design youtube for tvs including a new feature that brings the best of youtube to the big screen making the tv experience even better and more interactive for our viewers when the youtube app for tv screens launched 12 years ago it became a great way for our viewers to watch their favorite youtube videos on a bigger screen than their computers or mobile phones since then weve continued to improve this experience as the popularity of streaming services and watching youtube on tv has continued to grow as of january 2022 on average viewers are watching over 700 million hours of youtube content on tv daily as more people watch youtube on their tvs one challenge we face as a design team is how to keep the experience simple streamlined and intuitive but also bring the best of youtube to the tv today were excited to share a new feature that gives tv viewers a direct way to access the full power of youtube at your fingertips while watching on your tv how we design for the living roomyoutube offers a rich set of features for our global community of more than 2 billion viewers from liking or commenting to engage with a video to supporting your favorite creators by subscribing joining channel memberships or even sending a super sticker and on tv screens we want to offer this same youtube experience you know and love but this also poses a handful of design challenges our research team has spent hundreds of hours diving into users experiences with youtube on their tvs we know remote controls can be difficult to use and navigate with most tvs dont have web browsers built in and you generally have less space to work with since youre always watching video in a full screen experience over 80 of people said they use another digital device while watching tv so how do we design for an intuitive big screen experience that also incorporates the features you love about youtube early on we honed in on an interesting insight over 80 of people said they use another digital device while watching tv when we dug into this further we noticed that people were not only simultaneously opening the youtube mobile app but were also engaging with the video e g liking subscribing via their phones all while playing the same video on the tv with these insights in mind we stopped thinking about how to fit all these features into the big screen and instead pivoted to think about how the phone can be more deeply connected to the tv experience overall introducing a new way to engage with youtube on tvstarting today were rolling out a new feature that lets you effortlessly connect your tv to your ios or android phone so you can dive deeper with your favorite content on youtube while you watch on the big screen video format not supported to try this your phone and tv must be signed in to the same youtube account open the youtube app on tv then open the youtube app on your phone and click connect on the prompt that automatically pops up now your phone will be synchronized to the tv so you can directly interact with the video you are watching from the convenience of your phone that means its easier than ever to read video descriptions leave comments share the video with a friend or support your favorite creators by sending a super chat or becoming a member all while you watch on the big screen whats next for youtube on tvstheres much more to come as we think about the future of interactivity in the living room with this launch your phone becomes your all purpose

people to find and engage in communities content and conversations over the last year weve been steadily improving and updating our search experiences to support the millions of posts communities and people that make up the platform helping people find and engage in the topics that matter most to them today were announcing a number of new updates to reddits search capabilities to make our vast platform of content more easily searchable starting first with the ability to search comments with this latest update for the first time in sixteen years everything on reddit is now searchable users posts communities and now comments making reddit one of the first platforms with this capability additional new features include completely new user interfaces for search and improved search relevance comment search with this new capability users looking for particular discussions or comments on reddit no longer need to click on several posts and then scroll through what can sometimes be thousands of comments to find threads that are relevant to them the new feature solves this problem and quickly gives redditors the ability to comment search directly and further refine their searches by searching for comments within specific communities for example if someone wants to find a thread about the best locations in london previously they would have to look through each post in the r london community browsing the comments to find it now they can easily see all the different recommendations on the best places for high tea that people have shared in comments last year we surveyed users asking what they wanted to see most out of search and one of the top results was comment search in our limited initial testing we saw that more than 26 000 redditors used comment search to scan through over five billion comments new user experiences and interfaces weve also been hard at work creating a new look for the search results page on desktop and mobile showing content in a new simpler design based on user feedback we now prioritize posts over other content types in our updated search design and simplified the results page so users can more easily skim through the results and find what theyre looking for the team is also working to make search safer for all users by reducing the number of unexpected results based on the searchers intent in q1 of 2022 alone we ve seen a 20 growth increase up from q4 2021 in users utilizing the search function on reddit signaling our continued improvements are helping redditors quickly and easily find what they re looking for improved search relevance and more improving relevance in search has been another core area of focus to make search a better experience we updated our infrastructure and focused on allowing for less restrictive matching 100 of a query doesnt have to match the text of a post to return relevant results by doing this we saw a 60 increase in results for queries that previously didnt receive results for example lets say someone searches for dogecoin stonks 2021 and doesn t find what theyre looking for because there isn t an exact match with our new treatment theyre more likely to get related results and more of them than they would have before using user patterns to improve results we now have a better understanding of user intentions when they search for something on reddit for example if someone is searching for a topic that a lot of other people are searching for we ll automatically sort their results to prioritize the newest content to make sure the results are fresh incorporating signals for post results this enhancement looks at users clicks and interactions on search results as a signal of what might be valuable for them for example if 30 other people clicked on the fourth post result when they searched for succulents the next time someone else searched for succulents we are more likely to show the fourth post at the top position in results check out all

illustrations today to mark black history month were doing this in collaboration with artist and blackdesignvisionaries impact grant recipient jon key jkey13 of morcos key morcoskey key explores black intersectional identity through four design pillars blackness queerness southernness and family his approach resulted in rich instagram stories illustrations about black love and black joy design sat down with key to discuss his vision for three new black history month illustrated instagram stories stickers his redesign for instagrams us only shareblackstories and buyblack stickers and a new sticker blacklove design the audience we are trying to reach with blackdesignvisionaries is people who are curious about exploring design as a career was there a moment that made you realize that you wanted to be a designer illustrator and an artist jk so that moment happened when i was a sophomore in high school when i was a sophomore my friend was applying to scad savannah college of art design and had a little prospective thing that tells you what majors you can do i was flipping through this book and i saw graphics and i was like what is graphic design like you can do this you can go to school for this is it a thing that people do nobody had ever really explained to me that that was a career literally that moment i closed the book and ran to the art department and i was like i think i need to be here design you re very committed to black and gray can you explain a little bit about your reasoning for using black and grey to display people of color jk if you think about history and black and white photography and people holding protest signs it s not like you re seeing all of these kinds of things you re seeing one powerful community come together regardless of whether they re lighter or darker they have the same goals they want liberation they want freedom so i think about that a lot with my paintings i think a lot of these paintings are talking about liberation talking about freedom fighting for whatever youre feeling suppressed by pushing forward design as a black designer what is something that you always want to get across in your art what do you hope to get across in these instagram illustrations jk the biggest thing is the nuances and the power of what it is to be a black person and to be living and thriving breathing and celebrating building community and having family and having chosen family these illustrations are showing a little bit more of a complicated perspective of black history month and blackness it s not like this cis straight hetero thing that people get left out of if you think about gay rights in new york city these are all black trans women that were leading the way even with black lives matter these are black women and black queer women that are leading the way i m very happy that queerness is apparent and that it is being celebrated and supported design in terms of sharing black stories how do you feel about doing the entire redesign jk oh my god so that s super exciting i think it looks very cool but it s also like well how do people actually use these things i really like the typefaces that im selecting one typeface is by tre seals of vocal type vocal type which is a black type designer that s my job as a designer right it s my job as a person that gets opportunities to do things is bringing other people with me like them up and to elevate them and amplify their stories and voices as well and try to get as many people as many opportunities i think it s really super fun i think that people are gonna get it design your four core themes are blackness southerness queerness and family can you explain why it s important for your art to reflect those themes jk when i was an undergrad at risd i was really questioning what does it mean to be a graphic designer i was making work nobody was listening nobody cared i was like do i care so i started writing and i started asking myself these questions what does it mean to be a black graphic designer what does it mean to be a graphic designer from alabama what does it mean for my family to impact my graphic design work what does it mean for my queerness and really investigating what i care about what is my story i continued to write and try to visualize and contextualize this writing that i was doing as an undergrad and the themes that came pretty clear to me are these four pillars that i really care about these four pillars that really define who i am as a person so those four pillars are then translated to four colours black became blackness the color black i love that it takes up colorism i love that it is really thinking and referencing contemporary painters but also referencing arts historical painters as well our southerness became green i grew up in alabama i grew up on a farm it was bucolic it was very verdant and there were trees everywhere family became red thinking about bloodline thinking about ancestry thinking about lineage and thinking about being reborn and violet was queerness i thought about how red and blue are primary colors that are a duality that come together to make purple but in actuality violet is its own true colour it exists in the world outside of that binary i think about queerness working the same way existing outside of the binary being its own true thing when people ask me to do these types of commissions i like to use my colors i like to instill that kind of system and identity within the work im also a graphic designer so i think visual identities visual systems things having conceptual rules that make sense are a thing that i am bound to

is getting a new onboarding process and more visible notes","text":"as of november 2022 birdwatch is now community notes birdwatch is a collaborative way to add helpful context to tweets and keep people better informed as a recap the program is made up of a group of people or contributors who help identify information in tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context only notes that are rated helpful by a diverse group of contributors or that bridge across groups of people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings are made visible on twitter the program began testing in 2021 and is regularly being updated and improved thanks to analysis from our research team and feedback from our academic advisory board and birdwatch contributors now were rolling out a new onboarding process and expanding the visibility of notes to increase the positive impact of birdwatch and enable healthier twitter conversations heres a look at whats new along with some important new findings that highlight the impact birdwatch is already having on twitter we re rolling out an updated birdwatch onboarding process that better incentivizes contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way new birdwatch contributors who have met the eligibility criteria will begin with an initial rating impact score of zero which they can increase by consistently rating other contributors notes and reliably identifying those that are helpful and not helpful once a contributors score has risen to five they can start writing notes contributors can further increase their writing and rating impact scores by both writing helpful notes and continuing to rate notes written by others repeatedly writing notes that reach a status of not helpful however will result in a decreasing score and could temporarily lock a contributors note writing ability birdwatch contributors must have a verified phone number from a trusted us based carrier no recent twitter rules violations and a minimum six months on twitter with the new onboarding process in place were ready to begin expanding our contributor base well start by adding larger groups of eligible applicants to the pilot on a more frequent basis the process will be adjusted as needed as we closely monitor whether this change has any impact on either the quality or the frequency of contributions the visibility of notes on public tweets will also be increasing in the coming weeks more people using twitter in the us will start to see notes on tweets that birdwatch contributors have collectively identified as helpful importantly this doesnt mean youll start seeing notes on every tweet simply that a larger number of you will start seeing notes that have been rated helpful our research indicates that birdwatch is an effective way to keep people better informed on twitter according to the results of three surveys people who see a birdwatch note are on average 20 40 less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading tweet than someone who sees the tweet alone by analyzing our internal data we also estimate that people on twitter who see notes are on average 15 35 less likely to like or retweet a tweet than someone who sees the tweet alone notes are intentionally designed to be as informative and helpful as possible no matter who sees them thanks in large part to the bridging algorithm we mentioned above heres how it works in order to be shown on a tweet birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings this means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as helpful or not helpful but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives this approach appears to be having an impact in our most recent survey notes were found to be informative regardless of a person s self identified political party affiliation there was no

publicly available along with the code that uses that data to rank notes and we continue to do so feedback and insights from the twitter community has led to key improvements to birdwatch strengthening the way birdwatch identifies notes that a diverse set of people find helpful doing more to protect contributors and help them feel more comfortable contributing to birdwatch by rolling out auto generated aliases for everyone in the pilot helping participants understand the impact of their birdwatch contributions by notifying them if their notes are rated helpful or if notes they rated are elevated encouraging participants to include sources and clear explanations in their notes with in app prompt reminders improving the discoverability of notes that need a broader range of

beginning of 2021 and what truly excites me is the positive and uplifting community that has grown around my content i love to create educational but personal content with the main through line being positivity transparency and authenticity on fashion lifestyle and beauty i love my supporters so much and my goal is always to create content that excites both of us and sparks conversations what are the stories you re telling on tiktok i weave the stories of my life and what has led me to where i am into every video but overall i want to break down walls and pop bubbles in the world of luxury

it has been an incredible journey i originally started creating tiktok videos for my kids and family but since i had such an incredible response i began to share more and more for everyone to enjoy with the pandemic in full swing the future was so unclear so just in case something happened to me my kids would have all their favorite recipes to refer to on video with a step by step tutorial on how to prepare each recipe on creating longer videos i do have to say that when they announced longer videos i was beyond excited with longer videos i could take my time to better explain each recipe my original goal was to leave these videos for my kids and grandkids but now i want to take this to the next level and create a name for myself why ana loves making content my content is definitely educational in creating simple and delicious recipes for all food lovers the phrase if you do something you love you will never have to work a day in your life which is what i am doing now andrew

a virtual gameshow black brilliance game show andrew s informative longform content teaches fosters awareness around important topics and inspires an ever growing audience on tiktok what excites you most about creating on tiktok educating people about black brilliant people in american history and the community you build is awesome what are the stories you re telling on tiktok most of my videos are sharing brilliant black people in american history inventors scientists actors dancers business people freedom fighters historic activists and so on why do you make videos on tiktok one to educate and inspire black people about the brilliance they have contributed to the world and it has been a pleasant surprise that other races and cultures have been excited about black brilliance two to

time to share those stories franks videos are filled with all the more information background and detail that audiences look for and enjoy on frank s tiktok journey i ve been creating on tiktok since april of 2020 what excites me most is the fashion in which tiktok rewards quality video it s what allowed me to grow in the first place how would you describe your content i prefer the words video or art instead of content i don t take offense to it but storytelling is an art form i describe my work as high quality entertaining informative and digestible on creating longer videos i started publishing longer videos as soon as the feature became available oftentimes when i edit the video comes out to anywhere between 60 and 70 seconds rather than subtracting key scenes longer videos affords me the ability to tell my stories in full my longer videos perform just as well if not better than my other videos if i had to guess i d say most of the time my audience doesn t even notice they re longer which is what we re going for now that we ve seen a little of what s possible when creators have time to experiment with longer content we re encouraging creators around the world to try new things with content that would benefit from some more time on the clock we continue to be inspired by creators who have perfected the art of longer content and we re excited to see all the

acknowledge there is a certain magic in just sitting down with someone in person sharing your thoughts in confidence knowing you are both connecting in private and in that moment the freedom to be honest and vulnerable knowing that conversation isnt being recorded and stored somewhere forever deciding how long a message lasts should be in your hands weve become accustomed to leaving a digital copy of just about everything we type without even thinking about it its become the equivalent of a note taker following us around making a permanent record of everything weve said this is why we introduced disappearing messages last year and more recently a way for photos and videos to immediately disappear after being viewed once today we are excited to provide our users with more options to control their messages and how long they stick around with default disappearing messages and multiple durations whatsapp users will now have the option to turn on disappearing messages by default for all new chats when enabled all new one on one chats you or another person start will be set to disappear at your chosen duration and we ve added a new option when creating a group chat that lets you turn it on for groups you create this new feature is optional and does not change or delete any of your existing chats we are also adding two new durations for disappearing messages 24 hours and 90 days as well as the existing option of 7 days for people who choose to switch on default disappearing messages we will display a message in your chats that tells people this is the default youve chosen this makes clear it s nothing personal it s a choice you ve made about how you want to communicate with everyone on whatsapp moving forward though of course if you need a particular conversation to remain permanent its easy to switch a chat back living apart from family and friends for over a year has made it clearer than ever that just because we cant physically talk in person it doesnt mean we should have to sacrifice the privacy of our personal conversations we believe disappearing messages along with end to end encryption are two crucial features that define what it means to be a private messaging service today and bring us one step closer to the feeling of an in personal conversation to get started go to your privacy settings and select default message timer you

youtube by james beser director of product management youtube youth oct 25 2021 copy link copy link an overview of the approach we take in protecting kids and families on youtube an overview of the approach we take in protecting kids and families on youtube when i tell people that i work at youtube i often hear stories about how their families come to youtube to learn something new do yoga draw and cook together as kids and teens spend more time online its important to protect their experience while encouraging exploration responsibility is our number one priority at youtube and nothing is more important than protecting kids for our younger users weve built a dedicated kids destination the youtube kids app weve invested heavily over the years to make youtube kids a safer family friendly place for kids to explore their imagination and curiosity we have a higher bar for which videos can be a part of the app and also empower parents to control what content their child can and cannot see but we also give parents options on the main youtube experience including the ability to create a supervised account for their tween or watch together with their kids today we wanted to give you an overview of the approach we take in protecting kids and families on youtube this work builds on the framework we use across youtube to live up to our responsibility as an open platform while protecting the youtube community our principles are organized around the four rs remove harmful content raise authoritative voices reduce borderline content and reward trusted creators we apply these pillars across a range of content from elections to misinformation and they also ground our efforts to protect kids and families this work complements our existing safety and digital wellbeing options and privacy and data practices for childrens content heres how removewe have clear policies that prohibit content that exploits or endangers minors on youtube and have committed significant time and resources toward removing violative content as quickly as possible we also regularly review these policies and engage with external experts to ensure they are current for example weve updated our policy to cover content meant to target young minors and families that contains sexual themes violence obscenity or other mature themes in q2 of 2021 alone we removed over 1 8 million videos for violations of our child safety policies youtube kids is a separate app that is a filtered version of youtube has specific content policies and a much smaller set of channels and videos available over the years weve raised the bar for which channels and videos can be a part of youtube kids drastically reducing the number of channels on the app for example weve recently updated our policies to remove overly commercial content from youtube kids such as videos that only focus on product packaging or directly encourage children to spend money raise reduceover the last few years weve been working to implement products and policies that help us connect families with high quality content on youtube and youtube kids in collaboration with child development specialists we established a set of quality principles to help guide our kids and family creator ecosystem age appropriate enriching and engaging content can come in different formats genres and cover a range of topics they include videos that inspire curiosity and imagination celebrate diverse perspectives and encourage kids to uncover their own interests and passions these principles help determine inclusion in youtube kids and how recommendations work in the main youtube experience on youtube kids we identify and include videos and channels that are age appropriate and adhere to the quality principles we also use these principles to determine which high quality content we raise up in our recommendations on youtube this means that when youre watching made for kids content on youtube we aim to recommend videos that are age appropriate educational and inspire creativity and imagination for example if you were watching scishow kids how do rockets fly we could recommend content like art for kids hubs how to draw a rocket super semas how to make a diy cd hovercraft or goldieblox s stem curiosity camp at the same time we use these principles to reduce kids content that is low quality but doesnt violate our community guidelines in our recommendations on youtube and remove channels from youtube kids examples of this content include videos that are heavily commercial or promotional encourage negative behaviors or attitudes and more our work here is ongoing and we regularly reevaluate and update these principles you can read more here rewardthere is a vibrant community of kids and family content creators that produce high quality content and we want to make sure that were rewarding these creators and helping them grow and succeed on youtube we set a higher bar for what channels can make money on youtube in addition to our community guidelines creators also need to follow our monetization policies to join the youtube partner program every channel applying to ypp undergoes review by a trained rater to make sure it meets our policies and we continually keep these guidelines current we also regularly review and remove channels that dont comply with our policies earlier this month we shared additional monetization policieswhich align with the quality principles discussed abovefor channels that primarily create kids and family content on youtube going forward these principles will have not only an impact on recommendations and inclusion in youtube kids but also on monetization channels that primarily target young audiences or are classified as made for kids will need to deliver high quality content and comply with kids specific monetization policies for example channels that have predominantly low quality kids content such as heavily commercial or promotional or encouraging negative behaviors or attitudes may be suspended from ypp and if an individual video violates these quality principles it may see limited or no ads we have reached out to potentially impacted creators in order to support them before these changes take effect starting next month our ultimate goal is to foster a safe and enriching environment for families while rewarding trusted creators who are making high quality kids and family content we are proud of the incredible creators who are delivering enriching and diverse content for people across the globe were committed to helping them succeed

searches more visualpeople told us that theyd like easier ways to see what a video is about on youtube before diving into the actual content we heard you thats why weve started to make our search page even more visual to help people get a better glimpse of whats inside a video up until now when you browsed for a video to watch on youtube youd see a thumbnail image of each video it gave you a chance to gather a quick snapshot of the videos content now youll be able to make even more informed decisions about what youre going to watch through video chapters directly in the search page when available these time stamped images detail the different topics covered in videos and let you better evaluate the video youre about to watch you can also jump directly to the section most relevant to your specific interest let s say you re looking for a good sourdough recipe and want to work on your kneading technique with these new search results you can see all the steps in the video from feeding the starter to pulling the bread out of the oven and skip right to the chapter on kneading video format not supported getting a chance to see a snippet of each video can also bring a lot of helpful context on desktop you can already scroll over a video and begin to see a snippet of the content on the search page were rolling a version of this out to mobile to help you easily preview different videos and decide if its what youre looking for making more content available to everyonewhile youtube has a lot of videos they dont always cover every topic across every language and were always looking for new ways to make information more accessible and inclusive for all users globally we now have some exciting approaches to improve content searches across the globe on youtube were starting to show search results from other languages with automatically translated captions titles and descriptions when relevant content in the local language isnt available this means that someone in thailand can learn about quantum physics from a professor at mit or viewers in brazil can explore the grand canyon from home with captions in their local language well start supplementing search results with english videos and plan to expand to more languages our hope is that all global content will become more accessible through translated captions and help creators reach a more global audience we also recognize that not all searches may have enough high quality or relevant video content to fully address what youre looking for to better surface information you need weve recently started experimenting with a new feature to complement search results with website links and other formats from google search its currently available on mobile devices in india and indonesia but well consider expanding to additional countries based on user feedback from discovering a video that deepens your understanding of a complex topic or inspires you to kick start a new hobby we want to help you search for the right content on youtube well continue to find ways to make that search experience even more intuitive and helpful in the future related topics products and

verification and what’s next","text":"were excited to share that starting today we ll begin rolling out our new verification application process and reviewing public applications for verification on twitter over the past several months we ve been working to bring clarity to the verification eligibility criteria and launched a new policy shaped by public feedback we also started enforcing that policy by automatically removing the verified badge from accounts that no longer meet the updated criteria for verification such as those that are inactive or incomplete were grateful for all who participated in our public feedback period and shared ideas for how we can improve verification on twitter todays application rollout marks the next milestone in our plans to give more transparency credibility and clarity to verification on twitter below we share more about this application process and whats next in our work to help people understand who theyre interacting with on twitter what it means to be verified on twitter the blue badge is one of the ways we help people distinguish the authenticity of accounts that are of high public interest it gives people on twitter more context about who theyre having conversations with so they can determine if its trustworthy which our research has shown leads to healthier more informed conversations with todays application launch were also introducing new guidelines for verified accounts on twitter these verification guidelines are intended to encourage healthy conversations for the betterment of the twitter community overall they follow the philosophy to lead by example tweet others how they want to be tweeted and serve the public conversation authentically respectfully and with consideration as always all accounts including verified accounts must follow the twitter rules and as we previously shared verified accounts that repeatedly violate the twitter rules are subject to have the blue badge removed whos eligible to qualify for verification you must fit the criteria of one of the six categories listed below government companies brands and organizations news organizations and journalists entertainment sports and gaming activists organizers and other influential individuals in addition to the category specific eligibility criteria outlined in our verification policy your account must be complete meaning you have a profile name a profile image and either a confirmed email address or phone number your account must also be active within the last six months and have a record of adherence to the twitter rules you can read more about ineligible accounts in the policy as well how can you apply to get verified over the next few weeks everyone on twitter will start to see the new verification application directly in the account settings tab if you dont see this update immediately today dont worry we re gradually rolling it out to everyone to ensure that we can review applications in a timely manner heres what the application flow will look like once you submit your application you can expect an emailed response from us within a few days but this could take up to a few weeks depending on how many open applications are in our queue if your application is approved youll see the blue badge automatically on your profile if you think we made a mistake reapply 30 days after receiving our decision on your application whats next we know that the current verification policy may not represent all of the people who should be eligible to be verified on twitter so were planning to introduce more categories later this year such as those for scientists academics and religious leaders to stay up to date with verification be sure to follow verified were also excited to continue expanding the ways people can express themselves on twitter through their profile and launching new account types since our last update weve been doing ongoing research on automated accounts and plan to introduce a way to denote this account type in the next few months with memorialized accounts to follow were also exploring improvements to the twitter profile to allow people to better express themselves such as through an about page well share more on all of this soon we look forward to continuing our work to give people more ways to identify and express themselves on twitter to lead to more informed healthier

communities on facebook facebook neighborhoods is a dedicated space within the facebook app designed to help you connect with your neighbors participate in your local community and discover new places nearby people have always used facebook to connect with their neighbors rallying to support local businesses asking for recommendations and tips in local groups offering support or meeting neighbors who share common interests throughout the pandemic and especially in the past year weve seen just how crucial these connections can be facebook neighborhoods makes it easier to do this bringing the local experience across facebook into one place how it works facebook neighborhoods is a section of the facebook app dedicated to your neighborhood with a neighborhoods profile thats different from your main facebook profile to join youll need to be 18 years or older and confirm your neighborhood you can choose to join just your own neighborhood or in addition you also have the option to join your nearby neighborhoods to see neighbors and posts from your surrounding neighborhoods meet and connect with your neighbors when you create your neighborhoods profile you can choose to add interests favorite places and a bio so people can get to know you within the neighborhoods directory you can write a post to introduce yourself participate in discussions on posts from fellow neighbors and answer neighborhoods questions in the dedicated feed people can also take on roles within neighborhoods including socializers who spark friendly conversations engage with local groups you can find vibrant local facebook groups about your area or you can create your own neighborhoods bounded groups based on your interests admins of local facebook groups can add their group into neighborhoods to make it easy for people living nearby to find it and people using neighborhoods can create or join neighborhoods bounded groups that are accessible within the neighborhoods experience you can create neighborhoods groups for local bird watchers or discuss last nights game with fellow basketball lovers in your area discover new places and get local recommendations if youre looking for advice on where to get the best coffee or a locksmith in the area you can use the recommendations feature in neighborhoods to get suggestions from your local community also the neighborhoods favorite polls allow neighbors to vote on their favorite places and businesses in the area including restaurants parks and more moderation and safety we built neighborhoods to be safe and inclusive with neighborhoods guidelines to help keep interactions among neighbors relevant and kind neighborhoods have moderators who use these guidelines to review posts and comments in the neighborhoods feed if a post or comment appears to go against the neighborhoods guidelines moderators can take action by hiding the post which will then be reviewed by facebook community operations if the post violates facebook community standards the post will be removed from neighborhoods you can also report a post or comment to a neighborhoods moderator or via facebooks reporting tool if you believe it doesnt follow the guidelines or facebooks community standards you can block someone on facebook or neighborhoods and we wont inform them when someone youve blocked is logged into facebook they wont be able to find you in the neighborhoods directory privacy neighborhoods is an opt in experience within the facebook app so you choose whether to join neighborhoods and create a profile once you join neighborhoods you can decide whether to join just your neighborhood or also your nearby neighborhoods your neighborhoods profile includes your name profile and cover photo from your facebook profile and the name of your neighborhood you can also add optional information to your profile such as a bio when you join your own neighborhood these neighbors will be able to see your posts and neighborhoods profile including the name of your neighborhood if you decide to join your nearby neighborhoods as well these additional neighbors will also see this information when you create a group in neighborhoods it can be private or open and visible or hidden if your neighborhood group is private only members of the group who have joined the neighborhood can see posts if the group is open anyone in the neighborhood or nearby neighborhoods if nearby neighborhoods is selected can see whos in the group and what they post if the group is visible anyone in the neighborhood can search for and find this group if the group is hidden only members can find the group your activity and information in neighborhoods may be used to personalize your experience across facebook products including

say things in the moment they might regret later thats why in 2020 we tested prompts that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially harmful or offensive reply before they hit send based on feedback and learnings from those tests weve made improvements to the systems that decide when and how these reminders are sent starting today were rolling these improved prompts out across ios and android starting with accounts that have enabled english language settings how we got here we began testing prompts last year that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially harmful or offensive reply such as insults strong language or hateful remarks before tweeting it once prompted people had an opportunity to take a moment and make edits delete or send the reply as is in early tests people were sometimes prompted unnecessarily because the algorithms powering the prompts struggled to capture the nuance in many conversations and often didn t differentiate between potentially offensive language sarcasm and friendly banter throughout the experiment process we analyzed results collected feedback from the public and worked to address our errors including detection inconsistencies these tests ultimately resulted in people sending less potentially offensive replies across the service and improved behavior on twitter we learned that if prompted 34 of people revised their initial reply or decided to not send their reply at all after being prompted once people composed on average 11 fewer offensive replies in the future if prompted people were less likely to receive offensive and harmful replies back since the early tests heres what weve incorporated into the systems that decide when and how to send these reminders consideration of the nature of the relationship between the author and replier including how often they interact for example if two accounts follow and reply to each other often theres a higher likelihood that they have a better understanding of preferred tone of communication adjustments to our technology to better account for situations in which language may be reclaimed by underrepresented communities and used in non harmful ways improvement to our technology to more accurately detect strong language including profanity created an easier way for people to let us know if they found the prompt helpful or relevant whats next well continue to explore how prompts such as reply prompts and article prompts and other forms of intervention can encourage healthier conversations on twitter our teams will also collect feedback from people on twitter who have received reply prompts as we expand this feature to other languages stay tuned for more updates as we continue to learn and make new improvements to encourage

we want to share where we are on our journey to make this feature more accessible the spaces team has been working in the open in full view of the world since december 2020 the ongoing conversation around spaces accessibility both internally and on twitter has helped us identify and address accessibility gaps in the product by working in the open were showing you our ideas our works in progress and areas for improvement twitter is becoming a more accessible company and product in real time folks who are deaf hard of hearing hoh or prefer the support of captioning for audio will be able to turn on captions and follow along with conversations every element in spaces has an accessible label so people using assistive technology will know what every button does and what actions are available captions are incredibly important for spaces so were going to make them as accurate and versatile as possible here are some of the things well be working on first improve accuracy and synchronization of captions with audio provide scrollback and enable pausing improve support for multiple speakers speaking synchronously customization of captions appearance e g font color size background etc remove the requirement for the speaker to enable captions on ios theyre automatic on android because of the difference in caption service provider explore ways to improve automatic captioning algorithm and minimize inaccuracies explore options for increased language support match accessibility system settings larger fonts display etc present emoji reactions via assistive

improvements based on your feedback today were bringing the ability to host a space to all accounts with 600 or more followers on twitter based on what weve learned so far these accounts are likely to have a good experience hosting live conversations because of their existing audience before bringing the ability to create a space to everyone were focused on learning more making it easier to discover spaces and helping people enjoy them with a great audience people already come to twitter to talk about whats happening youve always followed people for their tweets now spaces lets you hear their voices and talk about whats happening now and whats most important to you live from tweeting to talking reading to listening spaces encourages and unlocks real open conversations on twitter with the authenticity and nuance depth and power only the human voice can bring spaces are for small and intimate conversations with just a few others or for big discussions about whats unfolding right now with thousands of listeners from connecting to your favorite musician to a post show about the game or a recap of news that just dropped dig into the topics and conversations you care about with people you know and people you want to know so how do you join or create a space glad you asked how spaces work on twitter for ios and android when someone you follow starts or speaks in a space itll appear at the top of your timeline as a purple bubble for as long as its live when you join a space as a listener you can react to what you hear with emojis check out any pinned tweets follow along with captions tweet or dm the space or request to speak when you join a space as a speaker in addition to talking you can pin tweets to the space turn on captions so everyone can follow along with what youre saying and tweet the space so your followers can join when you create a space youre in control whos speaking the topics and the vibe invite people to join by tweeting or dming them to jump in and then invite them to speak directly from your space from there talk about whatever is happening in your world its important to us that people feel safe hosting and participating in spaces conversations thats why weve built in safety controls available to hosts and speakers for example as a host you can mute speakers and take away their mic or remove them from the space completely recently we added the ability for hosts to mute all speakers at the same time and a new management page for easier hosting anyone can report and block others in the space or report the space also people youve blocked cant join a space youre hosting and youll see labels and warnings if someone youve blocked is speaking in a space you join you can learn more about how spaces work here your feedback whats next your feedback has been key in helping us build and improve spaces over the past several months weve been testing and building in the open with you via twitterspaces because were interested in incorporating your feedback early and often for example you told us you wanted more audience management controls so we built them you told us you wanted a way to show you are laughing during a space so we added an emoji heres more of whats coming based on your feedback ticketed spaces hosts put time and effort into creating space for conversation connection and fun now we re working on a way for hosts to be rewarded for the experiences they create by getting monetary support while providing listeners with exclusive access to the conversations they care about most hosts can set ticket prices and how many are available to sell a limited group will be able to host ticketed spaces in the coming months hosts earn the majority of the revenue from ticket sales and twitter will keep a small amount as well schedule and set reminders to make it easy to track whats happening and when youll also be able to schedule and set reminders for upcoming spaces in the coming weeks this way people dont miss hearing from their faves host with others co hosting with other people to help manage speakers participants and if you need to leave to pass hosting to one of your co hosts better accessibility improvements to live captions so they can be paused customized and are more accurate more about our work to make spaces accessible for everyone here more ways to find spaces more ways to find and drop into spaces across twitter join a space from a purple bubble around someones profile picture in your home timeline when theyre live were testing this now spaces is where live audio conversations happen and its just getting started listen up stay tuned and let us know what you think twitterspaces we like how its shaping up but there is much more to

News"],"title":"Incorporating More Feedback Into News Feed Ranking","text":"our goal with news feed is to arrange the posts from friends groups and pages you follow to show you what matters most to you at the top of your feed our algorithm uses thousands of signals to rank posts for your news feed with this goal in mind this spring were expanding on our work to use direct feedback from people who use facebook to understand the content people find most valuable and well continue to incorporate this feedback into our news feed ranking process expanding on worth your time surveys in 2019 we introduced surveys to ask people is this post worth your time and we use that feedback to inform how we arrange posts in their news feed going forward for example if people say a post is worth their time well aim to show posts like that higher in news feed and if it isnt worth their time well aim to show posts like that closer to the bottom we also use surveys to better understand how meaningful different friends pages and groups are to people and ranking algorithms are updated based on the responses while a posts engagement or how often people like it comment on it or share it can be a helpful indicator that its interesting to people this survey driven approach which largely occurs outside the immediate reaction to a post gives a more complete picture of the types of posts people find most valuable and what kind of content detracts from their news feed experience now were building on these surveys by asking new questions about the content people find valuable as well as the content people dont enjoy seeing in their news feed exploring more feedback driven signals over the next few months well test new ways to get more specific feedback from people about the posts theyre seeing and well use that feedback to make news feed better here are some of the new approaches were exploring whether people find a post inspirational people have told us they want to see more inspiring and uplifting content in news feed because it motivates them and can be useful to them outside of facebook for example a post featuring a quote about community can inspire someone to spend more time volunteering or a photo of a national park can inspire someone to spend more time in nature to this end were running a series of global tests that will survey people to understand which posts they find inspirational well incorporate their responses as a signal in news feed ranking with the goal of showing people more inspirational posts closer to the top of their news feed gauging interest in certain topics even though your news feed contains posts from the friends groups and pages youve chosen to follow we know sometimes even your closest friends and family share posts about topics that arent really interesting to you or that you dont want to see to address this well ask people whether they want to see more or fewer posts about a certain topic such as cooking sports or politics and based on their collective feedback well aim to show people more content about the topics theyre more interested in and show them fewer posts about topics they dont want to see better understanding content people want to see less of increasingly were hearing feedback from people that theyre seeing too much content about politics and too many other kinds of posts and comments that detract from their news feed experience this is a sensitive area so over the next few months well work to better understand what kinds of content are linked with these negative experiences for example well look at posts with lots of angry reactions and ask people what kinds of posts they may want to see less of making it easier to give feedback directly on a post weve long given people the ability to hide a particular post they encounter in news feed and well soon test a new post design to make this option even more prominent if you come across something that you find irrelevant problematic or irritating you can tap the x in the upper right corner of the post to hide it from your news feed and see fewer posts like it in the future updated on september 13 2021 at 2 30pm pt weve now fully launched the hide and see less of x overall we hope to show people more content they want to see and find valuable and less of what they dont while engagement will continue to be one of many types of signals we use to rank posts in news feed we believe these additional insights can provide a more complete picture of the content people find valuable and well share more as we learn from these tests"},{"id":"b84131a7-4996-4964-b5fc-7fbb71c0306c","platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/","date":"2021-04-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product

world at large speech sound and language are the building blocks for how we connect with each other thats why good audio experiences can feel immersive and intimate at the same time they make you feel like youre right there in the room with your friends and family sitting around at the dining table even if youre miles apart audio seamlessly fits within our busy lives allows us to be inspired by new ideas and talk with other like minded people without pressure you can share your personal story or join in on a global conversation in any way anytime anywhere even on a bad hair day without any makeup or in your car or on a run at facebook weve seen the continuing rise of audio on our platforms from audio calls to audio messages on whatsapp and messenger were working to make audio messages easier to record and more fun including the ability for people to send familiar sound clips to their friends that range from sound effects like crickets chirping to quotes from popular songs but we know there are more social experiences to create to help people say what they want to say discover new voices they havent heard before or exchange ideas at the speed of sound right now its still too difficult for most people to do any of this the best audio creation tools are reserved for the pros its still too hard to discover and share awesome audio content and too cumbersome to assemble the right group of people to have a conversation about your favorite topic at the right time at facebook weve invested in the full spectrum of audio technologies to solve these problems from audio quality enhancements captions speech translations and superhuman hearing our goal is to make audio presence easy natural and immersive so you can more fully experience social presence whether its an in depth conversation or your passing thoughts we are building audio tools and formats that connect people with the things they care about a sound studio in your pocket the first thing were building is a set of new audio creation tools just like we did for photos and videos we want everyone to have tools that are powerful enough for the pros but intuitive and fun like having a sound studio in your pocket weve been investing in audio technologies such as speech to text and voice morphing for a long time and will make them available in an audio creation tool directly inside the facebook app through our advances in ai we can make audio quality magically great even if you record on a busy street corner you will be able to use music from facebooks sound collection in the background of your story to set the tone and with the ability to mix audio tracks a growing collection of sound effects voice effects and filters it should be a lot of fun too soundbites a new social audio format these audio creation tools will enable you to create soundbites short form creative audio clips for capturing anecdotes jokes moments of inspiration poems and many other things we havent yet imagined well start testing soundbites over the next few months with a small number of creators and refine the product with their input before making it available to everyone to start were collaborating with creators to experiment with different concepts imagine comedian drew lynch sharing his short rants and food reviews in asmr lolo spencer an accessibility advocate reciting daily affirmations and her favorite inspirational quotes tobe nwigwe a visionary and entrepreneur sharing his convos with tobe about fatherhood and being a first generation nigerian american molly burke a motivational speaker who is blind recording empowering stories about overcoming adversity and josh sundquist an author and comedian using voice effects to augment his impersonations and storytelling the possibilities are endless and we cant wait to hear their soundbites podcasts are coming to facebook while were big believers in the power of short form audio we also know that some stories and conversations deserve more airtime more than 170 million people are already connected to hundreds of thousands of podcast pages on facebook and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around podcasts but until now you had to leave the facebook app to listen to these episodes within the next few months youll be able to listen to podcasts directly on the facebook app both while using the app or when the app is backgrounded and because its still hard to discover podcasts you like we will help you easily find new podcasts and episodes based on your interests comment on them and recommend them to your friends and podcast creators will be able to reach and connect with new listeners all directly within the facebook app live audio rooms in facebook and messenger were also going to start testing live audio rooms and we expect it to be available to everyone on the facebook app by the summer we believe that audio is a perfect way for communities to engage around topics they care about well test live audio rooms in groups making it available to the 1 8 billion people using groups every month and the tens of millions of active communities on facebook whether its filipino cooking group run by a former cooking reality tv show contestant the world wanderlust bucket list group filled with travelers looking for the road less traveled or octonation the largest octopus fan club of 47 000 cephalopod enthusiasts we hope that unlocking audio will be as inspiring and fun as groups already are as part of this initial rollout and because we know communities arent built just in groups well also bring live audio rooms to public figures so they can host conversations with other public figures experts and fans were making live audio both accessible and discoverable so that public figures like american football quarterback russell wilson grammy nominated electronic music artist tokimonsta artist and director elle moxley and five time olympic medalist and entrepreneur nastia liukin can share ideas with new audiences and create a forum for discussion without the added pressure of being on camera in addition to bringing this to facebook we also plan to release live audio rooms on messenger this summer so you can easily hang out with your friends too everything is being built to work together and be accessible to all we think a lot of magic happens at the intersection of audio formats as well as at the confluence of text audio and video for example with live audio creators will be able to turn a live conversation into a podcast for everyone to listen to later we also want to give creators and fans tools to share the best excerpts from a live audio or podcast and publish them as soundbites to encourage more discussion additionally were going to offer captions on all these audio experiences to make them accessible to all and if you have the sound off or prefer to follow along with text you will be able to access this universe of content on your terms similarly if youre on the go we will also make it easy to listen to most videos in the background over time all these different formats will live in a central listening destination on facebook where people can find new things and new people to listen to monetization opportunities the only way this all works long term is if creators can make money from their efforts so at launch were introducing multiple ways for audio creators to build their business while pursuing their passion when live audio rooms launch fans will be able to support their favorite creators and public figures through stars or donate to causes they care about soon after launch well also offer other monetization models like the ability to charge for access to a live audio room through a single purchase or a subscription finally to kickstart soundbites were introducing an audio creator fund to support emerging audio creators and get early feedback on the new product experience weve seen time and again just how much creative energy is liberated when you build powerful creation and editing tools make them free and easy to use and with appropriate safety and privacy safeguards put them out into the world by bringing the magic to new

news feed about registering to vote and voting by mail ahead of each states deadlines were tailoring covid 19 vaccine notifications to coincide with each state opening their eligibility to all adults so we dont promote vaccines before everyone is eligible we are ultimately rolling out these notifications nationally across the us and globally as more countries expand vaccinations sharing state vaccine information in news feed as part of our work to help people get vaccinated were working with state health departments to connect people with reliable information about whether and when theyre eligible to get a covid 19 vaccine in their state from january through march over 3 million people in the us clicked through our news feed promotions and our covid 19 information center to visit their state health website or local provider and showing people this information right in their news feed is having a positive impact on vaccine registrations for example west virginias department of health and human resources reported that their vaccine registrations increased significantly after facebook started running these notifications were also running these news feed notifications in nearly 20 countries with more following soon these notifications link to the countrys ministry of health website for more information about the vaccines and booking an appointment since february in the us weve shown people ages 65 and older a notification in news feed that links to their state website to see who can get a vaccine and how to make an appointment now that states are expanding vaccine eligibility were starting to show notifications to all eligible adults with the latest information when a state says the general public is eligible for a covid 19 vaccine well show a notification to people in that state that connects them with their state health department or our vaccine finder were already doing this in states such as alaska mississippi texas and utah our strategy to work closely with state governments is critical in order to ensure that our features are directing people to local resources as they are available and not drive demand too soon that would overwhelm systems

were running these news feed notifications in 50 us states the district of columbia and five us territories in english spanish mandarin and vietnamese this information including links to state health departments is also available in the covid 19 information center crowdtangle partnerships with health departments over the last month weve given state health departments access to crowdtangle to help address localized vaccine misinformation in a given state or region crowdtangle is a facebook tool that tracks how content spreads online when health departments flag potential vaccine misinformation on facebook and instagram we review and remove this content if it violates our policies against false covid 19 and vaccine claims this is similar to how governments and fact checkers use crowdtangle ahead of elections to identify potential voter suppression expanded access to facebook local alerts over the past year local governments have been using local alerts a tool that helps first responders and local governments communicate urgent information to their community on facebook to share covid 19 updates to help reach people quickly with vaccine information we expanded access to local alerts to even more municipal governments state and local emergency response organizations and public health agencies these groups now have the ability to push out timely credible covid 19 and vaccine

& Security","Product News","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Changes to Keep Facebook Groups Safe","text":"update on october 20 2021 at 9 00am pt today were announcing new measures to keep facebook groups safe to continue limiting the reach of people who break our rules well start demoting all groups content from members who have broken our community standards anywhere on facebook these demotions will get more severe as they accrue more violations this measure will help reduce the ability of members who break our rules from reaching others in their communities and builds on the existing restrictions placed upon members who violate community standards these current penalties include restricting their ability to post comment add new members to a group or create new groups we also want to make sure that our enforcement is transparent and fair thats why were announcing flagged by facebook this feature shows admins content that has been flagged for removal before it is shown to the broader community admins can then either review and remove the content themselves or ask for a review by facebook and provide additional feedback on why they think that piece of content should remain on the platform flagged by facebook involves admins in content review earlier in the process before members receive a strike and content is removed flagged by facebook is in addition to the existing ability for admins to appeal when something is taken down for violating our community standards this provides more fairness for communities and helps ensure that the right call is being made when it comes to enforcing our policies originally published on march 17 2021 at 8 00am pt its important to us that people can discover and engage safely with facebook groups so that they can connect with others around shared interests and life experiences thats why weve taken action to curb the spread of harmful content like hate speech and misinformation and made it harder for certain groups to operate or be discovered whether theyre public or private when a group repeatedly breaks our rules we take it down entirely today were sharing the latest in our ongoing work to keep groups safe which includes our thinking on how to keep recommendations safe as well as reducing privileges for those who break our rules these changes will roll out globally over the coming months improving group recommendations we know we have a greater responsibility when we are amplifying or recommending content as we work to make sure that potentially harmful groups arent recommended to people we try to be careful not to penalize high quality groups on similar topics the tension we navigate isnt between our business interests and removing low quality groups its about taking action on potentially harmful groups while still ensuring that community leaders can grow their groups that follow the rules and bring people value we try to balance this carefully in our recommendations guidelines which can be found here as behaviors evolve on our platform though we recognize we need to do more this is why we recently removed civic and political groups as well as newly created groups from recommendations in the us while people can still invite friends to these groups or search for them we have now started to expand these restrictions globally this builds on restrictions weve made to recommendations like removing health groups from these surfaces as well as groups that repeatedly share misinformation we are also adding more nuance to our enforcement when a group starts to violate our rules we will now start showing them lower in recommendations which means its less likely that people will discover them this is similar to our approach in news feed where we show lower quality posts further down so fewer people see them restricting the reach of rule breaking groups and members we believe that groups and members that violate our rules should have reduced privileges and reach with restrictions getting more severe as they accrue more violations until we remove them completely and when necessary in cases of severe harm we will outright remove groups and people without these steps in between groups well start to let people know when theyre about to join a group that has community standards violations so they can make a more informed decision before joining well limit invite notifications for these groups so people are less likely to join for existing members well reduce the distribution of that groups content so that its shown lower in news feed we think these measures as a whole along with demoting groups in recommendations will make it harder to discover and engage with groups that break our rules we will also start requiring admins and moderators to temporarily approve all posts when that group has a substantial number of members who have violated our policies or were part of other groups that were removed for breaking our rules this means that content wont be shown to the wider group until an admin or moderator reviews and approves it if an admin or moderator repeatedly approves content that breaks our rules well take the entire group down members when someone has repeated violations in groups we will block them from being able to post or comment for a period of time in any group they also wont be able to invite others to any groups and wont be able to create new groups these measures are intended to help slow down the reach of those looking to use our platform for harmful purposes and build on existing restrictions weve put in place over the last year there is always more to do to keep facebook groups safe and we will continue to build and invest to make sure people can rely on these places for connection and support"},{"id":"f8d82fab-699f-4f7f-94cc-9ad33639e327","platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/","date":"2021-03-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product

pandemic we have partnered with ministries of health and health focused organizations in more than 170 countries by providing free ads enabling partners to share their own public health guidance on covid 19 and information about the covid 19 vaccine for underserved countries and vulnerable populations such as ethnic minorities and refugees we also partner with expert local and international ngos such as international medical corps who are providing tailored covid 19 information in local languages in addition we continue to work with international bodies like the european union and african union in support of their covid 19 responses for example we have helped the european parliament run a multilingual ad campaign in their 27 member states featuring short in feed videos on facebook and instagram within a month the campaign drove strong awareness and consideration generating more than 100 million views and close to 2 million link clicks across all member states were also supporting the united nations only together campaign calling for fair and equitable access to covid 19 vaccines around the world in the coming days we will be launching in feed informational messages to promote content posted by health organizations who are participating in the uns campaign promoting reliable information about covid 19 vaccines in february in consultation with leading health organizations including the world health organization we expanded the list of false claims we will remove during the pandemic to include additional debunked claims about the coronavirus and vaccines since launching our new policy applying both to old and new content we have removed an additional 2 million pieces of content from facebook and instagram the majority of this additional content was previously subject to warning screens and is now removed from the platform were continuing to expand our efforts to address covid 19 vaccine misinformation by adding labels to facebook and instagram posts that discuss the vaccines these labels contain credible information about the safety of covid 19 vaccines from the world health organization for example were adding a label on posts that discuss the safety of covid 19 vaccines that notes covid 19 vaccines go through tests for safety and effectiveness before theyre approved this label is rolling out globally in english spanish indonesian portuguese arabic and french and we are adding additional languages in the coming weeks in the coming weeks were rolling out labels on all posts generally about covid 19 vaccines that point people to the covid 19 information center globally and plan to add additional targeted labels about covid 19 vaccine subtopics we will also add an additional screen when someone goes to share a post on facebook and instagram with an informational covid 19 vaccine label it will provide more information so people have the context they need to make informed decisions about what to share building on our goal to promote authoritative information about covid 19 vaccines we have implemented several temporary measures to further limit the spread of potentially harmful covid 19 and vaccine information during the pandemic some of these measures include reducing the distribution of content from users that have violated our policies on covid 19 and vaccine misinformation or that have repeatedly shared content debunked as false or altered by our third party fact checking partners and of any covid 19 or vaccine content that fact checking partners have rated as missing context requiring admins for groups with admins or members who have violated our covid 19 policies to temporarily approve all posts within their group continuing to further elevate information from authoritative sources when people seek

the dashboard is updated in near real time with data collected by our partners at carnegie mellon university and university of maryland as part of the covid 19 symptom survey for example globally the top two reasons why respondents say they do not intend to get vaccinated are fear of side effects and waiting to see if vaccines are safe facebook does not host the surveys nor collect survey

platforms and ctv are on the riseeven before the pandemic streaming was quickly becoming the preferred way to enjoy content the last year solidified this trend with increasing numbers of people abandoning traditional linear tv according toemarketer more than 106 million u s households are projected to watch streaming content in 2021 eclipsing pay tv viewers are leaving behind traditional primetime and were finding at youtube that the new primetime is personal people want the freedom to stream anything whenever they want whether its a favorite movie a hard to find music performance a premiere sports event or even a tough workout viewers are also increasingly streaming content on their connected tv screens as they spend more time at home in fact though mobile still makes up the largest percentage of how content is consumed on the platform our fastest growing viewing experience is on the tv screen last december over 120 million people in the u s streamed youtube or youtube tv on their tv screens and theres another interesting viewing behavior emerging a new generation of viewers chooses to watch youtube primarily on the tv screen also in december over a quarter of logged in youtube ctv viewers in the u s watched content almost exclusively on the tv screen 1 for advertisers the move to streaming on tv screens brings both challenges and opportunities some challenges like planning what to buy and measuring impact arent exactly new solutions are being developed to address these issues and have already broken new ground for example for the first time ever this 2021 2022 upfront season in the u s advertisers will be able to measure their youtube ctv campaigns with nielsen as for opportunities streaming gives advertisers more places to reach those customers who have been abandoning tv for streaming platforms including hard to reach viewers and while much has been made about the complexity and fragmentation of audiences the number of ad supported platforms with scale is actually pretty small according to comscore 82 5 percent of ctv reach in the u s falls on only five streaming services netflix youtube amazon prime hulu and disney but only two sell ads 41 percent of all ad supported streaming watch time in the u s happens on youtube 2all of this makes clear how ctv has opened a significant new chapter for video on youtube and beyond e commerce is growing faster powered by digital videoits no secret that e commerce has been growing for years but the pandemic further fueled its jump last year in 2020 online shoppings share of total retail sales hit 21 3 a 44 spike from the previous year 3 and as this shift only continues to grow video will play an increasingly important role one reason is that consumers want the convenience of researching and reviewing products online at home but with the trusted guidance of an in store experience thats where youtubes creators come in theyve committed considerable time and effort into building authentic connections with fans and as a result deliver trusted brand and product recommendations to their audience just look at ijustine who vlogs about virtually all tech gear from mobile phones to consumer drones and gives expert reviews her fans have come to depend on not surprisingly according to a study we partnered with talkshoppe on in 2020 70 of youtube viewers say they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on youtube in my recent blog post launching this innovation series i discussed how were beta testing a new integrated shopping experience that lets viewers tap into the credibility and knowledge of creators to make informed purchases directly on youtube short form content is here for the long runthe growth of short form content on mobile has been remarkable to watch and it can be explained by two related developments easy paths to creation and consumption mobile devices offer simple but powerful tools for anyone to create or watch compelling content to give viewers the short form content theyve grown to love weve been developing our own short form mobile experience called shorts we began beta testing shorts last year in india with various creation tools including a multi segment camera the ability to record with music speed controls as well as a timer and countdown feature since the beginning of december the number of indian channels using shorts creation tools has more than tripled in the next few weeks well begin expanding the beta to the u s as these three trends lay out its an exciting time for digital video video empowers viewers to watch content as never before advertisers to reach customers as never before and creators and artists to find an audience as never before ctv e commerce and short form video will continue to play out in the years ahead and im looking forward to seeing what new trends redefine the place of video in our lives 1exclusive defined as 90 2 comscore ott intelligence mar 2020 u s 3according to one review of u s

supervised account today we are announcing a new choice for parents who have decided their tweens and teens are ready to explore youtube with a supervised account this generation of tweens and teens has grown up online and its where they go to learn laugh and connect every family has a different approach to how they use technology access the internet and set digital ground rules over the years weve made investments to protect families and kids on youtube such as launching a dedicated kids app better protecting their privacy restricting features and improving age restrictions today we are announcing a new choice for parents who have decided their tweens and teens are ready to explore youtube with a supervised account supervised experiences on youtubefrom our earliest days youtube has been a platform for people over 13 and weve always recommended that parents co watch with their kids if they choose to watch youtube in 2015 we created youtube kids a safer destination for kids to explore their interests while providing parental controls but since then weve heard from parents and older children that tweens and teens have different needs which werent being fully met by our products as children grow up they have insatiable curiosity and need to gain independence and find new ways to learn create and belong over the last year we ve worked with parents and experts across the globe in areas related to child safety child development and digital literacy to develop a solution for parents of tweens and teens in the coming months well launch a new experience in beta for parents to allow their children to access youtube through a supervised google account this supervised experience will come with content settings and limited features well start with an early beta for families with kids under the age of consent to test and provide feedback as we continue to expand and improve the experience giving parents content options on youtubewe know that every parent has a different parenting style and that every child is unique and reaches different developmental stages at different times thats why well give parents the ability to choose from 3 different content settings on youtube explore for children ready to move on from youtube kids and explore content on youtube this setting will feature a broad range of videos generally suitable for viewers ages 9 including vlogs tutorials gaming videos music clips news educational content and more explore more with content generally suitable for viewers ages 13 this setting will include an even larger set of videos and also live streams in the same categories as explore most of youtube this setting will contain almost all videos on youtube except for age restricted content and it includes sensitive topics that may only be appropriate for older teens this option was designed for parents who think their children are ready to explore the vast universe of youtube videos we will use a mix of user input machine learning and human review to determine which videos are included we know that our systems will make mistakes and will continue to evolve over time we recommend parents continue to be involved in guiding and supporting their childs experience on youtube to help parents get started weve developed a guide in partnership with national pta parent zone and be internet awesome well also launch an ongoing campaign that features creators discussing themes like bullying and harassment misinformation digital well being and more new features for familieswe understand the importance of striking a balance between empowering tweens and teens to more safely gain independence while offering parents ways to set controls in addition to choosing the content setting parents will be able to manage watch and search history from within their child s account settings parents can also use other controls offered by googles family link including screen timers well continue adding new parental controls over time such as blocking content when a parent grants access to youtube their childs experience will feel much like regular youtube but certain features will be disabled to protect younger audiences for example we won t serve personalized ads or ads in certain categories at launch we ll also disable in app purchases as well as creation and comments features since self expression and community are integral parts of youtube and children s development over time we ll work with parents and experts to add some of these features through an age appropriate and parent controlled approach

personal messages will always be end to end encrypted so whatsapp cant read or listen to them weve reflected on what we could have done better here we want everyone to know our history of defending end to end encryption and trust were committed to protecting peoples privacy and security were now using our status feature to share our values and updates directly within whatsapp well be doing much more to make our voice clear going forward in the coming weeks well display a banner in whatsapp providing more information that people can read at their own pace weve also included more information to try and address concerns were hearing eventually well start reminding people to review and accept these updates to keep using whatsapp we also think its important people know how we can provide whatsapp for free every day millions of people start a whatsapp chat with a business because its easier to do so than placing a phone call or exchanging emails we charge businesses to provide customer service on whatsapp not people some shopping features involve facebook so that businesses can manage their inventory across apps we display more information directly in whatsapp so people can choose if they want to engage with businesses or not during this time we understand some people may check out other apps to see what they have to offer weve seen some of our competitors try to get away with claiming they cant see peoples messages if an app doesnt offer end to end encryption by default that means they can read your messages other apps say theyre better because they know even less information than whatsapp we believe people are looking for apps to be both reliable and safe even if that requires whatsapp having some limited data we strive to be thoughtful on the decisions we

with the australian government and appreciate the constructive discussions weve had with treasurer frydenberg and minister fletcher over the past week we have consistently supported a framework that would encourage innovation and collaboration between online platforms and publishers after further discussions we are satisfied that the australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them as a result of these changes we can now work to further our investment in public interest journalism and restore news on facebook for australians in the coming days read an additional statement from campbell brown vp global news partnerships on our facebook journalism project site originally published on february 17 2021 at 10 31am pt in response to australias proposed new media bargaining law facebook will restrict publishers and people in australia from sharing or viewing australian and international news content the proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content it has left us facing a stark choice attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship or stop allowing news content on our services in australia with a heavy heart we are choosing the latter this discussion has focused on us technology companies and how they benefit from news content on their services we understand many will ask why the platforms may respond differently the answer is because our platforms have fundamentally different relationships with news google search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content on the other hand publishers willingly choose to post news on facebook as it allows them to sell more subscriptions grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue in fact and as we have made clear to the australian government for many months the value exchange between facebook and publishers runs in favor of the publishers which is the reverse of what the legislation would require the arbitrator to assume last year facebook generated approximately 5 1 billion free referrals to australian publishers worth an estimated au 407 million for facebook the business gain from news is minimal news makes up less than 4 of the content people see in their news feed journalism is important to a democratic society which is why we build dedicated free tools to support news organisations around the world in innovating their content for online audiences over the last three years weve worked with the australian government to find a solution that recognizes the realities of how our services work weve long worked toward rules that would encourage innovation and collaboration between digital platforms and news organisations unfortunately this legislation does not do that instead it seeks to penalise facebook for content it didnt take or ask for we were prepared to launch facebook news in australia and significantly increase our investments with local publishers however we were only prepared to do this with the right rules in place this legislation sets a precedent where the government decides who enters into these news content agreements and ultimately how much the party that already receives value from the free service gets paid we will now prioritise investments to other countries as part of our plans to invest in new licensing news programs and experiences others have also raised concern independent experts and analysts around the world have consistently outlined problems with the proposed legislation while the government has made some changes the proposed law fundamentally fails to understand how our services work unfortunately this means people and news organisations in australia are now restricted from posting news links and sharing or viewing australian and international news content on facebook globally posting and sharing news links from australian publishers is also restricted to do this we are using a combination of technologies to restrict news content and we will have processes to review any content that was inadvertently removed for australian publishers this means they are restricted from sharing or posting any content on facebook pages admins will still be able to access other features from their facebook page including page insights and creator studio we will continue to provide access to all other standard facebook services including data tools and crowdtangle for international publishers this means they can continue to publish news content on facebook but links and posts cant be viewed or shared by australian audiences for our australian community this means they cannot view or share australian or international news content on facebook or content from australian and international news pages for our international community this means they cannot view or share australian news content on facebook or content from australian news pages the changes affecting news content will not otherwise change facebooks products and services in australia we want to assure the millions of australians using facebook to connect with friends and family grow their businesses and join groups to help support their local communities that these services will not change we recognise its important to connect people to authoritative information and we will continue to promote dedicated information hubs like the covid 19 information centre that connects australians with relevant health information our commitment to remove harmful misinformation and provide access to credible and timely information will not change we remain committed to our third party fact checking program with agence france presse and australian associated press and will continue to invest to support their important work our global commitment to invest in quality news also has not changed we recognise that news provides a vitally important role in society and democracy which is why we recently expanded facebook news to hundreds of publications in the uk we hope that in the future the australian government will recognise the value we already provide and

part of these tests to address feedback from people wanting to see less political content in their feed we put less weight on comments and shares when ranking political content when surveyed people who experienced these changes said they saw less of the content they did not find valuable based on those results were further expanding tests globally well continue to share updates as we assess and

to see less political content in their news feed as a result we plan to expand these tests to costa rica sweden spain and ireland weve also learned that some engagement signals can better indicate what posts people find more valuable than others based on that feedback were gradually expanding some tests to put less emphasis on signals such as how likely someone is to comment on or share political content at the same time were putting more emphasis on new signals such as how likely people are to provide us with negative feedback on posts about political topics and current events when we rank those types of posts in their news feed weve learned that these changes will affect public affairs content more broadly and that publishers may see an impact on their traffic knowing this we are planning a gradual and methodical rollout for these tests but remain encouraged and expect to announce further expansions in the coming months update on february 17 2021 at 10 55am pt the initial tests to reduce the distribution of political content in news feed are now live in the us for a small percentage of users originally published on february 10 2021 at 5 00am pt as mark zuckerberg mentioned on our recent earnings call one common piece of feedback we hear is that people dont want political content to take over their news feed over the next few months well work to better understand peoples varied preferences for political content and test a number of approaches based on those insights as a first step well temporarily reduce the distribution of political content in news feed for a small percentage of people in canada brazil and indonesia this week and the us in the coming weeks during these initial tests well explore a variety of ways to rank political content in peoples feeds using different signals and then decide on the approaches well use going forward covid 19 information from authoritative health organizations like the cdc and who as well as national and regional health agencies and services from affected countries will be exempt from these tests content from official government agencies and services will also be exempt to determine how effective these new approaches are well survey people about their experience during these tests its important to note that were not removing political content from facebook altogether our goal is to preserve the ability for people to find and interact with political content on facebook while respecting each persons appetite for it at the top of their news feed based on our analyses in the us political content only makes up about 3 this number was updated on november 4 2022 of what people see on facebook and although each persons news feed is different we know even a small percentage of political

other governments and health authorities including the south africa government and the who are starting to create similar helplines to provide the latest vaccine information were also working to amplify content that directly serves communities where vaccine intent and access may be lower in the us were partnering with the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health to reach native american communities black communities and latinx communities among others with science and evidence based content that addresses the questions and concerns these communities have were also working with aarp to reach americans over 50 with educational content about covid 19 vaccines including spanish language content designed to reach latinx and hispanic communities this builds on the work weve done with health organizations over the past year to increase adoption of covid 19 preventive behaviors such as wearing a mask we put reminders at the top of facebook and instagram to wear a mask and we reached over 26 million people with our public figure campaign encouraging people to wearamask resulting in a 7 point increase in people reporting that wearing a mask in public is very or extremely important well use insights and best practices from this work to inform vaccine information campaigns and support health authorities in building confidence in covid 19 vaccines combating vaccine

university delphi research group and the university of maryland on covid 19 surveys about symptoms people are experiencing mask wearing behaviors and access to care these surveys are conducted by our academic partners and facebook does not receive individual survey responses with over 50 million responses to date the survey program is one of the largest ever conducted and has helped health researchers better monitor and forecast the spread of covid 19 its also the only source of global data on mask wearing which has helped public health officials around the world in their covid 19 response efforts the institute of health metrics and evaluation used insights from the surveys to inform several mask mandates in countries such as poland which achieved a significant increase in mask wearing the survey data shows that peoples willingness to get a covid 19 vaccine varies widely across the world with over 90 of people in denmark saying they would take a covid 19 vaccine compared to 71 in argentina and 62 in the philippines and in the us less than 60 of black or african american people reported they would be likely to get a covid 19 vaccine so to help guide the effective delivery of covid 19 vaccines the survey data will provide a better understanding of trends in vaccine intent across sociodemographics race geography and more the scale of the survey will also allow for faster updates on changes in trends such as whether vaccine intent is going up or down in california in a given week and better insights on how vaccine intent varies at a local level well share these new

use them starting today people on twitter have the option to use security keys as their only form of two factor authentication 2fa which is the most effective way to keep your twitter account secure while any form of 2fa is better than no 2fa physical security keys are the most effective security keys are small devices that act like keys to your house just as you need a physical key to unlock the door to your home you need a security key to unlock access to your account security keys offer the strongest protection for your twitter account because they have built in protections to ensure that even if a key is used on a phishing site the information shared cant be used to access your account they use the fido and webauthn security standards to transfer the burden of protecting against phishing attempts from a human to a hardware device security keys can differentiate legitimate sites from malicious ones and block phishing attempts that sms or verification codes would not twitter has long encouraged the use of some form of 2fa in 2018 we added the option to use security keys as one of several 2fa options however this initial support only worked for twitter com not the mobile app and required accounts to have another form of 2fa enabled as well in 2019 we upgraded our security key support to use the latest webauthn standard which provides an up to date and secure authentication method recognized across the web we also enabled the ability to use 2fa on a twitter account without requiring a phone number allowing people to protect their accounts from sim swapping attacks and opening up 2fa to more people in 2020 we made additional improvements by enabling support for security keys on ios and android in addition to the web and earlier this year we added the ability to register multiple security keys on your twitter account allowing you to have backup security keys and making it easier for accounts managed by multiple people to enable 2fa with multiple security keys today were adding the option to use security keys as your sole 2fa method meaning you can enroll one or more security keys as the only form of 2fa on your twitter account without a backup 2fa method we know this is important to people because not everyone is able to have a backup 2fa method or wants to share their phone number with us with this update we want everyone to feel empowered to enable security keys to better secure their twitter account well continue to make updates and improvements to the ways you can keep your twitter account

now as you heard from us earlier this year were back and putting more energy into testing out the potential for shopping on twitter as one of our first steps forward today were launching a pilot of the shop spotlight a feature that allows us to explore how shoppable profiles can create a pathway from talking about and discovering products on twitter to actually purchasing them the shop spotlight is a dedicated space at the top of a profile where businesses can showcase their products when people visit a profile with the shop spotlight enabled they can scroll through the carousel of products and tap through on a single product to learn more and purchase seamlessly in an in app browser without having to leave twitter were starting small with a handful of brands in the united states people in the u s who use twitter in english on ios and android devices will be able to see the shop spotlight we believe in the power of the conversations that twitter facilitates around products with this pilot well get to explore how our engaged responsive and chatty audience reacts to products that are emotionally charged like a new jersey from your favorite sports team or that provide lasting impact like a new skincare regimen and fundamentally itll give us the chance to keep learning about which shopping experiences people prefer on twitter as we learn were creating deeper partnerships with businesses that reflect whom were building for with a new merchant advisory board the board will consist of brands that have established themselves as best in class examples of merchants on twitter with their partnership we hope to more easily address the needs of businesses of any size or vertical in our product innovation while the shop spotlight is a step in better supporting shopping on

contributors in this first phase of the pilot notes will only be visible on a separate birdwatch site on this site pilot participants can also rate the helpfulness of notes added by other contributors these notes are being intentionally kept separate from twitter for now while we build birdwatch and gain confidence that it produces context people find helpful and appropriate additionally notes will not have an effect on the way people see tweets or our system recommendations building together to date we have conducted more than 100 qualitative interviews with individuals across the political spectrum who use twitter and we received broad general support for birdwatch in particular people valued notes being in the communitys voice rather than that of twitter or a central authority and appreciated that notes provided useful context to help them better understand and evaluate a tweet rather than focusing on labeling content as true or false our goal is to build birdwatch in the open and have it shaped by the twitter community to that end were also taking significant steps to make birdwatch transparent all data contributed to birdwatch will be publicly available and downloadable in tsv files as we develop algorithms that power birdwatch such as reputation and consensus systems we aim to publish that code publicly in the birdwatch guide the initial ranking system for birdwatch is already available here we hope this will enable experts researchers and the public to analyze or audit birdwatch identifying opportunities or flaws that can help us more quickly build an effective community driven solution we want to invite anyone to sign up and participate in this program and know that the broader and more diverse the group the better birdwatch will be at effectively addressing misinformation more details on how to apply here whats next we know there are a number of challenges toward building a community driven system like this from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isnt dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors well be focused on these things throughout the pilot from embedding a member of the university of chicagos center for risc on our team to hosting feedback sessions with experts in a variety of disciplines were also reaching beyond our virtual walls and integrating social science and academic perspectives into the development of birdwatch we know this might be messy and have problems at times but we believe this is a model worth trying we invite you to learn alongside as we continue to explore different ways of addressing a common problem follow birdwatch for the latest updates and to provide feedback on how we are doing"},{"id":"a795b990-d1da-4f15-8d4c-af863370e8ae","platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/bringing-tips-to-everyone","date":"2021-01-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Bringing

News","Technology & Innovation"],"title":"Using AI to Improve Photo Descriptions for Blind and Visually Impaired People","text":"update on november 2 2021 at 12 05 pm pt today we announced a significant reduction in our use of facial recognition technology including the deletion of face recognition templates that we previously used to identify faces in photos this means automatic alt text will still be able to recognize when a person is in a photo but it will no longer include names of people originally posted on january 19 2021 at 10 00 am pt when facebook users scroll through their news feed they find all kinds of content articles friends comments event invitations and of course photos most people are able to instantly see whats in these images whether its their new grandchild a boat on a river or a grainy picture of a band onstage but many users who are blind or visually impaired bvi can also experience that imagery provided its tagged properly with alternative text or alt text a screen reader can describe the contents of these images using a synthetic voice and enable people who are bvi to understand images in their facebook feed unfortunately many photos are posted without alt text so in 2016 we introduced a new technology called automatic alternative text aat aat which was recognized in 2018 with the helen keller achievement award from the american foundation for the blind utilizes object recognition to generate descriptions of photos on demand so that blind or visually impaired individuals can more fully enjoy their news feed weve been improving it ever since and are excited to unveil the next generation of aat the latest iteration of aat represents multiple technological advances that improve the photo experience for our users first and foremost weve expanded the number of concepts that aat can reliably detect and identify in a photo by more than 10x which in turn means fewer photos without a description descriptions are also more detailed with the ability to identify activities landmarks types of animals and so forth for example may be a selfie of 2 people outdoors the leaning tower of pisa and weve achieved an industry first by making it possible to include information about the positional location and relative size of elements in a photo so instead of describing the contents of a photo as may be an image of 5 people we can specify that there are two people in the center of the photo and three others scattered toward the fringes implying that the two in the center are the focus or instead of simply describing a lovely landscape with may be a house and a mountain we can highlight that the mountain is the primary object in a scene based on how large it appears in comparison with the house at its base taken together these advancements help users who are blind or visually impaired better understand whats in photos posted by their family and friends and in their own photos by providing more and more detailed information where we started the concept of alt text dates back to the early days of the internet providing slow dial up connections with a text alternative to downloading bandwidth intensive images of course alt text also helped people who are blind or visually impaired navigate the internet since it can be used by screen reader software to generate spoken image descriptions unfortunately faster internet speeds made alt text less of a priority for many users and since these descriptions needed to be added manually by whoever uploaded an image many photos began to feature no alt text at all with no recourse for the people who had relied on it nearly five years ago we leveraged facebooks computer vision expertise to help solve this problem the first version of aat was developed using human labeled data with which we trained a deep convolutional neural network using millions of examples in a supervised fashion our completed aat model could recognize 100 common concepts like tree mountain and outdoors and since people who use facebook often share photos of friends and family our aat descriptions used facial recognition models that identified people as long as those people gave explicit opt in consent for people who are bvi this was a giant step forward seeing more of the world but we knew there was more that aat could do and the next logical step was to expand the number of recognizable objects and refine how we described them to achieve this we moved away from fully supervised learning with human labeled data while this method delivers precision the time and effort involved in labeling data are extremely high and thats why our original aat model reliably recognized only 100 objects recognizing that this approach would not scale we needed a new path forward for our latest iteration of aat we leveraged a model trained on weakly supervised data in the form of billions of public instagram images and their hashtags to make our models work better for everyone we fine tuned them so that data was sampled from images across all geographies and using translations of hashtags in many languages we also evaluated our concepts along gender skin tone and age axes the resulting models are both more accurate and culturally and demographically inclusive for instance they can identify weddings around the world based in part on traditional apparel instead of labeling only photos featuring white wedding dresses it also gave us the ability to more readily repurpose machine learning models as the starting point for training on new tasks a process known as transfer learning this enabled us to create models that identified concepts such as national monuments food types like fried rice and french fries and selfies this entire process wouldnt have been possible in the past to get richer information like position and counts we also trained a two stage object detector called faster r cnn using detectron2 an open source platform for object detection and segmentation developed by facebook ai research we trained the models to predict locations and semantic labels of the objects within an image multilabel multidata set training techniques helped make our model more reliable with the larger label space the improved aat reliably recognizes over 1 200 concepts more than 10 times as many as the original version we launched in 2016 as we consulted with screen reader users regarding aat and how best to improve it they made it clear that accuracy is paramount to that end weve included only those concepts for which we could ensure well trained models that met a certain high threshold of precision while there is a margin for error which is why we start every description with may be weve set the bar very high and have intentionally omitted concepts that we couldnt reliably identify we want to give our users who are blind or visually impaired as much information as possible about a photos contents but only correct information delivering details having increased the number of objects recognized while maintaining a high level of accuracy we turned our attention to figuring out how to best describe what we found in a photo we asked users who depend on screen readers how much information they wanted to hear and when they wanted to hear it they wanted more information when an image is from friends or family and less when its not we designed the new aat to provide a succinct description for all photos by default but offer an easy way to get more detailed descriptions about photos of specific interest when users select that latter option a panel is presented that provides a more comprehensive description of a photos contents including a count of the elements in the photo some of which may not have been mentioned in the default description detailed descriptions also include simple positional information top middle bottom or left center right and a comparison of the relative prominence of objects described as primary secondary or minor these words were specifically chosen to minimize ambiguity feedback on this feature during development showed that using a word like big to describe an object could be confusing because its unclear whether the reference is to its actual size or its size relative to other objects in an image even a chihuahua looks large if its photographed up close aat uses simple phrasing for its default description rather than a long flowy sentence its not poetic but it is highly functional our users can read and understand the description quickly and it lends itself to translation so all the alt text descriptions are available in 45 different languages ensuring that aat is useful to people around the world facebook is for everyone every day our users share billions of photos the ubiquity of inexpensive cameras in mobile phones fast wireless connections and social media products like instagram and facebook have made it easy to capture and share photography and help make it one of the most popular ways to communicate including for individuals who are blind or visually impaired while we wish everyone who uploaded a photo would include an alt text description we recognize that this often doesnt happen we built aat to bridge this gap and the impact its had on those who need it is immeasurable ai promises extraordinary advances and were excited to have the opportunity to bring these advances to communities that are so often underserved"},{"id":"ab37814a-0dd1-4a9b-96e8-d273b35d1bbe","platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/our-continued-collaboration-with-trusted-partners","date":"2021-01-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Partnerships","Policy","Product","Safety","Company"],"title":"Our

algorithm a fairness assessment of our home timeline recommendations across racial subgroups an analysis of content recommendations for different political ideologies across seven countries applying our learnings to improve twitter the most impactful applications of responsible ml will come from how we apply our learnings to build a better twitter the meta team works to study how our systems work and uses those findings to improve the experience people have on twitter this may result in changing our product such as removing an algorithm and giving people more control over the images they tweet or in new standards into how we design and build policies when they have an outsized impact on one particular community the results of this work may not always translate into visible product changes but it will lead to heightened awareness and important discussions around the way we build and apply ml were also building explainable ml solutions so you can better understand our algorithms what informs them and how they impact what you see on twitter similarly algorithmic choice will allow people to have more input and control in shaping what they want twitter to be for them were currently in the early stages of exploring this and will share more soon sharing our learnings and asking for feedback both inside and outside of twitter we will share our learnings and best practices to improve the industrys collective understanding of this topic help us improve our approach and hold us accountable this may come in the form of peer reviewed research data insights high level descriptions of our findings or approaches and even some of our unsuccessful attempts to address these emerging challenges well continue to work closely with third party academic researchers to identify ways we can improve our work and encourage their feedback the public plays a critical role in shaping twitter and responsibleml is no different public feedback is particularly important as we assess the fairness and equity of the automated systems we use better more informed decisions are made when the people who use twitter are part of the process and were looking to create more opportunities for people to share their thoughts on how ml is used on twitter whats next responsible ml is a long journey in its early days we want to explore it with a spirit of openness with the goal of contributing positively to the field of technology ethics if you have any questions about responsible ml or the work metas doing feel free to ask us using asktwittermeta if youd like to help

that aims to reduce disruptive interactions starting today were rolling out this safety feature to a small feedback group on ios android and twitter com beginning with accounts that have english language settings enabled heres how it works safety mode is a feature that temporarily blocks accounts for seven days for using potentially harmful language such as insults or hateful remarks or sending repetitive and uninvited replies or mentions when the feature is turned on in your settings our systems will assess the likelihood of a negative engagement by considering both the tweets content and the relationship between the tweet author and replier our technology takes existing relationships into account so accounts you follow or frequently interact with will not be autoblocked authors of tweets found by our technology to be harmful or uninvited will be autoblocked meaning theyll temporarily be unable to follow your account see your tweets or send you direct messages you can find information about the tweets flagged through safety mode and view the details of temporarily blocked accounts at any time before each safety mode period ends youll receive a notification recapping this information we wont always get this right and may make mistakes so safety mode autoblocks can be seen and undone at any time in your settings well also regularly monitor the accuracy of our safety mode systems to make improvements to our detection capabilities how we got here we want you to enjoy healthy conversations so this test is one way we re limiting overwhelming and unwelcome interactions that can interrupt those conversations our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks throughout the product development process we conducted several listening and feedback sessions for trusted partners with expertise in online safety mental health and human rights including members of our trust and safety council their feedback influenced adjustments to make safety mode easier to use and helped us think through ways to address the potential manipulation of our technology these trusted partners also played an important role in nominating twitter account owners to join the feedback group prioritizing people from marginalized communities and female journalists as members of the trust safety council we provided feedback on safety mode to ensure it entails mitigations that protect counter speech while also addressing online harassment towards women and journalists safety mode is another step in the right direction towards making twitter a safe place to participate in the public conversation without fear of abuse article 19 a human rights organization that champions digital rights and equality we also committed to the world wide web foundations framework to end online gender based violence and participated in a series of discussions to explore new ways for women to customize their experience with safety online using features like safety mode whats next well observe how safety mode is working and incorporate improvements and adjustments before bringing it to everyone on twitter stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build on our work to empower people with the tools they need to feel more comfortable participating in the public

work supporting the integrity of the 2020 u s election updates to our work supporting the integrity of the 2020 u s election over the past weeks and months weve seen people coming to youtube to learn more about where and how to vote or learning more about a candidate or an issue weve seen news organizations grow their audience and weve seen people turn to youtube for the latest election results or simply to follow an historic event with the highest voting turnout in over a century in the u s our main goal going into the election season was to make sure were connecting people with authoritative information while also limiting the reach of misinformation and removing harmful content the work here is ongoing and we wanted to provide an update removing content that violates our policiesour community guidelines prohibit spam scams or other manipulated media coordinated influence operations and any content that seeks to incite violence since september we ve terminated over 8000 channels and thousands of harmful and misleading elections related videos for violating our existing policies over 77 of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views we also work to make sure that the line between what is removed and what is allowed is drawn in the right place our policies prohibit misleading viewers about where and how to vote we also disallow content alleging widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of a historical u s presidential election however in some cases that has meant allowing controversial views on the outcome or process of counting votes of a current election as election officials have worked to finalize counts yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the u s presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a president elect given that we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today or anytime after that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 u s presidential election in line with our approach towards historical u s presidential elections for example we will remove videos claiming that a presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors we will begin enforcing this policy today and will ramp up in the weeks to come as always news coverage and commentary on these issues can remain on our site if theres sufficient education documentary scientific or artistic context connecting people to authoritative informationwhile only a small portion of watch time is election related content youtube continues to be an important source of election news on average 88 of the videos in top 10 search results related to elections came from authoritative news sources amongst the rest are things like newsy late night shows creator videos and commentary and the most viewed channels and videos are from news channels like nbc and cbs we also showed information panels linking both to googles election results feature which sources election results from the associated press and to the cybersecurity infrastructure security agencys cisa rumor control page for debunking election integrity misinformation alongside these and over 200 000 other election related videos collectively these information panels have been shown over 4 5 billion times starting today we will update this information panel linking to the 2020 electoral college results page from the office of the federal register noting that as of december 8 states have certified presidential election results with joe biden as the president elect it will also continue to include a link to cisa explaining that states certify results after ensuring ballots are properly counted and correcting irregularities and errors additionally since election day relevant fact check information panels from third party fact checkers were triggered over 200 000 times above relevant election related search results including for voter fraud narratives such as dominion voting machines and michigan recount now lets look at recommendations one of the main ways our viewers find content limiting the reach of borderline content and prominently surfacing authoritative information are important ways we protect people from problematic content that doesnt violate our community guidelines over 70 of recommendations on election related topics came from authoritative news sources and the top recommended videos and channels for election related content were primarily authoritative news in fact the top 10 authoritative news channels were recommended over 14x more than the top 10 non authoritative channels on election related content despite these encouraging results we recognize there s always more to do for example while problematic misinformation represents a fraction of 1 of what s watched on youtube in the u s we know we can bring that number down even more and some videos while not recommended prominently on youtube continue to get high views sometimes coming from other sites we re continuing to consider this and other new challenges as we make ongoing improvements we understand the need for intense scrutiny on our elections related work our teams work hard to ensure we are striking a balance between allowing for a broad range of political speech and making sure our platform isn t abused to incite real world harm or broadly spread harmful misinformation we welcome ongoing debate and discussion and will keep engaging with experts researchers and organizations to ensure that our policies and products are meeting that goal and as always we ll apply learnings from this election to our ongoing efforts to protect the integrity of elections around the world related topics products and

johanna wright vice president of product management at youtube dec 03 2020 copy link copy link how we re focused on improving comments and supporting creators how we re focused on improving comments and supporting creators since its early days youtube has always strived to be a place where creators of all backgrounds can have a voice find a community and even build a business including many that may be underrepresented or might not otherwise have had a platform were committed to supporting the diverse creator communities on youtube and their continued success as our ceo susan wojcicki wrote in june were examining how our policies and products are working for everyone and specifically for the black community and working to close any gaps today i want to share an update on that progress while the work we re sharing today is anchored in this effort we think these changes will ultimately benefit the entire youtube community removing harmful and hateful commentswe know that comments play a key role in helping creators connect with their community but issues with the quality of comments is also one of the most consistent pieces of feedback we receive from creators we have been focused on improving comments with the goal of driving healthier conversations on youtube over the last few years we launched new features to help creators engage with their community and shape the tone of conversations on their channels weve heard from creators that while these changes helped them better manage comments and connect with their audience theres more we can do to prevent them from seeing hurtful comments in the first place to address that well be testing a new filter in youtube studio for potentially inappropriate and hurtful comments that have been automatically held for review so that creators dont ever need to read them if they dont want to well also be streamlining the comment moderation tools to make this process even easier for creators to encourage respectful conversations on youtube were launching anew featurethat will warn users when their comment may be offensive to others giving them the option to reflect before posting in addition weve also invested in technology that helps our systems better detect and remove hateful comments by taking into account the topic of the video and the context of a comment these efforts are making an impact since early 2019 we ve increased the number of daily hate speech comment removals by 46x and in the last quarter of the more than 1 8 million channels we terminated for violating our policies more than 54 000 terminations were for hate speech this is the most hate speech terminations in a single quarter and 3x more than the previous high from q2 2019 when we updated our hate speech policy continuing our commitment to support creatorsour goal is to make youtube a place where creators can thrive in the long term and weve done extensive work in this area but we ve heard concerns across various communities about their ability to grow their channels we want to ensure our systems do not reflect unintentional bias and the existing process is currently limited because we only have information about content not identifying information about the creators themselves to better evaluate a concern from a specific creator community e g concerns that our monetization systems are working differently for different creators we need to have data about which videos come from which communities today we can identify what a video is about but this does not take into account who the creator is or how they identify for example our systems can evaluate how videos about black lives matters are performing against other content on youtube regardless of the creator but were currently not able to evaluate growth for black beauty creators lgbtq talk show hosts female vloggers or any other community today were announcing a new effort to help us more proactively identify potential gaps in our systems that might impact a creators opportunity to reach their full potential starting in 2021 youtube will ask creators on a voluntary basis to provide us with their gender sexual orientation race and ethnicity well then look closely at how content from different communities is treated in our search and discovery and monetization systems well also be looking for possible patterns of hate harassment and discrimination that may affect some communities more than others this survey will be an additional way for creators to participate in initiatives that youtube hosts like youtubeblack creator gatherings and fanfest if theyre interested identity is something that is inherently personal and sharing this information should always be optional our creators privacy and ability to provide consent for how their information is used is critical in the survey we will explain how information will be used and how the creator controls their information for example the information gathered will not be used for advertising purposes and creators will have the ability to opt out and delete their information entirely at any time youtube is consulting with creators as we develop our survey which will launch initially in the us in early 2021 and well continue this project with the guidance of civil and human rights experts if we find any issues in our systems that impact specific communities were committed to working to fix them and well continue to share our progress on these efforts with you the steps were announcing today are part of our ongoing work to ensure that youtube continues to be a platform where creators of all backgrounds can thrive we appreciate the partnership of the black lgbtq and latinx creator communities who have consulted with us in these efforts

peace of mind","text":"by v jay la rosa global security tiktokat tiktok our security team is constantly working to make people safer in an environment of ever evolving threats over the past few years consumers have become much more aware of potential risks a smarter more well informed community is better for everyone including those of us in the security field it pushes us to constantly improve our systems and efforts and question all of our underlying assumptions this is part of why we ve continued to rapidly develop our team including adding hundreds of engineers in the us over the last year we also know it s not enough to keep users safe from real threats we also need to further reduce the potential confusion that can arise from things that can be perceived or misinterpreted as threats as engineers we re innately attuned to actual and potential threats but providing users with true peace of mind can only come when we stretch ourselves beyond the actual and potential realm and appreciate perception earlier this year for example we saw speculation about clipboard access that we believe posed no actual risk but appreciated that there was concern we immediately took steps to reduce clipboard access even though information was never leaving a user s device and was consistent with the behavior of what other apps including most news media apps were doing we believe it is more important to provide peace of mind to our community than to provide marginal functionality of a feature or give convenience to a user or engineer in line with this we continue to work on similar efforts around cleaning up inactive code in the app to reduce potential confusion or misconceptions for example we are enhancing the ecosystem around our self developed code for automated attack defense that detects and prevents inauthentic and bot like behavior and integrating new and advanced industry leading partners to prevent abuse these efforts go beyond what many of our peers do and require extensive time and resources but we view this as one of the most important moves we can make to build trust with our community we appreciate when security experts ask critical questions about how technology companies are keeping our community safe because this moves trust and safety forward for all users which is the most important thing companies can achieve after all tiktok s goal is to inspire creativity and bring joy and we can achieve that most effectively when users have complete peace of

creators from this exemption we hope apple will consider permanently changing its requirement for apps to use its payment processing platform as well as reduce the associated 30 tax such a high tax

creativity and connect with users who share your same interests we made the for you feed to help people discover a broad range of content that they are uniquely interested in and to amplify the voices and creativity within our community by connecting creators with viewers who love their content we get asked often about how you can make your videos stand out questions about what to post when to post and how you can connect with viewers who love what you share in this blog we ll answer these questions and more share some best tips and tricks and bust some myths while there s more to tiktok than making it big on for you feeds we know that getting your videos discovered is a big part of what makes it so fun to be a creator we hope you find these pointers helpful and we re excited to see what you share happy creating making videos that stand out captivating videos often have lots in common they tell stories draw us in and spark conversation but what can you do to make your videos stand out from the rest it often comes down to a few basics video format vertical videos perform best on tiktok as do videos that are longer than five seconds video captions sometimes a great caption is just as captivating as the content of a video use the space in captions to add context and share more about a video creative effects voice effects and sounds whether you re freeze framing voice overing or dueting with a friend creative effects and video tools can help bring your content to life you ll find creative effects on the record video page at the bottom left corner of your screen measuring video performance a great way to gauge audience interests is to review your video analytics by switching to a pro account you can use our analytics tool to gain a better understanding of content performance and engagement analytics offer an overview and insights on things like your weekly and monthly views follower growth and trending videos so how should you use analytics and which metrics matter most consider the big picture lots of factors determine how content is recommended in the for you feed so no one engagement metric is necessarily more important than another as you survey how your videos are performing you should make note of high level trends in your analytics and broadly how audiences are engaging with your content and account rather than focusing on a single metric such as likes or comments from video to video measuring performance for new videos for you feed recommendations generally pull from videos posted within the last 90 days and newly uploaded videos will generally see a peak in engagement soon after they ve been published if viewers continue to find your video interesting it will continue to be recommended video performance extends over a couple of days so if you don t immediately see the performance you expect keep your video up to give it time to generate full performance results keeping viewers interested watch time factors into how a video gets recommended so capturing viewers attention early and maintaining it throughout makes for watchable shareable content our recommendation system takes watch time as a signal that users are enjoying your content keeping this in mind as you create will help you make videos that are deeply engaging from beginning to end and as a result positioned for strong performance connecting with the right audiencesas you post videos and track viewer engagement you ll start to get an idea of the content your audiences love once you know what resonates you can take that as a signal about content that your audience wants more of put yourself in the minds of your viewers by considering how they ve engaged with your videos in the past and posting videos you think they d like to see next to increase the likelihood that your videos will connect with the right audiences consider the following hashtags add hashtags to your captions that are relevant to your videos so they re more likely to be found by the right audiences more hashtags won t guarantee a broader reach and there s only so much space in your captions so only add hashtags that best represent what your video is about music and sounds from chart topping music to sounds made for lip syncs adding audio to your videos helps them stand out and connects your content with viewers who love the dances and challenges that go with the songs and sounds made popular on tiktok whether users save your original sound for their next video and turn it into a trend or find your content on the sounds search page as they scroll through results for their favorite tunes adding sounds helps make your videos more discoverable and shareable experimenting with content the amount of videos you post won t impact how your content is recommended in the for you feed and views vary from video to video that leaves you free to experiment get creative and post different kinds of content to see what resonates so what about foryou and fyp we all love finding out that our content has landed in someone else s for you feed and lots of creators will include hashtags like fyp in hopes that doing so will push their videos into more feeds in reality hashtags like fyp foryou and foryoupage work just like all other hashtags on tiktok so adding these to your caption wont necessarily improve your chances of getting on someones for you feed instead we recommend using the space in your caption to add context to your video along with hashtags that are relevant to your content you might consider tagging another creator whose content inspired yours or is relatable to yours or joining in on trending hashtags which highlight trending topics or video challenges remember anyone can be a creatorabove all remember that anyone can be a creator on tiktok

privacy on TikTok","text":"by sean kim head of product tiktok ustiktok is committed to building an experience that protects the safety and privacy of our community as part of our commitment to accountability roland cloutier our chief information security officer wrote about our ongoing review of our security infrastructure and practices as you may know the use of third party sdks software development kits is a common practice in the industry to foster a more convenient user experience but we have decided to take the step of eliminating all clipboard access not explicitly requested by the user this includes blocking sdks that go beyond typical practices in the sector in order to give users greater peace of mind during a recent review we identified a few examples of third parties such as facebook s sdk attempting to access our users clipboards and today we sent an update to the app store to block this kind of sdk access i d like to take a step back and describe how we cooperate with third party app developers most apps work with a number of developers to enable people to create great content and reach larger audiences for example developers like adobe or lightricks may launch a photo template or video editing app we partner with these trusted developers so that users can easily share content made on an outside or third party app to tiktok when a user wants to share content created on a third party app it is critical that we authenticate the outside app this helps to protect our platform and our community from malicious actors in the past we used uipasteboard in ios to copy authentication credentials over to tiktok these credentials included bundle id the third party app identifier with apple client key and secret unique identifiers that authorize the third party app with tiktok and unique id an identifier provided by the third party developer to attribute an id with the content that is being shared this id is created by the third party developer we have removed the code that enabled the process described above moving forward we will authenticate developers through a url schema we ve already informed existing third party developers of the fix and they are working on their end to make the transition smooth if you are a third party developer please visit our tiktok for developers website for the latest updates and news in the meantime users might see that they are unable to share a video or photo to tiktok until the third party developer updates to tiktokopensdk 4 0 0 we recognize the extra work this creates for developers and we appreciate their commitment to helping us protect the privacy of the tiktok community tiktok also partners with third party developers so that users can share tiktok videos on their social channels such as instagram or snapchat in order to make this happen some third party apps access a device s clipboard through an api starting with the new update tiktok will only allow a third party app to access a users clipboard when an action is expressly initiated by a user such as sharing to snapchat or instagram stories we are building a better experience that brings joy to the tiktok community and safeguards sensitive data and information as roland says security is a job that is never done but we are going to aggressively build an experience that respects and protects our

on our security roadmap","text":"by roland cloutier tiktok chief information security officerbuilding technology security defenses is a constant effort to anticipate plan and react what has been clear since i started this job almost three months ago is that the team at tiktok is fully committed to protecting the privacy of our users and providing transparency on our overall security efforts as i wrote a few weeks ago my team of security experts and i are undertaking a broad review of our security processes and infrastructure with this in mind i would like to update the community on some recent developments first let me start with some background earlier this year a report noted that many prominent apps including tiktok and other major entertainment as well as news apps were requesting access to users clipboards there are many legitimate reasons why something like this would occur for example if you copy text for a website in one app and then open a browser most browsers will ask if you want to paste the text and go to the url directly this is an example of how browsers attempt to make your user experience better but it requires the app to know that a url is sitting on the clipboard there are dozens of other reasons why apps might want to see if information is sitting on a user s clipboard in the case of tiktok this notification had been triggered by integration of the google ads sdk while this type of data was not sent to tiktok we appreciate that this issue was confusing to many users and could have led them to believe that tiktok itself was using the data for unclear purposes further the ubiquitous nature of third party ad programs helps explain why so many other apps indicated similar behavior in response on april 16 we updated our app so the ad program would not be able to access users clipboards last week following the launch of beta ios 14 tiktok users saw a similar ios notification when they tried to type comments on a video users also saw notifications on a number of other popular apps while i can t know for sure why users saw notifications for other apps i can explain why this happened with tiktok how this occurred shortly after a similar issue and what we are doing to stop it again given the perception that this type of action might compromise user security we are constantly building new features to improve the experience on tiktok in this case we had been working to address the problem of spam and incidents where users sometimes post the same comments on hundreds of videos our technology allowed us to identify users who were copying comments and placing them over and over in the comment section for different videos we took this as a signal that the user had an agenda such as promoting themselves to gain followers or trolling other users we launched an anti spam feature so that we could quickly detect spam and improve the experience for our community this feature was added in the ios version of the app released on may 22 from a technical point of view this anti bot defense technology performed a string matching validation from the clipboard its only function was to validate whether matched text inputted into the application came from the clipboard there was no collection of any data on the clipboard simply a validation against data input into the app like hashing validation in layman s terms the anti spam program never sent user data off the user s device nonetheless we understand that the notification had the unintended consequence of making it appear as though we might be doing more with the feature last week we sent an update to the app store removing this feature and it has been resolved in version 16 6 1 of the tiktok app which appeared in the apple app store on june 27 as always we encourage all of our users to update their apps to the latest version the anti spam feature was never added to the android version of the app and we are now addressing the issue of spam in both versions through other technology that does not involve the clipboard the anti spam feature that was operational from may 22 june 27 is similar to other types of features that dozens if not hundreds of different apps have that triggered notifications from ios 14 at the same time we appreciate that it would have been better to avoid adding a feature that would raise questions about tiktok s access to the clipboard in any scenario particularly so shortly after we had worked to eliminate this type of access for a different feature we also understand that while many apps are triggering this type of notification often for innocuous reasons users have legitimate questions about what companies are doing with data we fully accept that and strive to be a leader in the industry not only working every day to protect the safety and privacy of our users but also being transparent and forthright about our practices with this in mind i am leading a sprint initiative to conduct thorough ongoing app security assessments remediations verifications and pre deployment tests and validation prevention efforts this is the highest priority for the team and we have the full support of our executive management team to conduct our analysis and take action we will have a team of engineers fully dedicated to this project further we are conducting a review of our feature release processes to help limit the possibility that such issues might arise in the future when we roll out new features as part of this we ve undertaken a full review of all clipboard issues to consider other possible scenarios where this could occur in particular we looked at scenarios where there could be any type of clipboard access action that was not directly initiated by the user for example pasting information into tiktok would be a user initiated action and it brings value to the user over the next several days we will work with our third party partners to complete that review and confirm that no other such scenarios exist we will report back on our findings shortly we re committed to building an app that respects the privacy of our users and to being more transparent with our community we ll continue to update you about ways we are improving tiktok and later this year we ll open our transparency center to give experts a behind the scenes look at how we keep people safe and protect their privacy security is a job that is never finished but i can tell you we ll continue to aggressively build an experience that respects and protects our

screen to give people more context about covid 19 related links when they are about to share them the notification will help people understand the recency and source of the content before they share it it will also direct people to our covid 19 information center to ensure people have access to credible information about covid 19 from global health authorities along those lines we want to ensure we dont slow the spread of information from credible health authorities so content posted by government health authorities and recognized global health organizations like the world health organization will not have this notification originally published on june 25 2020 at 8 00am pt when we ask people what kind of news they want to see on facebook they continually tell us they want information that is timely and credible thats why in 2018 we added the context button which provides information about the sources of articles in news feed today were starting to globally roll out a notification screen that will let people know when news articles they are about to share are more than 90 days old to ensure people have the context they need to make informed decisions about what to share on facebook the notification screen will appear when people click the share button on articles older than 90 days but will allow people to continue sharing if they decide an article is still relevant over the past several months our internal research found that the timeliness of an article is an important piece of context that helps people decide what to read trust and share news publishers in particular have expressed concerns about older stories being shared on social media as current news which can misconstrue the state of current events some news publishers have already taken steps to address this on their own websites by prominently labeling older articles to prevent outdated news from being used in misleading ways fb iframe widget display block fb iframe widget fluid desktop fb

gauge the content you like as well as the content you d prefer to skip what factors contribute to for you on tiktok the for you feed reflects preferences unique to each user the system recommends content by ranking videos based on a combination of factors starting from interests you express as a new user and adjusting for things you indicate you re not interested in too to form your personalized for you feed recommendations are based on a number of factors including things like user interactions such as the videos you like or share accounts you follow comments you post and content you create video information which might include details like captions sounds and hashtags device and account settings like your language preference country setting and device type these factors are included to make sure the system is optimized for performance but they receive lower weight in the recommendation system relative to other data points we measure since users don t actively express these as preferences all these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user a strong indicator of interest such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end would receive greater weight than a weak indicator such as whether the video s viewer and creator are both in the same country videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user s interest in a piece of content and delivered to each unique for you feed while a video is likely to receive more views if posted by an account that has more followers by virtue of that account having built up a larger follower base neither follower count nor whether the account has had previous high performing videos are direct factors in the recommendation system curating your personalized for you feedgetting startedhow can you possibly know what you like on tiktok when you ve only just started on the app to help kick things off we invite new users to select categories of interest like pets or travel to help tailor recommendations to their preferences this allows the app to develop an initial feed and it will start to polish recommendations based on your interactions with an early set of videos for users who don t select categories we start by offering you a generalized feed of popular videos to get the ball rolling your first set of likes comments and replays will initiate an early round of recommendations as the system begins to learn more about your content tastes finding more of what you re interested inevery new interaction helps the system learn about your interests and suggest content so the best way to curate your for you feed is to simply use and enjoy the app over time your for you feed should increasingly be able to surface recommendations that are relevant to your interests your for you feed isn t only shaped by your engagement through the feed itself when you decide to follow new accounts for example that action will help refine your recommendations too as will exploring hashtags sounds effects and trending topics on the discover tab all of these are ways to tailor your experience and invite new categories of content into your feed seeing less of what you re not interested intiktok is home to creators with many different interests and perspectives and sometimes you may come across a video that isn t quite to your taste just like you can long press to add a video to your favorites you can simply long press on a video and tap not interested to indicate that you don t care for a particular video you can also choose to hide videos from a given creator or made with a certain sound or report a video that seems out of line with our guidelines all these actions contribute to future recommendations in your for you feed addressing the challenges of recommendation enginesone of the inherent challenges with recommendation engines is that they can inadvertently limit your experience what is sometimes referred to as a filter bubble by optimizing for personalization and relevance there is a risk of presenting an increasingly homogenous stream of videos this is a concern we take seriously as we maintain our recommendation system interrupting repetitive patternsto keep your for you feed interesting and varied our recommendation system works to intersperse diverse types of content along with those you already know you love for example your for you feed generally won t show two videos in a row made with the same sound or by the same creator we also don t recommend duplicated content content you ve already seen before or any content that s considered spam however you might be recommended a video that s been well received by other users who share similar interests diversifying recommendations diversity is essential to maintaining a thriving global community and it brings the many corners of tiktok closer together to that end sometimes you may come across a video in your feed that doesn t appear to be relevant to your expressed interests or have amassed a huge number of likes this is an important and intentional component of our approach to recommendation bringing a diversity of videos into your for you feed gives you additional opportunities to stumble upon new content categories discover new creators and experience new perspectives and ideas as you scroll through your feed by offering different videos from time to time the system is also able to get a better sense of what s popular among a wider range of audiences to help provide other tiktok users a great experience too our goal is to find balance between suggesting content that s relevant to you while also helping you find content and creators that encourage you to explore experiences you might not otherwise see safeguarding the viewing experienceour recommendation system is also designed with safety as a consideration reviewed content found to depict things like graphic medical procedures or legal consumption of regulated goods for example which may be shocking if surfaced as a recommended video to a general audience that hasn t opted in to such content may not be eligible for recommendation similarly videos that have just been uploaded or are under review and spam content such as videos seeking to artificially increase traffic also may be ineligible for recommendation into anyone s for you feed improving for youdeveloping and maintaining tiktok s recommendation system is a continuous process as we work to refine accuracy adjust models and reassess the factors and weights that contribute to recommendations based on feedback from users research and data we are committed to further research and investment as we work to build in even more protections against the engagement bias that can affect any recommendation system this work spans many teams including product safety and security whose work helps improve the relevance of the recommendation system and its accuracy in suggesting content and categories you re more likely to enjoy ultimately your for you feed is powered by your feedback the system is designed to continuously improve correct and learn from your own engagement with the platform to produce personalized recommendations that we hope inspire creativity and bring joy with every refresh of your for you feed note at the tiktok transparency center in los angeles invited experts will have the opportunity to learn how our algorithm operates along with reviewing tiktok source code which will be made available at the center for testing and evaluation"},{"id":"146880e3-f27a-4278-81c6-ba1d807b0ce1","platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video","date":"2020-06-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Product

view count display issue post-mortem","text":"by seth melnick and somar musatwo weeks ago our systems encountered an issue that caused significant delays in data consumption while this delay was ongoing a user who was considering adding a hashtag to a post they were composing would be shown a view count result of 0 views even if there were billions of views this display issue which impacted a total of 225 611 unique hashtags but could have impacted any searched hashtag was due to inefficiencies in our data stream flushing service design today we want to clarify exactly what happened how it happened and why it happened we ll go into details on how our system returns information on hashtags to users what we did to fix the issue in the short term and how we re going to ensure that this problem doesn t happen again how did we learn about the issue on may 28th 2020 we learned through user reports that view counts on a large number of hashtags including georgefloyd and blacklivesmatter were showing 0 views in the compose screen where users prepare their post before uploading what did we find out upon hearing about the issue we began exploring the two paths that would be most likely to cause this error 1 an issue in the code or 2 a data loading or lagging issue we found that 1 the code was bug free and provided eventual consistency 2 there was a lag in the data stream that counts the number of times a video is viewed what did the data lag look like when we say we had a lag in a data stream we mean some data was so backed up that it needed to be queued to be consumed called normally we calculate the computing power needed so as to consume the queued data with little to no delay or lag time in this case as shown in the above graph the queued unprocessed hashtag data piled to some millions in scale which still needed to be processed one by one causing a lot of data to not be able to be pushed online back to the user eventually the server might have returned a value to the user but it would have taken several days at which point the view count it displayed would also have been out of date in the above graph you can also see several peaks and valleys to the data consumption slopes while this might appear as though the issue was resolving itself every few days this is actually a self protection mechanism of the data stream infrastructure when the lagging is too devastating to the data stream it will decide to abandon all the lagged data and start all over again which is why we see a regular peak and then suddenly the lag would fall down to 0 this caused the lag to be longer why did the hashtag count view data pile up to understand how the hashtag count view data piled up we need to look at how hashtag count view searches work under normal circumstances and how the data is consumed if the system is working correctly the request for the hashtag works through a server proxy and a data stream flushing service the process of the data stream system consuming the queued data that keeps the entire system moving quickly ideally this will return a value immediately generally speaking a one to one mapping check that includes a data flushing service is always much faster than a thorough search including indexing matching ranking etc in this case and for a period of time the data flushing failed which caused the data lag and the system to assume there was no value to return or 0 views what happened that caused the data flushing system to fail the system is supposed to support global hashtag flushing and it flushes every attribute of a hashtag nearly 150 times one country a time this is unnecessary because most of the attributes stay the same among all countries eg plaintext hashtag ids and can cause lags like the one that caused this issue so how did we fix it once our engineering team ascertained that the issue was caused by the data stream flushing not working we fell back to a thorough search procedure to normalize the query and back search the hashtag library this meant essentially cutting out the mapping data and the data stream flushing and focusing on pulling the data in plaintext and then communicating between the server proxy and the hashtag library to get the proper hashtag id and therefore view count it looks something like this as mentioned above this method is slower but in this case it was effective in more quickly accurately pulling the view counts for hashtags in the compose screen unfortunately switching to plaintext didn t solve the problem for all other case changed version of a hashtag this meant that if you attempted to put in georgefloyd or blacklivesmatter you would see a 0 view value this happens because we store all of our plaintext hashtags in lowercase how did we solve the uppercase issue we solved the upper and multi case issue by normalizing all plaintext case sensitive permutations to lowercase before our system counted them in the hashtag library and then doing a final check and accounting before returning to the user it looks something like this so now the server has multiple checkpoints where it normalizes the plaintext query entered by the user to lowercase before sending it to be counted from the hashtag library then checks if the result returned by the recommendation side has a corresponding lowercase version this helps ensure that every time a user enters a hashtag in the compose screen they are seeing every view of that hashtag what s next we ve explored the design of our data stream flushing and found inefficiencies we re upgrading the design to eradicate this issue specifically the new system will recognize identical attributes and not flush redundantly so if an attribute is the same among all countries we will flush it only once instead of 150 times per country this will allow us to process faster than before while using far less computing resources meaning we shouldn t see a lag issue like this again moreover as an extra layer of precaution we will be increasing our monitoring which will notify us of delays in data stream processing early on and help us correct these issues as they arise"},{"id":"8d49f2f1-cc13-4fa9-8081-f4765a1be5d6","platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/bringing-payments-to-whatsapp-for-people-and-small-businesses-in-brazil","date":"2020-06-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Bringing

in the us originally published on june 4 2020 at 9 00am pt we want to help people better understand whos behind the news they see on facebook several months ago we announced our plan to label media outlets that are wholly or partially under the editorial control of their government and today were starting to apply labels to those state controlled media outlets were providing greater transparency into these publishers because they combine the influence of a media organization with the strategic backing of a state and we believe people should know if the news they read is coming from a publication that may be under the influence of a government and to ensure were equally transparent when it comes to paid content from these publishers we will begin labeling ads from these publishers later this year state controlled media outlets rarely advertise in the us nevertheless later this summer we will begin blocking ads from these outlets in the us out of an abundance of caution to provide an extra layer of protection against various types of foreign influence in the public debate ahead of the november 2020 election in the us where the labels will be shown the labels will appear globally in the ad library page view on pages and in the page transparency section in the us the label will also start to appear on posts in news feed over the course of the next week later this summer well apply the label to ads from state controlled media outlets starting with a few outlets and adding more over time our policy criteria to inform our policy criteria we consulted more than 65 experts around the world specializing in media governance and human rights and development the input we received from these organizations was crucial to understanding the different ways and degrees to which governments exert editorial control over media entities we know that governments continue to use funding mechanisms to control media but this alone doesnt tell the full story thats why our definition of state controlled media extends beyond just assessing financial control or ownership and includes an assessment of editorial control exerted by a government based on these consultations and research we developed our own policy criteria to determine whether a publisher is wholly or partially under the editorial control of a government we look at several factors that may indicate editorial control by a government including mission statement mandate and or public reporting on how the organization defines and accomplishes its journalistic mission ownership structure such as information on owners stakeholders board members management government appointees in leadership positions and disclosure of direct or indirect ownership by entities or individuals holding elected office editorial guidelines such as transparency around sources of content and independence and diversity of sources information about newsroom leadership and staff sources of funding and revenue governance and accountability mechanisms such as correctional policies procedure for complaints external assessments and oversight boards if we determine that there are enough protections in place to ensure editorial independence we will not apply the label publishers looking to prove their independence must be able to demonstrate at least a statute in the host country that clearly protects the editorial independence of the organization established procedures processes and protections at the media organization to ensure editorial independence an assessment by an independent credible external organization finding that the statute has in fact been complied with and established procedures have been followed we also consider country specific factors including press freedom and we consult open source research conducted by academics and leading experts if an organization believes we have applied the label in error they can submit an appeal through the appeal they can provide additional documentation which we will review against our definition as we roll these labels out to more publishers over time we welcome feedback and will continue to consult with experts and refine our approach"},{"id":"8c37048c-9496-4ea1-8e2a-ece4cc387f9a","platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/introducing-manage-activity/","date":"2020-06-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product

performing live are permitted the greater the number of full length recorded tracks in a video the more likely it may be limited more below on what we mean by limited for that reason shorter clips of

are places where it is not yet available so if your video includes recorded music it may not be available for use in those locations people also have access to a library of custom music and sound

explanations or clarifications in situations where the risks of harm associated with a tweet are less severe but where people may still be confused or misled by the content this will make it easier to find facts and make informed decisions about what people see on twitter new labels and warnings during active conversations about disputed issues it can be helpful to see additional context from trusted sources earlier this year we introduced a new label for tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media similar labels will now appear on tweets containing potentially harmful misleading information related to covid 19 this will also apply to tweets sent before today these labels will link to a twitter curated page or external trusted source containing additional information on the claims made within the tweet depending on the propensity for harm and type of misleading information warnings may also be applied to a tweet these warnings will inform people that the information in the tweet conflicts with public health experts guidance before they view it while false or misleading content can take many different forms we will take action based on three broad categories misleading information statements or assertions that have been confirmed to be false or misleading by subject matter experts such as public health authorities disputed claims statements or assertions in which the accuracy truthfulness or credibility of the claim is contested or unknown unverified claims information which could be true or false that is unconfirmed at the time it is shared we will continue to introduce new labels to provide context around different types of unverified claims and rumors as needed how will we identify these tweets our teams are using and improving on internal systems to proactively monitor content related to covid 19 these systems help ensure were not amplifying tweets with these warnings or labels and detecting the high visibility content quickly additionally well continue to rely on trusted partners to identify content that is likely to result in offline harm given the dynamic situation we will prioritize review and labeling of content that could lead to increased exposure or transmission well learn a lot as we use these new labels and are open to adjusting as we explore labeling different types of misleading information this process is ongoing and well work to make sure these and other labels and warnings show up across twitter embedded tweets and tweets viewed by people not logged into twitter may still appear without a label

news there are a few factors that determine whether a fact check information panel will appear for any given search most important there must be a relevant fact check article available from an eligible publisher and in order to match a viewers needs with the information we provide fact checks will only show when people search for a specific claim for example if someone searches for did a tornado hit los angeles they might see a relevant fact check article but if they search for a more general query like tornado they may not all fact check articles must also comply with our community guidelines and viewers can send feedback to our team our fact check information panel relies on an open network of third party publishers and leverages the claimreview tagging system all u s publishers are welcome to participate as long as they follow the publicly available claimreview standards and are either a verified signatory of the international fact checking networks ifcn code of principles or are an authoritative publisher over a dozen u s publishers are participating today including the dispatch factcheck org politifact and the washington post fact checker and we encourage more publishers and fact checkers to explore using claimreview in addition to this roll out youtube will provide 1m through the google news initiative to the ifcn to bolster fact checking and verification efforts across the world this follows googles efforts to support the ecosystem in the midst of the challenging covid 19 environment and we ll be looking for more ways to support the fact check ecosystem in the future as always it will take some time for our systems to fully ramp up our systems will become more accurate and over time we ll roll this feature out to more countries we are committed to our responsibility to protect the youtube community and expanding our fact check information panels is one of the many steps we are taking to raise up authoritative sources provide relevant and authoritative context to our users and continue to reduce the spread of harmful misinformation on youtube related topics products and

learned that reddit chat facilitates fascinating discussion and that reddit communities are a captivating window into humanity human interests and needs some reddit communities are large some are small but each community on reddit has its own requirements when it comes to real time communication today were excited to roll out subreddit and one to one chat to all users and communities years of

Behind the Tweets","text":"three months ago we launched topics to make it easier to find the most interesting conversations happening on twitter about the things you love since then people have asked to learn more about how topics work so we want to provide some background on how specific topics are selected the process to find the best tweets for you about these topics and how we seek to highlight healthy conversations how topics are chosen right now there are roughly 1 000 topics you can follow via the topic browser which will then show you tweets about those topics in your home timeline and were adding new topics almost every week we add new topics based on the volume and health of conversations happening on twitter we start by looking at the volume of conversation on twitter how much people are tweeting retweeting replying and liking tweets about that topic the more conversation the more likely it will be evaluated for inclusion in our next batch of available topics topics reflect the broader lasting conversations people have about the events people and things they discuss once weve identified a new topic we then shift our focus to identifying the most relevant tweets finding the most relevant tweets on a topic to find the full set of tweets about a topic we use a combination of methods including looking at the text of tweets as well as signals generated by machine learning solutions highlighting what tweets might be about at times our teams and external partners may also help source accounts to be included in certain topics to find the most relevant tweets we start by identifying the people on twitter who are most interested in a given topic using using a combination of machine learning curation and keywords this could mean they tweet a lot about the topic or interact a lot with tweets about the topic from there we find the tweets that are most interesting to those people using additional algorithms that look at many signals from those fan accounts including what types of content they engage with or specific accounts that are most relevant our systems check to confirm these tweets are relevant to the topic by looking at a series of related keywords keeping topics healthy a healthy conversation about topics is one where you want and feel safe to participate weve implemented a number of protections so that the conversations included in a topic should be healthy and free from abuse this includes working to not recommend tweets for a topic if the engagement is manipulated or spammy we look at a number of underlying signals including how others interact with both the tweet and the author things like reports blocks and whether people have dismissed similar recommendations by clicking show less often or muting closely related keywords these are just some of the signals we use when ranking and filtering the group of tweets until we have a set we are confident recommending for that topic and to be clear tweets that criticize satirize or disagree within a topic are a natural part of a healthy conversation and are eligible for inclusion these protections are on top of all of the health protections weve already put in place for other parts of twitter in addition to the processes described above there are quality assurance checks with a globally distributed team of people to confirm topics are accurately highlighting relevant and healthy conversations if topics are unfollowed frequently or tweets within topics are reported often these could be signals that those topic tweets might not be pertinent and healthy if this is happening we may pause the topic temporarily we know people are trusting us by following topics and that topics offer additional amplification to tweets so we want to make sure were amplifying relevant healthy conversations personalizing the topic for you when you follow a topic the tweets you see about that topic in your timeline are personalized your past activity like your tweets and tweets youve liked replied to or retweeted are used to identify the tweets you ll find most interesting also if you engage more with one topic like dogs versus another topic like cats well show you more of the dog topic sorry cat lovers to wrap it up lets use one of my favorite topics blackpink as an example for the blackpink topic accounts regularly tweeting about and engaging with the kpop band generally or a specific band member like a fan account are found from there tweets that would be interesting to those fan accounts are gathered using the method described above throughout this process our systems are at work ensuring we are surfacing the conversations you want to see from that narrowed pool depending on what might be most interesting to you say which band member you tweet about or reply to tweets about the most you may see a tweet about lisa or jennie after all that the best blackpink topic tweet for you is ready to be shown in your home timeline this is just the start well keep working to improve topics we hope you like it if you dont see a topic you want to follow yet dont worry were adding new topics almost every week topics are available in english japanese spanish portuguese arabic and korean wed love to hear how you are liking topics do the topics you follow show interesting tweets when you follow a topic do you see too many or too few related tweets well keep tweaking our systems to make topics better you can give feedback on topic tweets by tapping the down arrow on the tweet and choosing show less often updated july 2 2020 to elaborate on how tweets about a topic are discovered and clarify that for certain topics our teams and external partners may help source accounts to be included"},{"id":"e8a3c5a8-67e8-4ec3-9979-d7c7f5efedf4","platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/freeze-frame-with-tiktok-hand-gestures","date":"2020-01-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Freeze

challenging road ahead its also an enormously disorienting time with news changing by the minute and as we navigate this inside of linkedin we keep turning to our editorial team to help figure out which way is up dan roth linkedins editor in chief and his team of 65 editors located across the globe and working 24 hours a day are singularly focused on making sure what we publish is timely and accurate keeping up with real time updates of high quality content is something we take seriously and is our number one priority during this unprecedented time so many companies are pointing to linkedin as a source of truth and in a time when information is spreading so quickly and so erroneously im proud of our team when we hired dan almost nine years ago and started talking about adding an editorial voice to the linkedin platform we had no idea where wed be today we had huge ideas and big plans but wondered if what we were sketching on the white board would actually become a reality were we dreaming too big does our audience want this from us we weren t and you do our members are turning to linkedin to find news they can trust and we take this responsibility seriously particularly in times like this we are using many tools and products to make sure were bringing you the most relevant and accurate content as i mentioned last week weve launched a special report

right audiences we have human editors because having experienced journalists working with and alongside algorithms is a better solution than having either on their own our editors have the unique ability to put news and views in context we like to say that the story starts with the reader in addition to making sure our coronavirus coverage is reliable our editors are spending a lot of time listening to our members to our influencers to you what are our members talking about what are they interested in were listening and surfacing trending topics and issues our members are sharing perspectives and advice on topics including remote working social distancing crisis management business continuity online learning and collaboration in record numbers our members are also talking about small business owners frontline workers jobseekers these stories give affected members a platform and resources to navigate their specific crises another example this running tracker of corporate responses has been invaluable for business leaders and employees alike we are also tracking trends in the conversation for example france has the highest percentage of posts discussing covid 19 while brazil has the fastest growth in covid 19 discussions stay tuned as we continue to look for insights in the data to help provide our members as much clarity as possible in such an uncertain situation investing in our editorial team was a decision we made years ago and as ive heard from members and business leaders how much the content they are curating has helped during this time im glad

performance advertising strategy our first focus has been to drive app discovery for people while supporting app developers in growing their user acquisition and increasing their return on investment our second area of focus is on driving action to websites we are exploring the development of ad products that help people find relevant information and products or guide them to take action on a website these elements could unlock the ability for us to enable advertisers to drive discovery of goods and services eventually supporting our broader commerce opportunities we are no stranger to the new platform standards influencing digital advertising such as apples app tracking transparency enforcement that began in april these shifts in the industry are an opportunity for us to move quickly and help our partners navigate these changes as effectively as possible we continue to build our products with these privacy focused developments at the core of all we do app installs building upon our progress we made significant progress to delivering a performant app installs objective which helps advertisers drive installs to their app s with a privacy led mindset we heavily invested in supporting skadnetwork to enable post app tracking transparency user acquisition our work here allowed us to open up over 30 more inventory and scale on ios after enabling privacy preserved measurement we then quickly launched support of view through attribution and sk campaign id management features in twitter ads manager in addition to updated optimization models supporting our partners through these changes is not limited to investment in skadnetwork alone we continued to iterate off of our rebuilt foundation launching new ad format improvements to reduce download friction

relevant goods and services that are important to them if twitter is to become a place for commerce discovery will need to be effective and accessible in order to make this all work we also need to build the right organic tools and resources for businesses which we are doing in our recent work for twitter for professionals all of these advances have put us in a strong position for the next phase of performance advertising on twitter while this is an exciting milestone it is still an early step we have more work ahead of us and are looking forward to continuing to share our progress source

february 8 2021 new year new blog post since we last shared an update weve built on our recent carousel ads launch and we concluded two crucial product milestones the rebuilds of our app installs and website traffic objectives these rebuilds are focused on getting our fundamentals right and include improvements across five areas campaign management quality supply ad formats optimization and measurement our commitment to developing the critical tools that advertisers need to launch campaigns and drive customer acquisition is working and we are excited to share more about the progress we

than before as part of this rebuild we redesigned several of our most popular formats to drive higher engagement increased mobile app impressions by 80 1 improved prediction and measurement and developed a faster and more intuitive campaign creation experience heres a look at the changes we have made enhanced creative formats in addition to our recent new and improved carousels announcement we also made improvements to twitter app cards making them even more engaging than before by adding more context and information such as app ratings app price and download details all of which help us better serve up and coming apps by giving them more credibility this has led to a 8 88 install per impression improvement2 improved prediction and supply we launched a combination of prediction bid optimization supply and supply quality improvements to deliver more stability and performance we also upgraded our infrastructure and how our ad serving works within the twitter timeline which has resulted in a significant number of impressions that app install advertisers are now winning in our auction easier campaign setup and management we improved aspects of the ads manager experience to be

driving website outcomes weve been hard at work improving formats measurement and optimization models to increase click to land rates and reduce reporting discrepancies between twitter reporting and third party reporting as the industry shifts away from using third party cookies to determine if an ad resulted in a site visit we improved the twitter website tag javascript version by developing a first party click id parameter twitter click id provides a reliable method to measure the people who visited a site after clicking on a twitter ad and reduces measurement discrepancies giving advertisers better data and a long term measurement solution in a cookie less advertising world how it works when someone clicks on a website ad the twitter click ids unique identifier will be appended automatically in the url when the person lands on the website and the twitter pixel fires this id will be captured sent to twitter and used to attribute the site visit to the click based on our test results we have seen a 10x increase in site visits3 reported in twitter ads manager we also upgraded our conversion optimization model improving campaigns that optimize for site visits our system is now better at identifying people who are more likely to visit your website in recent testing we observed a median increase in click to land rate of 26 and a significant decrease in cost per site visit4 in twitter ads manager additionally we made improvements to the website card format including better navigation to a full screen browser reduced loading time for websites and improved usability of media controls all of which resulted in a click to land rate improvement of 8 5 whats next our focus is on making it easier and more efficient than ever to advertise on twitter helping advertisers reach a full funnel marketing approach from the top down these products can help marketers take their launches and campaigns and extend them into always on media plans that may ultimately

businesses on twitter to run advertising campaigns that help them effectively reach their goals whether thats driving people to websites or to download mobile apps we have been hard at work on a roadmap that will help us deliver better performance at a greater scale and establish a more efficient performance driven advertising business on twitter weve made a lot of progress in the last year which include rebuilding our ad platform architecture which improved the state of our systems and reinforced the foundation of twitter s ad business launching our advanced mobile measurement amm program to give advertisers enhanced measurement of lifetime value releasing the new tweet composer to help enable faster creative development and iteration adding support of skadnetwork apples attribution service to attribute installs and provide campaign reporting for ios 14 improving our advertising algorithms such as the launch of learning period which allows our prediction models to learn and optimize campaign delivery this investment in performance advertising also includes expanding the capabilities of our ad formats to enable advertisers with more options to show and tell their brand story while providing a more intuitive engaging experience for people on twitter we recently redesigned the video controls on our video website cards to make it easier for people to navigate and launched improvements to our app cards and today were excited to share the global release of the new and improved carousel ads now available to all carousel ad examples carousel ads are designed to help drive better performance by providing a more immersive and interactive experience for consumers to engage with as well as enable future opportunities within our mobile app and website performance objectives we are excited to share that this ad format is now available to all advertisers globally carousel ads are made up of two to six horizontally swipeable images or videos that drive people to an app or website any advertiser can create carousel ads via tweet composer in ads manager or via the ads api and is able to use them either organically or promoted the carousel ad format also includes an edge to edge design 3rd party measurement reporting accessibility support and new reporting features such as swipes within the carousel and breakdowns to measure individual carousel card performance we are encouraged by the strong results we saw during our beta testing for website carousels we saw on average a 15 increase in click through rate relative to single asset formats and for app carousels we saw on average a 24 increase in installs per impression relative to single asset formats we expect these results to change in general availability and to vary across different regions platforms and industries however it is a positive sign as we release this format globally and continue to invest in performance products whats next this is an early step in our journey to build a more effective performance advertising business we are increasing our investment across various initiatives including updates to our mobile app objectives such as stronger bidding and optimization options enhancements to the twitter website tag that aim to drive up the accuracy of key advertiser campaign metrics such as return on ad spend and improved creative advertising

are more comfortable talking about what s happening when they can choose who can reply weve seen people use these settings to have conversations that weren t really possible before starting today everyone will be able to use these settings so unwanted replies dont get in the way of meaningful conversations heres how it works before you tweet choose who can reply with three options 1 everyone standard twitter and the default setting 2 only people you follow or 3 only people you mention tweets with the latter two settings will be labeled and the reply icon will be grayed out for people who cant reply people who cant reply will still be able to view retweet retweet with comment share and like these tweets since we started testing this in may people have used it to host interviews and panels share whats on their mind and make announcements weve learned a lot from usage feedback interviews and surveys these settings help some people feel safer and could lead to more meaningful conversations while still allowing people to see different points of view heres more on what people shared with us these settings help some people feel safer people tell us they feel more comfortable tweeting and more protected from spam and abuse problematic repliers aren t finding another way these settings prevented an average of three potentially abusive replies while only adding one potentially abusive retweet with comment and we didnt see any uptick in unwanted direct messages people who face abuse find these settings helpful those who have submitted abuse reports are 3x more likely to use these settings its a new method to block out noise 60 of people who used this during the test didnt use mute or block the change could lead to more meaningful conversations on twitter people are sharing more of their thoughts tweets using these settings about topics like black lives matter and covid 19 are on average longer than those that dont use these settings some people use these settings to have more sensitive conversations about politics and social issues those with a lot of followers use these settings to share more feelings opinions and personal news people still can see various points of view research shows people understand replies are limited on these tweets people more frequently look for additional commentary when replies are limited the new retweets with comments timeline is visited 4x more often on tweets using these settings differing views can still be shared with retweets with comments which sometimes reach a larger audience than the original tweet several times we saw more likes and views on a retweet with comment than on the original tweet even though the original tweet author had more followers twitter serves the public conversation so its important for people to be able to see different perspectives well keep working on making it easier for people to find the entire discussion through retweets with comments also were trying out a new label to make it more obvious when these conversation settings are used well continue to update these tweet settings based on your feedback in the next few months were planning to add an option to invite more people to the conversation after it starts clear notifications for when youre invited to join a conversation using these settings and more ways to see the entire discussion everyone can now use these settings on twitter for ios and android as well as twitter com you know what to do me with what you

informed decisions about what they see and how they engage on twitter twitter provides an unmatched way to connect with and directly speak to public officials and representatives this direct line of communication with leaders and officials has helped to democratize political discourse and increase transparency and accountability we also took steps to protect that discourse because we believe political reach should be earned not bought in 2019 we banned all state backed media advertising and political advertising from twitter today were expanding the types of political accounts we label we will add new labels to the following categories of twitter accounts accounts of key government officials including foreign ministers institutional entities ambassadors official spokespeople and key diplomatic leaders at this time our focus is on senior officials and entities who are the official voice of the state abroad accounts belonging to state affiliated media entities their editors in chief and or their senior staff how do we define government accounts for these new labels our focus is on senior officials and entities that are the voice of the nation state abroad specifically the account categories listed above labels will only be applied to accounts from the countries represented in the five permanent members of the un security council china france russian federation the united kingdom and the united states for transparency and practicality we are starting with a limited and clearly defined group of countries before expanding to a wider range of countries in the future we believe this is an important step so that when people see an account discussing geopolitical issues from another country they have context on its national affiliation and are better informed about who they represent at this time we re not labeling the personal accounts of heads of state as these accounts enjoy widespread name recognition media attention and public awareness institutional accounts associated with their offices that changeover depending on election results will be labeled however in general we re focused on those within the respective administrations underneath the head of state that offer its policy perspective abroad how do we define state affiliated media accounts for these new labels state affiliated media is defined as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources direct or indirect political pressures and or control over production and distribution unlike independent media state affiliated media frequently use their news coverage as a means to advance a political agenda we believe that people have the right to know when a media account is affiliated directly or indirectly with a state actor state financed media organizations with editorial independence like the bbc in the uk or npr in the us for example will not be labeled as part of the development of this process we consulted with a number of expert groups including members of the digital and human rights advisory group in twitters trust safety council we will also no longer amplify state affiliated media accounts or their tweets through our recommendation systems including on the home timeline notifications and search government accounts listed in category one are not affected by this change to offer even more context to the public clicking the labels on both categories of accounts directs people to an article explaining the policy and referring them to the twitter transparency report for additional information notification and appeals process well notify any account thats labeled and if the account owner believes weve made a mistake they can reach out to us directly next steps we plan to continue expanding this approach to additional countries over time and look forward to providing additional updates as those plans take shape"},{"id":"4ed0cf30-5d6e-44f4-8447-bb82ac6c66d8","platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/twitter-announces-promoted-trend-spotlight-goes-global","date":"2020-01-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Video","Ads","Brands","Product","Marketing"],"title":"Twitter

more inclusive for the disabled community creating a dedicated team to focus on greater accessibility tooling and advocacy across all of our products so what are we doing to accelerate this necessary change were introducing two new teams were building to focus on this work 1 the accessibility center of excellence and 2 the experience accessibility team which will focus specifically on the features and products on twitter the accessibility center for excellence will set goals drive progress consult and partner with groups across our core business functions to help make aspects of twitter more

around image cropping and changes to come","text":"were always striving to work in a way thats transparent and easy to understand but we dont always get this right recent conversation around our photo cropping methods brought this to the forefront and over the past week weve been reviewing the way we test for bias in our systems and discussing ways we can improve how we display images on twitter so while theres a lot still to do today we want to share how were developing a solution for each of these areas how we tested our system we tested the existing machine learning ml system that decides how to crop images before bringing it to twitter but we shouldve published how we did it at the same time so the analysis could be externally reproducible this was an oversight the image cropping system relies on saliency which predicts where people might look first for our initial bias analysis we tested pairwise preference between two demographic groups white black white indian white asian and male female in each trial we combined two faces into the same image with their order randomized then computed the saliency map over the combined image then we located the maximum of the saliency map and recorded which demographic category it landed on we repeated this 200 times for each pair of demographic categories and evaluated the frequency of preferring one over the other while our analyses to date havent shown racial or gender bias we recognize that the way we automatically crop photos means there is a potential for harm we shouldve done a better job of anticipating this possibility when we were first designing and building this product we are currently conducting additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing are committed to sharing our findings and are exploring ways to open source our analysis so that others can help keep us accountable changes to come we are prioritizing work to decrease our reliance on ml based image cropping by giving people more visibility and control over what their images will look like in a tweet weve started exploring different options to see what will work best across the wide range of images people tweet every day we hope that giving people more choices for image cropping and previewing what theyll look like in the tweet composer may help reduce the risk of harm going forward we are committed to following the what you see is what you get principles of design meaning quite simply the photo you see in the tweet composer is what it will look like in the tweet there may be some exceptions to this such as photos that arent a standard size or are really long or wide in those cases well need to experiment with how we present the photo in a way that doesnt lose the creators intended focal point or take away from the integrity of the photo bias in ml systems is an industry wide issue and one were committed to improving on twitter were aware of our responsibility and want to work towards making it easier for everyone to understand how our systems work while no system can be completely free of bias well continue to minimize bias through deliberate and thorough analysis and share updates as we progress in this space theres lots of work to do but were grateful for everyone who spoke up and shared feedback on this were eager to improve and will share additional updates as we have

portability tools since then weve had conversations with stakeholders around the world from the uk and germany to brazil and singapore to get feedback about what data should be portable and how to ensure that we protect privacy when enabling data transfers weve learned from our conversations with policymakers regulators academics advocates and others that real world use cases and tools will help drive policy discussions forward thats why were developing new products that take into account the feedback weve received and will help drive data portability policies forward by giving people and experts a tool to assess for almost a decade weve enabled people to download their information from facebook the photo transfer tool were starting to roll out today is based on code developed through our participation in the open source data transfer project and will first be available to people in ireland with worldwide availability planned for the first half of 2020 people can access

be encrypted and people will be asked to enter their password before a transfer is initiated we are currently testing this tool so we will continue refining it based on feedback from people using it as well as from our conversations with stakeholders we want to build practical portability solutions people can trust and use effectively to foster that trust people and online services need clear rules about what kinds of data should be portable and who is responsible for protecting that data as it moves to different services we hope this product can help advance conversations on the privacy questions we identified in our white paper we know we cant do this alone so we encourage other companies to join the data transfer project to expand options for people and continue to push data

tools for managing difficult emotions","text":"at pinterest we measure the success of our product not just by what people are doing but by what people are feeling a lot of technology today prioritizes behavioral outcomes does it get clicks lets do more of it we believe its important to prioritize emotional outcomes everything we do is in service of helping people feel more inspired so when we noticed people in especially low moments were coming to pinterest to try to feel a little better we wanted to do more to meet them in whatever mindset theyre in thats why earlier this year we launched a more compassionate search experience with activities people can do to improve their mood we developed it with emotional health experts at brainstorm the stanford lab for mental health innovation and with guidance from vibrant emotional health and the national suicide prevention lifeline these experts continue to help us better understand different emotional states including the unique needs of people who search for self harm if we can help even one person feel more optimistic we know thats time well spent introducing coping exercises to compassionate search today we are expanding our compassionate search experience to better support people who are feeling sadness pain or other emotions related to the urge to self harm now if someone searches for a term related to self injury theyll find ten new coping exercises that can help them work through difficult emotions and feelings each exercise is guided with steps people can take to manage their feelings such as ways to redirect energy release tension or create a calm environment for example lets say you typed in self hate and chose the redirect your energy activity it would suggest starting a journal and rereading it a few days later to get some perspective on your thoughts or if writing isnt your thing you could try drawing a nature scene or making a playlist each activity is evidence based and comes out of our work with emotional health experts they arent meant to replace professional care but are carefully designed to help people improve their outlook people can also access the collection at any time by searching for pinterestwellbeing in our app for people who may be experiencing thoughts of suicide we continue to provide access to the national suicide prevention lifeline directly from our search results from the well being activities page and on boards with content that could signal someone is in emotional distress as i know myself emotional wellness is a personal journey thats why pinterest does not track who uses these exercises peoples interactions with these activities are stored anonymously using a third party service so that they wont be shown related recommendations or ads we were also thoughtful about the design of the experience making sure it felt separate from pinterest itself we used gentler colors to create a sense of harmony and calmness and specially designed the ui to keep peoples focus on the resources we also used a fullscreen approach that uses optimized typography to make the activities easy to read and follow along with developing these resources weve dramatically improved our ability to catch and remove content related to self harm our machine learning technologies are increasingly identifying and hiding this content before anyone sees it as a result reports of this content from pinners decreased by 88 percent over the last year a more positive internet i hear from a lot of pinners that they come to pinterest to do somethingcook a recipe plan a vacation but people also come to feel something quotes are the third most popular search term on all of pinterest as people look for words to help them feel more inspired inspirational quotes is 22 comforted life quotes is 34 and motivated motivational quotes is 38 we have a responsibility to recognize how and why people use our service and build experiences that help them feel more positive when they leave because sometimes you need more than an inspirational quote through our work with mental health experts weve learned a lot about trying to meet our pinners in whatever emotional state theyre in the reality is that more americans are reporting symptoms of depression seven in ten teens see depression and anxiety as major problems among their peers and when it comes to self harm a recent study showed that nearly 18 percent of u s teens reported harming themselves at least once during the previous year those rates are even higher among teenage girls affecting about one in four in some parts of america for some of the most painful emotional experiencesurges to self injure or thoughts of suicidemost tech platforms are good at connecting people to crisis hotlines but theres a gap between urges to self injure and thoughts of suicide experts confirm that these are different emotional states and they require different solutionsmost people who injure themselves are often not suicidal in the moment and instead are looking for a way to cope with their emotions the exercises we created bridge that gapoffering new ways for someone to reduce their stress levels in the moment and giving them tools they can use on a regular basis to cope with their emotions and if they ever need access to crisis prevention support its readily available from our app these new activities are available to pinners in the u s today in our apps for ios and android version 7 37 and above we are working to bring the experience to more pinners in more places soon evan sharp co

resources to support their health today were sharing an update on some of this work including a new preventive health tool in the us were working with us health organizations to offer a preventive health tool that connects people to health resources and checkup reminders people can use the tool to find affordable places to receive care set reminders to schedule tests mark when tests are completed and more by freddy abnousi md head of healthcare research many of todays leading health threats arent ones that science or medicine can solve alone changing trends in communication and unequal access to care mean we need new solutions and partnerships to overcome these global challenges take the issue of blood shortages every few seconds someone in the world needs blood but people often arent aware of shortages and dont know where to donate to address this we launched a feature in the us india brazil bangladesh and pakistan that makes it easy to sign up as a donor on facebook and get notified when nearby blood banks are in need so far more than 50 million people have signed up to donate another area were exploring is preventive health tens of millions of people in the us are missing out on recommended preventive care according to the centers for disease control and prevention preventive measures have the potential to detect disease early when its most treatable and in some cases prevent it from developing yet factors such as awareness access and cost create barriers to testing for many people to help were working with us health organizations to offer a new preventive health tool that connects people to health resources and checkup reminders our initial focus is on the top two leading causes of death in the us heart disease and cancer according to cdc as well as the flu a seasonal illness that affects millions each year the resources available in the tool are provided by the american cancer society the american college of cardiology the american heart association and the centers for disease control and prevention organizations recognized for their education and expertise in these areas heart disease is the number one killer of men and women around the world and in many cases it is 100 preventable by incorporating prevention reminders into platforms people are accessing every day were giving people the tools they need to be proactive about their heart health richard kovacs md president of the american college of cardiology how preventive health works in the us people can search for preventive health in the facebook mobile app and find out which checkups such as cholesterol tests or mammograms are recommended by these health organizations based on the age and sex they provide reminders for flu shots will also appear at the appropriate time of year the tool allows people to mark when tests are completed set reminders to schedule future tests and tell loved ones about the tool to increase awareness of preventive care people can also learn more about each checkup and find affordable places to receive care weve contributed our content and resources to the facebook preventive health tool to empower americans to take the first step to know about and take action to lower blood pressure blood sugar and cholesterol each of which has been shown to increase the chance of a longer healthier life and reduce the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke eduardo sanchez md chief medical officer for prevention at the american heart association one of the main reasons people dont get screened for cancer is that they dont realize their own risk we hope this program will help by building awareness about important recommendations from expert organizations richard wender md chief cancer control officer at the american cancer society most of the preventive measures recommended by the health organizations were working with such as blood pressure tests are free of charge with insurance coverage but we know many people do not have insurance to help people get affordable care preventive health offers a way to find federally qualified health centers near them these centers are located in underserved areas and provide care to everyone regardless of their ability to pay people can also use preventive health to find convenient locations that offer flu shots such as grocery stores pharmacies and urgent care clinics flu vaccines can have wide ranging benefits beyond just preventing the disease such as reducing the risk of hospitalization preventing serious medical events for some people with chronic diseases and protecting women during and after pregnancy new tools like this will empower users with instant access to information and resources they need to become a flu fighter in their own communities nancy messonnier md director national center for immunization and respiratory diseases cdc over time well work with additional organizations to include more resources and expand to other countries privacy matters health is particularly personal so we took privacy and safety into account from the beginning for example preventive health allows you to set reminders for your future checkups and mark them as done but it doesnt provide us or the health organizations were working with access to your actual test results personal information about your activity in preventive health is not shared with third parties such as health organizations or insurance companies so it cant be used for purposes like insurance eligibility we dont show ads based on the information you provide in preventive health that includes things like setting a reminder for a test marking it as done or searching for a healthcare location as always other actions that you take on facebook could inform the ads you see for example liking the facebook page of a health organization or visiting an external website linked to from preventive health to learn more about preventive health and privacy see this post our efforts across health preventive health and blood donations are just two of the ways we can help people advocate for their own health and help others according to our blood bank partners in india and brazil 20 of voluntary walk in blood donors are coming from facebook disease prevention maps from facebook help nonprofits and universities working in public health get ahead of disease outbreaks plan vaccination campaigns and reach vulnerable communities more effectively people turn to health support groups on facebook after being diagnosed with or while managing a health condition to connect with others who have had similar health experiences and find information and support we know theres more we can do to help people and well continue to partner with organizations to provide access to resources and

people information they can rely on when its not we lose an essential tool for making good decisions people want and benefit from personalized experiences on facebook but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience we want to support both today were starting to test facebook news a dedicated place for news on facebook to a subset of people in the us news gives people more control over the stories they see and the ability to explore a wider range of their news interests directly within the facebook app it also highlights the most relevant national stories of the day news articles will continue to appear in news feed as they do today as we looked to build a place where people can find more news on facebook we changed our approach to gather insight from journalists and publishers before we started developing a product as mark zuckerberg said in a conversation with mathias dopfner ceo of europes largest publisher axel springer we wanted to build this product in a consultative way sharing our ideas and getting input from the industry we talked to news organizations about what theyd like to see included in a news tab how their stories should be presented and what analytics to provide as we talked to people and publishers we identified key features to help make facebook news valuable todays stories chosen by a team of journalists to catch you up on the news throughout the day personalization based on the news you read share and follow so you can find new interests and topics and facebook news is fresh and interesting every time you open it topic sections to dive deeper into business entertainment health science tech and sports your subscriptions a section for people who have linked their paid news subscriptions to their facebook account controls to hide articles topics and publishers you dont want to see regarding personalization publishers worry that machine learning has limits and theyre right we have progress to make before we can rely on technology alone to provide a quality news destination we also aim to serve both people and news publishers and not just the big national players we want new forms of journalism in the digital age including individual independent journalism to flourish so we will continue to expand the algorithmic selection of stories driving the majority of facebook news when we started talking to news organizations about building facebook news earlier this year they emphasized that original reporting is more expensive to produce and better recognized by seasoned journalists than by algorithms so to help reward this kind of work we formed a curation team to manage the todays stories section of facebook news the team will have editorial independence and will select stories based on publicly available guidelines which you can learn about at facebook com news what you can expect to see in facebook news facebook news will feature a wide range of content across four categories of publishers general topical diverse and local news at the beginning of the year we surveyed over 100 000 people on facebook in the us about what topics they were most interested in and found that we were under serving many topics people wanted most in their news feeds especially around categories like entertainment health business and sports we took this into consideration as we identified publishers across those four categories how do we identify these publishers they need to be in our news page index which we developed in collaboration with the industry to identify news content they also need to abide by facebooks publisher guidelines these include a range of integrity signals in determining product eligibility including misinformation as identified based on third party fact checkers community standards violations e g hate speech clickbait engagement bait and others well continually check pages integrity status to ensure eligibility criteria is consistently being met lastly they must serve a sufficiently large audience with different thresholds for the four categories of publishers our criteria will evolve over time to make sure people are seeing sources that are valuable to them and that were including reporting across these topics during the initial test well showcase local original reporting by surfacing local publications from the largest major metro areas across the country beginning with new york los angeles chicago dallas fort worth philadelphia houston washington dc miami atlanta and boston in the coming months well include local news from today in our local news and community information tab which recently expanded to over 6 000 us towns and cities facebook news was built to bring people closer to the stories that affect their lives well continue to learn listen and improve news as it rolls out more broadly we hope this work aids in our effort to sustain great journalism and strengthen

of product management many apps and websites are free because theyre supported by online advertising and to reach people who are more likely to care about what they are selling businesses often share data about peoples interactions on their websites with ad platforms and other services this is how much of the internet works but given that the average person with a smartphone has more than 80 apps and uses about 40 of them every month it can be really difficult for people to keep track of who has information about them and what its used for to help shed more light on these practices that are common yet not always well understood today were introducing a new way to view and control your off facebook activity off facebook activity lets you see a summary of the apps and websites that send us information about your activity and clear this information from your account if you want to this is another way to give people more transparency and control on facebook along with recent updates to our ad library updates to why am i seeing this ad and the launch of a new feature called why am i seeing this post what is off facebook activity imagine a clothing website wants to show ads to people who are interested in a new style of shoes they can send information to facebook saying someone on a particular device looked at those shoes if that device information matches someones facebook account we can show ads about those shoes to that person to explain this further we put together some resources here with off facebook activity you can see and control the data that other apps and

facebook activity well remove your identifying information from the data that apps and websites choose to send us we wont know which websites you visited or what you did there and we wont use any of the data you disconnect to target ads to you on facebook instagram or messenger we expect this could have some impact on our business but we believe giving people control over their data is more important when you visit off facebook activity youll see the websites and apps that you use regularly but you might also see some services that you dont recognize for example a website you didnt visit could show up because a friend looked it up on your phone or because you share a home computer with your partner and kids to help answer common questions people might have we have additional

year social networks can serve as the digital equivalent of a town square or a living room we know people have needs for both public spaces where you can share with a wide audience and private ones where you can share more intimately for facebook groups people have historically been able to choose between being public closed or secret settings for their group to better match peoples expectations and help provide more clarity were rolling out a new simplified privacy model for groups public and private were making this change because weve heard from people that they want more clarity about the privacy settings for their groups having two privacy settings public and private will help make it clearer about who can find the group and see the members and posts that are part of it weve also heard that most people prefer to use the terms public and private to describe the privacy settings of groups they belong to over the last year we worked closely with global privacy experts and advocates who are working to raise awareness of how to better manage your information online these experts provided us with key insights to help ensure that these new privacy settings are clearer and simpler to use our community standards and proactive detection technology will continue to apply across private and public groups just as they did for the previous privacy settings of public closed and secret groups this allows us to find and remove bad actors and bad content helping keep facebook safe for everyone new groups privacy settings with two clear options this new privacy model is much more intuitive public groups allow anyone to see whos in the group and everything thats shared there with private groups only members can see who else is in the group and what theyve posted we also heard that people wanted more control over how their groups can be discovered so now admins will be able to clearly choose whether or not the group can be found in search and other places by separating the privacy settings for posts and group membership from the overall discoverability of the group it is easier for admins to understand and manage their group privacy settings and also easier for members to know important information like who can find the group by default a group that was formerly secret will now be private and hidden a group that was formerly closed will now be private and visible groups that are public will remain public and visible admins can find the new controls in their group settings just as it is today there are restrictions to if and when an admin can change the privacy setting of a group group members are always notified when an admin updates the groups privacy setting safety were committed to ensuring that people have a safe experience on facebook over the last few years weve invested heavily in people and technology hiring more than 30 000 people across our safety and security teams within this a specialized team has been working on the safe communities initiative with the goal of protecting people using facebook groups from harm much of the work they do is around proactively identifying and removing posts and groups that break our rules across both private and public groups increasingly we can use ai and machine learning to proactively detect bad content before anyone reports it and sometimes before people even see it as content is flagged by our systems or reported by people trained reviewers consider context and determine whether the content violates our community standards we then use these examples to train our technology to get better at finding and removing similar content weve written more about how we enforce our policies in private groups here resources when people are part of a group on facebook its important that they know who can see their information and the content they choose to share with their community to help with this transition weve developed a number of resources for admins and members about these changes including educational videos and articles on our community site you can also find more details about the new group privacy settings in our help

authoritative vaccine results to Pinterest search","text":"more than 300 million people come to pinterest every month to get inspired and find ideas from easy weeknight meals to crafts to do with kids we believe a healthy life is an inspired life and today we have an update on our efforts to combat health misinformation were introducing a new experience for vaccine related searches on pinterest now when you search for measles vaccine safety and other related health terms you can explore reliable results about immunizations from leading public health organizations including the world health organization who the centers for disease control cdc the american academy of pediatrics aap and the who established vaccine safety net vsn a global network of websites providing reliable vaccine safety information in various languages last year we made the decision to stop showing results for searches related to vaccines as a way to prevent people from encountering harmful health misinformation this new search experience only shows content from leading public health institutionsyou wont see any recommendations or comments on pins in these results we also wont show ads were taking this approach because we believe that showing vaccine misinformation alongside resources from public health experts isn t responsible as we continue to tackle health misinformation we remove it and the accounts that spread it from our service but we also want to bring expert content onto pinterest we know we arent medical experts which is why were working with professionals to inspire pinners with reliable information about health with these authoritative pins now in our system they can also be discovered in home feed related pins and from the profiles of the who vsn cdc and aap health misinformation is contagious hesitancy around vaccines is one of this years top global health threats according to the who the who opens in a new window recently announced that the uk albania czechia and greece have lost their measles free status and the cdc confirmed that the u s is experiencing the greatest number of measles cases reported since 1992 and since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000 since 2017 its been against our community guidelines to promote anti vaccination advice and other health misinformation and weve never allowed it to be advertised weve long used guidance from these health institutions to inform our policy and how we enforce it but we wanted to do more heres why health misinformation has the potential to impact public health regardless of what service its found on allowing this content to spread through pinterests search results is not in line with enforcing our community guidelines thats why were limiting search results to internationally recognized health organizations what we and others have observed is an enthusiasm gap between those creating and disseminating harmful health misinformation and those creating resources rooted in settled science generally theres more accessible and visually compelling health misinformation than science based journal articles on the virtues of vaccinations in addition weve found that some purveyors of health misinformation have a financial incentive for instance some sell products and potions and others use spammer tactics and clickbait to drive traffic to their own sites where they monetize on top of that experts have shown theres a data void when it comes to reliable information about vaccinestheres a greater distribution of vaccine misinformation than information in short anti vaccine content is contagious as another way to address that gap were developing creative resources that health organizations can easily use to create visually compelling pins for content thats primarily text based for example below is a pin the aap created with the help of our creative team the work continues were starting with vaccinations because the who determined that vaccine hesitancy is a significant threat to everyone well need to keep evolving our list of terms for which we block medical misinformation and provide expert advice as people try to get around our safeguards well also continue to remove this content and accounts that spread it from our service this new search experience is now available globally in english on the web and in our mobile apps for iphone and android we look forward to continuing our work with health experts to expand authoritative results on other searches and in more languages ultimately we want to bring authoritative results to more pinners in more places because theres nothing inspiring about harmful health misinformation ifeoma ozoma public policy and social impact

claims especially for short segments has led to some confusion as the claims sometimes lack key information that can help to resolve the issue while its important that creators understand and respect copyright its also important that they have knowledge of who is claiming content in their videos where it appears and what they can do about it starting today we will require copyright owners to provide timestamps to indicate exactly where their content appears in videos they manually claim and were improving our video editing tools in creator studio to make it easier for creators to remove the content associated with these claims manual claiming is a tool within content id that allows select copyright owners to manually make claims on videos that were not automatically made by our content id matching system previously we did not require copyright owners using the manual claiming tool to provide timestamps so it was sometimes unclear to creators which parts of their videos were being claimed and in addition unlike edits that removed content identified by automated claims the claims wouldnt be automatically released were making the experience better for you in two important ways 1 copyright owners must now provide timestamps for exactly what part of your video is being manually claimed just as you would if you receive an automatic claim from our content id matching system youll now see timestamps in creator studio when you get a manual claim check out the video copyright info page in youtube studio that offers a visualization of where the manually claimed content appears in your video and also it provides more info about the content being claimed well be evaluating the accuracy of these timestamps copyright owners who repeatedly fail to provide accurate data will have their access to manual claiming revoked 2 you can use our editing tools to remove the content claimed manually in your video which will now automatically release the claims weve updated our editing tools to make it easier to remove manually claimed content from your video if you choose to remove the content the claim will now be released automatically below are some of the options you have without having to edit and upload a new video mute all sound when the claimed song plays if you get a claim for a piece of music in your video you can now mute the time stamped segment replace the song if you dont want to mute the audio entirely you can instead swap out the music with one of our free to use songs from the youtube audio library we also added new visual indicators below the video player which show exactly what segment of the video is claimed this can help you position the audio track in such a way that will remove the claims from your video trim out the content you also have the option to cut out the time stamped segment from your video using the trim feature in the youtube editor were still working on several improvements here like having an explicit trim option in the video copyright info page that will allow you to trim out the claimed content with just one click you can learn more about these changes in our help center remember if you receive a claim that you believe is incorrect you have the right to dispute it you know the most about the content in your videos and whether it was used appropriately so we built the dispute process to empower you to escalate any problems to the copyright owner and even as far as the courts if you choose if both you and the person claiming your video are attempting to monetize it we will continue to show ads on the video during the dispute process and make sure the appropriate party gets the revenue once the dispute is resolved our work wont stop here were always looking to find ways to

other users for posts and comments that elevate the conversation and culture within a given community unlike reddit silver gold and platinum however community awards are customized and designed by communities themselves allowing a wider range of expression and interaction in line with the culture jokes and content of those communities community awards will become available to eligible communities starting on july 24 designing community awards community awards are created and customized by moderator teams who are able to select the icons names and coin prices that best reflect their communitys culture in some cases mods may ask their communities to weigh in on designs and icons before introducing new community awards to the group moderators can customize and offer up six new awards for users to give at price points ranging from 500 to 40 000 coins rewarding content with community awards within participating communities users have the option to give community awards through the standard awarding process when a user clicks on the give award button community awards for that community will appear alongside the existing reddit silver gold and platinum award options because community awards are customized by the mods of individual communities they are only available for awarding within the community for which they were created for instance the mind blown award below can only be awarded within the r iama community community response community awards is a product many months in the making after building an early version of awards we reached out to moderators from r nba r murderedbywords r science and others to collect feedback iterate and build an awards experience that would feel customized and relevant for all reddit communities over the past several months weve worked closely with moderators and users to continue testing the feature and have been surprised once again by the creativity of our communities on r dundermifflin the mods have turned series long inside jokes like jims classic stapler in the jell o prank into individual awards on r nba the mods have found ways to incorporate their communitys culture of data analysis and statistics with the apt analysis award which was one of the first examples on the platform were excited to offer community awards more widely and see what else our communities come up with whats next in the coming weeks community awards will become available to all eligible communities as we help onboard as many new communities as possible for more details including how to create community awards check

do this is through ranking which promotes meaningful conversations by showing people the posts and comments most relevant to them today were making an update to improve comment ranking on public posts and we want to explain how this works and how pages and people can control their own comment ranking settings how we rank public comments in addition to ranking posts in peoples news feed we rank comments on public posts from pages and people with a lot of followers since these posts tend to have many comments in order to show people relevant and quality comments we incorporate a number of signals including integrity signals we want people to see safe and authentic comments if a comment violates our community standards we remove it we also take into account other signals like engagement bait to address the integrity of information and improve the quality of comments people see what people tell us they want to see in comments weve been using more surveys to help us understand the types of comments people want to see so we can rank those higher how people interact with comments this includes signals including whether people like react to or reply to a comment what the poster controls people can moderate the comments on their post by hiding deleting or engaging with comments ranking is on by default for pages and people with a a lot of followers but pages and people with a lot of followers can choose to turn off comment ranking people who dont have as many followers will not have comment ranking turned on automatically since there are less comments overall but any person can decide to enable comment ranking by going to their settings see more details here always improving comment ranking to improve relevance and quality well start showing comments on public posts more prominently when the comments have interactions from the page or person who originally posted or the comments or reactions are from friends of the person who posted we will continue to take other signals into account so we do not prominently show low quality comments even if they are from the person who made the original post or their

to see the vertical videos that our community has shared on igtv weve learned and grown a lot in this first year in meeting with creators and viewers weve heard about what they like and what needs to be improved in fact that feedback has driven many of igtvs biggest changes so far this includes the most important change we made this year enabling creators to publish previews of igtv videos to their instagram feed which added another way for viewers to discover igtv videos since that launched february weve seen viewers spending more time with igtv and a surge of new original content from creators of all sizes today marks yet another change for igtv and it once again comes from listening to our creators and viewers weve heard from creators who want to upload landscape videos for igtv similarly weve heard from viewers who come across landscape videos in igtv but want to watch them in a more natural way thats why were announcing support for landscape videos in addition to vertical ultimately our vision is to make igtv a destination for great content no matter how its shot so creators can express themselves how they want we realize this is an evolution from where igtv started we believe its the right change for viewers and creators in many ways opening igtv to more than just vertical videos is similar to when we opened instagram to more than just square photos in 2015 it enabled creativity to flourish and engagement to rise and we believe the same will happen again with igtv for viewers this means igtv will be a place to watch even more content from the creators they love and do it straight from their phone for creators this means more freedom to express themselves how they want vertical videos work great for creators who want to be up close and personal with their audience but landscape also has its strengths especially when it comes to formats like dance and sports which are high motion and often feature a handful of people in frame we want to say thank you to all the creators who are building meaningful strong and diverse communities and helping create the future of tv on mobile this is just the beginning well continue to evolve to not only help you

topic or annoying the option is a new way to shut out noise 85 of the people who hide replies are not using block or mute people were curious to see how public figures like those in politics and journalism would use this update so far they aren t hiding replies very often in canada 27 of people who had their tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future also they thought it was a helpful way to manage what they saw similar to muted keywords we learned that you may want to take further action after you hide a reply so now well check to see if you want to also block the replier some people mentioned that they didnt want to hide replies due to fear of retaliation as the icon remains visible well continue to get feedback on this these are early findings and we look forward to continued learning as the feature is used by more people looking ahead were working on new controls and more clarity around the rules of conversation spaces soon well

starts a conversation can hide replies based on our research and surveys we conducted we saw a lot of positive trends during our initial test in canada including people mostly hide replies that they think are irrelevant abusive or unintelligible those who used the tool thought it was a helpful way to control what they saw similar to when keywords are muted we saw that people were more likely to reconsider their interactions when their tweet was hidden 27 of people who had their tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future people were concerned hiding someones reply could be misunderstood and potentially lead to confusion or frustration as a result now if you tap to hide a tweet well check in with you to see if you want to also block that account these are positive and heartening results the feature helped people have better conversations and was a useful tool against replies that deterred from the persons original intent we re interested to

we create better products whenever we bring together different talents and perspectives into a room weve seen this play out at pinterest one example is a feature we piloted last year to give people a more inclusive way to discover beauty ideas we had heard from pinners of color who were frustrated that they had to work so hard to find the most personally relevant ideas to them this was a problem we needed to address a cross functional group came together from across the company including members of our engineering inclusion and diversity and product teams we reached out to pinners and looked at ways to improve our machine learning technology and content the result was a new feature allowing people to customize their beauty search results by skin tone were continuing to make improvements to this product and will be launching it on mobile in the coming weeks although we know there is a lot more work to do this was one important step in serving all of our pinners another was making pinterest more accessible for people who are visually impaired diversity makes our product and our company better this is something we have believed since we got started in 2010 but we know that belief doesnt always translate into practice and action in fact once we started scaling quickly we began to look like every other technology company so in 2015 we did something new and set annual public hiring goals just as we had set goals for every other aspect of our business we chose to do the same thing for attracting and growing talent from diverse backgrounds we made these goals public to help hold ourselves accountable and to help us get input and ideas from others in the industry in 2018 we achieved two of our three hiring goals specifically our goal was to increase hiring rates for people from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds in non engineering roles to 12 we exceeded that goal and reached 14 our goal was to increase hiring rates for engineers from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds to 8 we reached 7 which is better than last year but still short our goal was to increase the hiring rates for full time women engineers to 25 we hit that goal and reached 25 in addition representation of women increased in the company overall and in tech women now make up 47 of the company up from 45 last year and 30 of the people working in tech are women up from 29 last year we know there is a ton more work to do here are some of the things weve learned along the way that we plan to apply in 2019 build relationships with underrepresented talent all the time this year we focused on diversifying where we sourced candidates and providing unconscious bias training to our interviewers and managers however we were inconsistent about building long term relationships with talent relationships cant be turned on and off building them requires continuous effort even when there arent open positions we created explicit goals for managers to spend time meeting new talent and not only people who are in the industry today but also with people who are likely to enter our industry in the future apprenticeship programs work we launched this program three years ago to attract talent from non traditional tech backgrounds like coding boot camp graduates and self taught coders weve converted 93 of participants into full time engineers those who didnt went on to get software engineering jobs at other companies invest in employee communities from 2016 2018 weve grown the number of employee resource groups from 1 to 8 they play an essential role in helping develop leaders addressing concerns of employees and users and fostering belonging we are proud that an internal survey reports that 85 of our employees tell us they feel like they belong at pinterest our highest

platform opened to videos from all pages and we debuted dozens of facebook originals amazing new content on watch really got people talking from jada pinkett smiths breakout talk show red table talk to the critically acclaimed dramas sorry for your loss starring elizabeth olsen and sacred lies from showrunner raelle tucker to live laliga football matches in the indian subcontinent we also kick started our slate of global shows with our first interactive game show confetti expanding to six new markets this year and mtvs the real world arriving next year in the us mexico and thailand and creators around the world like nas daily jay shetty and laura clery are thriving on the platform with their unique brands of humor insight and creativity three months since our global launch there are already more than 400 million people monthly and 75 million people daily who spend at least one minute on watch and on average these 75 million daily visitors spend more than 20 minutes in watch were seeing that people are regularly coming back to catch up on the videos they care about and watching for longer periods of time in this post were sharing more details on our video strategy and a range of new updates for watch building watch for conversations community connections we know that people have a range of video offerings available to them but watch is more than just library of videos its a place where people can follow video creators they care about start conversations about videos with friends and build communities of fans who share their interests watching video has always been a social experience but as people increasingly watch video online it has become more solitary with facebook watch we set out to demonstrate what it looks like to build deep bonds through watching online video instead of just having a passive viewing experience the ability to connect more deeply around content is what sets the video experience on facebook apart we learned with facebook live how powerful it is when people can connect with each other around videos in real time and weve been building new video formats and features that capture the togetherness of live since the summer we have been working to bring watch party to everyone on facebook weve seen it really take off there have been more than 12 million watch parties in groups alone and watch parties garner eight times more comments than regular videos in groups people can start their own watch parties with friends and were also seeing watch parties from all kinds of creators and publishers from italian creator benedetta rossi who hosts watch parties for her recipe videos to shaquille oneals recent watch party for favorite episodes of his facebook watch show big chicken shaq we launched premieres letting creators publishers and people watch new videos together with other fans and weve introduced polling and gamification tools giving video creators the power to create fun unique and interactive content for their fans in the coming months were focused on bringing more of these social experiences to watch making it easier to find and watch videos together with friends were also working to unify the video experience across facebook right now people can find videos on facebook in a number of different places watch news feed search pages and more and all of these can feel different we want to make the experience of watching video feel immersive no matter where you discovered it as part of this effort well be testing a few things in the coming months like creating a darker background whenever you immerse yourself into a video on mobile unifying these different viewing experiences under one and today were sharing that people can now find watch on more surfaces in august we rolled out watch globally on mobile and from today watch is now available around the world on desktop and on facebook lite creating more opportunities for our partners since the beginning weve been focused on making watch a place where all creators and publishers can find an audience and build a community of passionate fans and importantly earn money for their work we know that building a sustainable ecosystem for video creators is the best way to bring great content to the platform and this was our goal with opening watch to all pages and rolling out ad breaks our initial launch of ad breaks was to five countries in august and we have been focused on rolling out the product over the past few months today we are announcing that ad breaks are now available to eligible pages in 40 countries around the world in 2019 we will continue to expand the ways publishers and creators can make money on facebook well bring ad breaks to video creators in more countries around the world and will test new ad breaks placements like in livestreams from gaming creators we want to bring brand collabs manager to more countries to help match brands and creators for sponsorship deals and will be expanding our fan subscriptions test were also exploring new opportunities for advertisers in september we introduced in stream reserve for premium online video and tv buyers to deliver their ads alongside the highest quality watch content and next year we will continue to provide advertisers with more options to tailor their video ad campaigns and connect with their target audience in all this weve learned that for monetization products to work they must balance the unique needs of video creators people and advertisers providing value for all parties next year we will continue focusing on enhancing these tools to enable publishers and creators to generate meaningful revenue from their engaged loyal audiences on facebook investing in original content that sparks conversations since launch weve funded a range of facebook originals on watch and many have found their fit with strong engaged audiences with originals weve intentionally focused on content with the potential to have an extended life on facebook beyond the initial airing of the shows that really sparks conversations and two way interactions for example the hosts of red table talk poll their audience for discussion topics for their weekly show mike rowes returning the favor selects participants for future episodes based on community recommendations and the ball in the family facebook group is full of conversation between episodes and seasons we know that in the age of peak tv simply being entertaining or having high production values isnt good enough a show needs to strike a chord in the broader cultural zeitgeist or serve a group of passionate people that want something they cant get elsewhere that something could come in the form of a personal connection with the talent or content that covers a niche subject matter with shows on facebook those personal connections are possible and those fan bases are often already well formed and reachable on the platform this is the lens we use when funding original series and the advice we give partners looking to create engaging content as we move into 2019 we will continue funding originals and were delighted to announce the renewal of four shows for a second season huda boss five points sacred lies and sorry for your loss these shows all cultivated deeply engaged fan bases who came for the episodes but stayed for the conversations and are a great example of what can happen when content and community come together seamlessly you can read more in our media blog as mentioned above our content strategy goes beyond our originals including licensing partnerships and more so that we can test and learn about new video experiences above all our strategy is about identifying the type of content that people want to talk about and helping people have meaningful connections around that content on facebook looking ahead since launch our aim with facebook watch has been to create a destination that people can visit to find the videos that matter to them the video creators they want to see and other fans that they can connect with everything we do is in service of this and well continue this mission in 2019"},{"id":"cbde9299-803b-4013-b7c3-762c75939882","platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/12/giving-people-new-ways-to-commemorate-moments-on-facebook/","date":"2018-12-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product

your news feed information youve listed on your profile places where youve been tagged and previous searches youve done your facebook search results are also based on general facebook community activity including the popularity of whatever youre searching for and how recently it was posted whatever you search for on the rest of the internet will not influence what you see when you search on facebook all content that you see on facebook is governed by the facebook community standards these community standards are developed by facebook and the community in partnership with a global team of

in the us and we have launched our first international test in australia in addition we have started testing today in in communities located in news deserts places that have low supply of local news and community information by supplementing with relevant content from surrounding areas earlier this year we started testing today in after we did research in which over 50 of people told us they wanted to see more local news and community information on facebook more than any other type of content we asked about the research showed that people wanted both what might be traditionally understood as local news breaking news or information about past events like city council meetings crime reports and weather updates as well as community information that could help them make plans like bus schedules road closures and restaurant openings today in aggregates local news and community information in a separate section within the facebook app people who live in a city where today in is currently available can visit this section directly and they can choose to turn on local updates to start seeing a collection of local news more regularly in their news feed weve seen that people value today in for helping them stay informed about whats happening nearby finding information that directly impacts their day and discovering ways to support their local community through events or volunteer opportunities according to one user tina from peoria illinois i use today in peoria every day thats the first thing i do in the morning i work a lot of hoursmy phone is always on me and its

feed story local alerts from government and first responder pages in addition to expanding the availability of today in were running a test with over 100 local government and first responder pages to help them communicate time sensitive and need to know information to people on facebook people tell us it is important to receive timely local updates in situations that directly affect them or that require them to take action such as major road closures blackouts or natural disasters the local alert label appears in news feed and today in and we are also testing notifications which participating pages can target to people who live in the affected areas during hurricane florence 17 first responder pages posted 73 local alerts providing critical updates to people living in the path of the storm the city of charlotte government is one of our first partners to test local alerts during hurricane florence we saw the power of the local alerts functionality seconds after applying the tag increased engagement especially shares with our critical messages played an invaluable role in helping keep our community safe being able to reach all of our followers and residents in the immediate area during a crisis or major event is a game changer local government pages participating in the test can mark their posts as local alerts at their discretion pages can post up to 35 local alerts over a rolling 30 day period and can mark a post as a local alert for up to six hours this will not affect the ranking of posts in news feed local alerts on facebook are not meant to replace emergency alert systems

400 us cities originally published on october 10 2018 when hurricane florence hit the southeastern coast of the us in september anthea watson strong was keeping a close eye on the news in columbia sc despite the fact that she lives 700 miles away in new york city columbia is one of over a hundred us cities where facebook has been testing today in a section in the mobile app that connects people to local news and information watson strong a product manager has been leading this work for the past year and a half since the tests began rolling out in january people in mid sized cities from allentown to yakima have had a dedicated place to see not only articles from local publishers but also content from less formal sources of information people in those cities can also opt into receiving a digest of local updates in their news feed during florence watson strong watched as police departments posted about downed power lines school districts gave parents up to the minute school closure updates and community groups shared tips about which stores still had supplies these are the things that really paint a nuanced portrait of a community watson strong says its especially apparent during a crisis like florence but its true during less newsworthy times as well the team was inspired to build the feature after a series of surveys helped outline what kinds of local information people were looking for the research showed that people wanted both what might be traditionally understood as local news breaking news or information about past events like city council meetings crime reports and weather updates as well as community information that could help them make plans like bus schedules road closures and restaurant openings there was really no place on the internet collecting information from local publishers as well as less formal sources of information parks libraries first responders says watson strong content for the section is brought in from all over facebook the in the news section for example identifies local publishers using the same back end technology that helps prioritize local news in news feed to find the relevant pages for community organizations like government agencies art museums and animal shelters an algorithm looks for local affinity that is a page whose fans are geographically located near the organization all content shown in the today in section gets passed through facebooks integrity filters which helps weed out content that is spammy contains hate speech or displays other misleading or inauthentic content we also wanted to help users more easily see and engage with the local content in research conducted over the past few years the majority of people who responded to our surveys said they wanted to see more local news on facebook but what was actually preventing them from doing so first the team investigated whether there was enough local news being produced in the first place we researched news deserts or areas with no local news publishers and determined that although this would certainly affect some cities even residents of places with robust news media werent seeing as much local information as they wanted and most local publishers share their articles on facebook or post to facebook directly so the issue didnt seem to be that there wasnt enough local content on facebook rather it was more that we needed to make it easier for people to see it on facebook second the team considered whether there was a better way to connect people to that existing content we know from our research that people want a more predictable way to find local content on facebook recent ranking changes were making local news more prominent in news feed but people wanted a place where they could get all the most important information for their community and they didnt want to rely on the serendipity of news feed to deliver it to them by building both a dedicated space in the app as well as presenting the option to get a collection of local updates in news feed itself the team helped solve the twin problems of discoverability and predictability that is how to help people find local news as well as get it on a regular basis finally the team had to figure out which cities to start testing in in these early stages the team has picked cities where there was a continuous stream of fresh content as well as enough people actively using facebook to ensure that the feature would be valuable we also looked for cities that were small and densely populated enough for the updates to be relevant to all people within that city in a city like new york people really want information on more of a neighborhood level not a city level watson strong says if you live in brooklyn school closings in queens probably dont matter too much to you engagement with the today in section as well as the digest in news feed has been high thus far and in recent weeks the today in feature has expanded from a few dozen to over a hundred cities this is a big leap for us in terms of stress testing the product watson strong notes as the team continues to test and refine the product there are a number of areas were excited to continue exploring for example weve been partnering with over 100 first responder pages in 83 cities and counties like police departments fire departments and city and county governments to test local alerts a special time bound indicator that can be applied to a pages facebook posts to communicate urgent information as more government pages are brought into the local alert program the today in section will be a natural place to show these updates in addition to news feed and in facebooks notifications watson strong is especially excited about the today in features potential to help build constructive dialogue across facebook research has shown that local news generally leads to higher levels of cross cutting likes that is when people across the ideological spectrum engage on the same piece of content long term i want it to be a place where people can participate in high quality public discussions about the issues affecting their neighborhoods says watson strong i want to build the infrastructure that helps people create safe supportive and inclusive communities want to see if the today in feature is available in your city head to the facebook app and tap the menu if its in your city youll see today in listed as an option from there you can also opt into receiving regular updates in news feed see also how users help

Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI","Product News"],"title":"Expanding Fact-Checking to Photos and Videos","text":"by antonia woodford product manager we know that people want to see accurate information on facebook so for the last two years weve made fighting misinformation a priority one of the many steps we take to reduce the spread of false news is working with independent third party fact checkers to review and rate the accuracy of content to date most of our fact checking partners have focused on reviewing articles however we have also been actively working to build new technology and partnerships so that we can tackle other forms of misinformation today were expanding fact checking for photos and videos to all of our 27 partners in 17 countries around the world and are regularly on boarding new fact checking partners this will help us identify and take action against more types of misinformation faster how does this work similar to our work for articles we have built a machine learning model that uses various engagement signals including feedback from people on facebook to identify potentially false content we then send those photos and videos to fact checkers for their review or fact checkers can surface content on their own many of our third party fact checking partners have expertise evaluating photos and videos and are trained in visual verification techniques such as reverse image searching and analyzing image metadata like when and where the photo or video was taken fact checkers are able to assess the truth or falsity of a photo or video by combining these skills with other journalistic practices like using research from experts academics or government agencies as we get more ratings from fact checkers on photos and videos we will be able to improve the accuracy of our machine learning model we are also leveraging other technologies to better recognize false or misleading content for example we use optical character recognition ocr to extract text from photos and compare that text to headlines from fact checkers articles we are also working on new ways to detect if a photo or video has been manipulated these technologies will help us identify more potentially deceptive photos and videos to send to fact checkers for manual review learn more about how we approach this work in an interview with tessa lyons product manager on news feed how do we categorize false photos and videos based on several months of research and testing with a handful of partners since march we know that misinformation in photos and videos usually falls into three categories 1 manipulated or fabricated 2 out of context and 3 text or audio claim these are the kinds of false photos and videos that we see on facebook and hope to further reduce with the expansion of photo and video fact checking see more details on these examples from the fact checkers debunking articles animal politico afp france 24 and boom live whats different about photos and videos people share millions of photos and videos on facebook every day we know that this kind of sharing is particularly compelling because its visual that said it also creates an easy opportunity for manipulation by bad actors based on research with people around the world we know that false news spreads in many different forms varying from country to country for example in the us people say they see more misinformation in articles whereas in indonesia people say they see more misleading photos however these categories are not distinct the same hoax can travel across different content types so its important to build defenses against misinformation across articles as well as photos and videos whats next we know that fighting false news is a long term commitment as the tactics used by bad actors are always changing as we take action in the short term were also continuing to invest in more technology and partnerships so that we can stay ahead of new types of misinformation in the future learn more about our fight against misinformation in facing

easier for people who want help achieving their goals to connect with others in their community who have the experience or expertise to help last year we piloted mentorship and by bringing it to groups people in existing communities can now connect and get one on one support through a guided program for example two mothers in mama dragons a group meant to empower and support mothers with lgbtqia children are helping each other navigate the journey of raising a transgender child also a woman was paired with a mentor from soap making and business coaching who has helped her take her love for making soap from a hobby to a business mentorship is available to people within select groups focused on parenting professional and personal development heres how it works group admins create a mentorship program admins can choose from a variety of template programs such as career advancement skill development or encouragement and support and select the one that best fits their communitys needs people sign up and are matched with their mentor mentee group members can sign up to be a mentor or a mentee then the group admin will pair people together pairs are introduced pairs can get to know each other and work through program steps in their one on one mentorship program on facebook they can share and comment on posts there or communicate through messenger mentors and mentees get step by step guidance the pairs progress through a guided program that encourages them to check in with each other weekly mentorship is built with privacy and safety in mind all communications between a mentor and mentee is visible only to the pair people can report issues to facebook and they have access to the same reporting and blocking features available elsewhere on facebook mentorship is only available to people 18 years and older our goal is to build tools that help people get the support they need we hope that mentorship makes it easier for people to build relationships that help them

breaking news label today which can be seen by facebook users in canada the us the uk australia mexico spain france and germany originally published on august 7 2018 on june 23 2018 floodwaters suddenly trapped a team of teenage soccer players whod been exploring a cave complex in thailand over 17 days the world watched anxiously as rescue teams assembled divers located the boys and a two day operation finally brought them and their coach to safety the rescue has been one of the biggest news stories of the year full of drama and tension its also a prime example of the kind of developing news story that news feed isnt always well equipped to capture posts in news feed are generally ranked according to their relevancy to each individual not strictly by chronology or by how any given post relates to the other posts that appear beside it so when a news story stretches across multiple days and multiple updates people on facebook can end up getting that story in scattered potentially out of order bits and pieces people might see reports on the trapped teens but then wouldnt have a way of knowing if those were the latest or most crucial updates in interviews and surveys facebook users in the us reported that the variety and volume of content in news feed was making it hard for even dedicated news consumers to follow developing news on the platform meanwhile through the facebook journalism project which brings news organizations and facebook product teams together to collaborate on product development among other things publishers were telling facebook that they wanted help quickly communicating urgent news stories and using breaking coverage to build more audience loyalty brian kadar a facebook engineer who works on news products sums up the challenge this way how do we capture that a story is alive for about a year now kadar and his colleagues along with publishers as a part of the facebook journalism project have been experimenting with ways to do just that this is a chart weve used to show how were thinking about the life cycle of a news story he says of the image above its not a formal roadmap but it shows how different points along the way present different opportunities for us to help publishers get their journalism in front of their readers as a story unfolds the teams first test launched in november 2017 is a label that lets publishers mark instant articles links and facebook live videos as breaking to preserve its value as an identifier of important stories each label can last for six hours maximum and publishers are limited to using it once a day with a few extra each month for big news days in june 2018 the team launched its second test giving news publishers the ability to string together multiple updates on a given news story each update appears as a new post in news feed but users who choose to follow the overall story by clicking a button on any of the individual updates receive a notification whenever new content is shared that notification links to a page where people can view all of the related updates in chronological order test partners used the feature to tell stories across major events like the mueller investigation the capitals winning the stanley cup and the thai cave rescue to date more people followed the rescue via story updates from eight different publishers than all other topics combined it was a tailor made case for the tool says kadar it played out over an extended period of time and people were really invested in following it through to the end over 100 publishers across the globe use the breaking news label today which can be seen by facebook users in canada and the us and is also being tested in a handful of international markets meanwhile 14 publishers in the us australia canada great britain and india are participating in the developing news test and a small subset of facebook users in those countries can see developing news updates in their news feed this is standard practice for rolling out new facebook features explains product manager mona sarantakos we test with a small group learn adjust then roll it out to a bigger group learn adjust in the case of these news product features the team is also collaborating closely with publishers throughout the development process if we see that people and publishers are getting real value out of these features says sarantakos well roll the features out even more widely today along with their publishing partners facebooks team is focusing on refining the designs of the developing news tools to make it clearer that each update is part of a larger story narrative and encourage them to see facebook as a place to get a cohesive look at a big news story from publishers they trust we want facebook to be a place where publishers can help people understand the news says kadar not just deliver them bits and pieces of it"},{"id":"13088eb6-e241-4176-8d0b-2b99dcb410c7","platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/08/helping-people-connect-with-local-businesses/","date":"2018-08-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product

the globe watch party is a new way for people to watch videos on facebook together in real time once a watch party is started participants can watch videos live or recorded and interact with one another around them in the same moment weve been focused on building new ways to bring people together around video create connections and ignite conversations watch party is the next step in bringing this vision to life we are now starting to test the ability for people to start watch parties with friends outside of groups too and well explore watch parties for pages in the future we believe that if people can start a watch party directly from their profile or from a video theyre watching the experience of watching video on facebook can become even more fun and social watch party in groups weve been encouraged by feedback from groups using watch party as weve been testing and rolling out weve heard from group leaders that theyre excited to use watch party for things like hosting q as around particular hobbies such as cooking or crafting sharing behind the scenes details of a video swapping tips and tricks for things like home improvement decorating or makeup tutorials with members in real time learning new things like a workout technique or musical skills and inviting special guests to join their watch party in our testing weve seen watch parties both big and small with highly engaged members often generating hundreds or even thousands of comments while watching videos together there were even groups that dedicated more than 10 hours to a single watch party with different members coming in and out throughout the day weve heard watch party can be useful for smaller communities too for example recently a group with fewer than 10 people recently hosted a watch party with more than 500 comments some describe how this shared viewing experience can be used to bridge distance between close friends and family when they cant physically be together imagine sitting down to watch a loved ones graduation video with your extended family when they couldnt be there in person reliving a vacation by sharing videos and swapping memories or even just hanging out with friends watching funny videos together the possibilities are endless for example the dogspotting society group has used watch party to enjoy funny and heartwarming dog videos together big ballers the official

test to limit forwarding that will apply to everyone using whatsapp in india where people forward more messages photos and videos than any other country in the world we ll also test a lower limit of 5 chats at once and we ll remove the quick forward button next to media messages we believe that these changes which we ll continue to evaluate will help keep whatsapp the way it was designed to be a

News"],"title":"How Users Help Shape Facebook","text":"it seems like every facebook product announcement calls out something that was heard from people as the motivation for creating the feature how exactly does facebook collect and process all that feedback to find out we sat down with the people who lead that work the user research team a lot of what user research is trying to do is help the product designers and engineers really understand who theyre building for and what their needs and wants are says david ginsberg ginsberg oversees a team of more than 100 researchers that focus on the facebook app from news feed to profiles to the search experience many tech companies rely on a range of research methods to learn more about what people want and need from their products and facebook is no exception some of the methods ginsbergs team uses involve talking to small groups of people and are exploratory in nature researchers might invite people to sit down for one on one interviews join focus groups or keep diaries about their experiences with the app over time on the other end of the spectrum researchers invite large groups of people to take surveys often via the facebook app itself tens of thousands of people opt into taking surveys every week using a mix of these methods product teams can learn a lot about what users care about and why the more intimate qualitative methods yield rich resonant anecdotes that help illustrate the nuances and complexities of peoples feelings about an issue while broader reaching quantitative methods like surveys help define how particular groups of people feel about different issues and how many people share those attitudes and with more than 2 billion people using facebook every month researchers have to carefully construct their study designs to make sure that theyre hearing from representative swathes of the community all over the world user feedback informs all phases of product development for example in january facebook announced that it would begin to adjust ranking to make news feed more about supporting more meaningful social interactions on facebook that shift was sparked by a number of inputs from academic research to responses to surveys run by the news feed research team which showed people wanted to see more posts from their friends and family since the initial shift in january the research team has continued to reach out to people through surveys interviews and diary studies to deepen their understanding of what people consider to be meaningful interactions with others recently the team has been looking to understand what types of interactions likes comments re shares etc are most meaningful to people and whether it matters how close someone is to the person theyre interacting with those learnings go on to influence ongoing updates to ranking as well as other products soliciting feedback from users is actually just one way facebook brings outside voices into the mix researchers as well as facebooks partnerships and policy teams regularly talk with experts in civil society the academy and elsewhere to ensure theyre up to date on the latest research and best practices what people do on the platform is an important implicit form of feedback that product teams take into account as well for example in the early days of facebook the only type of photo you could upload was your profile photo but then the company noticed an intriguing trend people were constantly switching their profile photos sometimes as often as once an hour they realized that people were trying to share more visual moments from their lives and so in 2005 facebook launched the ability to upload photos arrange them in albums and tag people facebook later became the most popular photo sharing service in the world looking at what people arent doing on the platform is a helpful insight as well earlier this year facebook removed the trending news feature because it was getting so little usage this is why its helpful that ginsberg and his researchers work closely with the analytics team that analyzes on platform trends with so many different types of feedback coming in a big part of the research teams work is understanding how all of those things come together to best understand what the community is asking for lauren scissors who leads news feed research says that for years people kept asking facebook to build a dislike button but when her team dug a little deeper through interviews and surveys the latent desire they heard from people was that they didnt feel that the like button captured the entire range of emotions they wanted to express that insight led to the 2016 launch of five new reactions adding love haha wow sad and angry to the classic thumbs up like ultimately the desire to express the full range of ones emotions is a prime example of a people problem a guiding concept that helps make sure teams are building something people will actually use instead of just something the company wants people to use a lot of the things were building on facebook are new ways to help people do things that they have been doing for years staying connected sharing about their lives learning about the world scissors explains if we only think about peoples motivations and desires through the lens of facebook were probably going to miss the deeper or even new ways we can help people connect share and learn see also how people help fight false news hard questions is spending time on social media bad for us facebook recently announced a major update to news feed heres whats changing"},{"id":"27190eab-b2be-436f-aa87-409ea7e254c1","platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/helping-creators-protect-their-content","date":"2018-07-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products

private group chats and eventually to community based chat rooms and your jokes helped me get through many a long day chat rooms are now in beta and being released to more subreddits daily check out r subchats or this post if youd like to see how it works guess what chicken butt more on that later for now hi im u ityoclys but if youre one of the 7 000 or so people who messaged the admins with your feedback on chat you may remember me better as u reddit chat feedback most people still dont know about reddit chat so for context over the past year weve been beta testing a few new chat features with a small group of you when we started we knew that most people didnt personally know other redditors since the core of the reddit experience is pseudonymous sharing and discussion so we wanted to make sure there was a place for people in the betas to test chat give feedback and have a bit of fun perhaps most importantly we wanted to get to know people using chat and learn from them to do this we made a new user u reddit chat feedback and added it to the top of everyones chat contacts list kind of like tom from myspace for some reasonim the one who volunteered to respond to all the early testers who chatted us up or as many as i could keep up with turns out that was a lot so far ive chatted with more than 7 000 people one on one its been fun and id like to share some of the things we learned this is my life now til chatting with strangers on the internet isnt so scary if you havent used aol in a while the idea of chatting with people who feel uninhibited and disguised behind bizarre usernames might give you pause this may seem especially true when you consider using chat as a feedback channel on a platform like reddit which is widely known for its passionate and vocal communities i was initially afraid that most people would bring out the pitchforks and unkind words i was pleasantly surprised to find that most people are actually quite nice the nature of real time direct chat seems to be especially disarming even when people initially lash out in frustration or to troll i found that if you talk to them and show them youre a regular human like them they almost always chill out beyond just chilling out people who are initially harsh or skeptical of new things will actually often change their minds sometimes they get so excited that they start to show up in unexpected places defending the thing they once strongly opposed in a way that feels more authentic than anything i could say tldr again dont be afraid listen to people and talk to them and everything will usually be fine people are good til people will give you excellent and actionable feedback if youre willing to listen chat as a feedback mechanism has been incredibly valuable its been a great way to gauge general sentiment as we introduce the new products and features were building but its also allowed the community to share direct feedback and poke holes in our ideas that directly impact our product roadmaps im a product designer i take pride in bringing clarity to our product and engineering ideas but i also recognize that one person or even an entire team working on something new will never match the insights that a community of passionate people can find being the voice of u reddit chat feedback has dramatically reinforced that framework both for myself and my team listing everything we learned about chat via chat would result in a novella but here are a few common themes that surfaced through chat feedback and how we adapted to them redditors like cats i do too in fact i have two and theyre very cute one of the most impactful and common learnings from testing chat was that on reddit it makes more sense for chat to serve a group dedicated to a specific topic than it does for one on one communication this is a bit obvious in retrospect but initially came as a surprise given so many of the chat platforms out there connect people who already know each other irl people on reddit dont usually know each other irl thats kind of the point which means they arent sure who to chat with without a common interest and 1 1 communication can feel a bit random and unnatural this understanding came to shape our roadmap in a big way we shifted our teams focus to building subreddit based chat rooms before giving access to direct chat to all redditors no one wants reddit to become insert generic social media platform here this is good neither do we personally i like a lot of social sites on the internet but one of the things i enjoy most about reddit is the freedom that it gives people to express themselves without worrying that their grandparents will judge them large group chat rooms need powerful easy to use moderation features we were pretty sure this was true but the validation we received via chat feedback was strong that said we made moderation features a major priority for our roadmap early in the process people want to discover and share awesome subreddits when you get to know someone in a real time context sometimes it becomes easier for you to understand their tastes and share stuff you think theyd like for instance i learned about r pigifs r fairiesridingcorgis and r specializedtools yes cat in french is chat til the internet is full of funny witty and weird people jk i already knew that ok so i didnt exactly learn about this via chat feedback but i thought you might like to experience some of the funnier things ive experienced so far in chat like the first time u reddit chat feedback reached the front page and the second time one day later thanks r madlads or the time i recited the alphabet with someone from a to az yes we cycled through the alphabet at least twice over a few days or the time someone sent me the entire script to star wars episode 3 we added a max message length after that one or the time i learned about snails anyway here you go t2p 1 month snails the more you learn til how to make it to the front page some very mad lads tricked me at and then tricked me again one point my chat inbox was absolute madness for at least a week but it was fun to be referenced on the front page chicken butt got em we want to keep learning using u reddit chat feedback as a way to get to know and learn from redditors has been fun and incredibly insightful we cant thank everyone who has talked with us and given feedback enough but wed like to hear more if you want to talk about chat on reddit share a cat fact or tell us about a niche subreddit please get in touch ill end with a cat fact did you know that a group of cats is called a clowder its true i learned it on reddit by the way should also check out the new community based chat rooms in beta if you havent already its a great way to discuss topics youre interested in with people you dont know in real life im in a bunch of them and id love to chat with

copy link copy link submit search search input news and events vidcon 2018 helping creators earn more money and build stronger communities by neal mohan chief product officer youtube jun 21 2018 copy link copy link i just stepped off the stage at vidcon a conference created from scratch by hank and john green in 2010 that brings together fans creators and industry leaders to celebrate the power of online video i talked about how over the last 13 years youtube has grown from an ambitious idea into a worldwide movement built on free expression and the power of openness with more than 1 9 billion logged in users who come to youtube every month and localized versions stretching across 90 countries and 80 languages were opening up the world to anyone with a cell phone and an internet connection youtube is a vibrant community where everyone has a voice every day creators use their voice to entertain spur action and bring about positive change thats why over the last year weve doubled down on building the products and tools that the creator community needs not only to thrive on youtube but to continue to develop the video platform of the future the next big steps for creator monetization youtube lets creators connect with their community and gives them the opportunity to earn money while doing what they love thanks to advertisers creators around the world have been able to build businesses creating an entirely new global economy thats seen incredible growth the number of creators earning five figures a year is up by 35 percent and the number of creators earning six figures is up by 40 percent as in previous years the vast majority of the revenue is coming from our advertising partners well continue investing here but we also want to think beyond ads creators should have as many ways and opportunities to make money as possible weve been working on new tools that not only help creators better engage with their fans they also enable them to make money while doing it this is an idea that really began last year with super chat a product that allows fans to purchase messages that stand out within a live chat weve seen tremendous success with super chat and have since expanded to ticketing merchandise channel memberships and more were also bringing creators and brands together to form unique marketing partnerships via famebit channel memberships with channel memberships viewers pay a monthly recurring fee of 4 99 to get unique badges new emoji members only posts in the community tab and access to unique custom perks offered by creators such as exclusive livestreams extra videos or shout outs channel memberships have already been available for a select group of creators on youtube as sponsorships weve seen a lot of creators find success with this new business model so well soon be expanding this to eligible channels with more than 100 000 subscribers on youtube under the new name channel memberships we hope to bring it to even more creators in the coming months creators who have already been experimenting with this feature on youtube have seen encouraging results since launching in january comedy creator mike falzone more than tripled his youtube revenue and traveling duo simon and martina have built a closer knit community and revamped a miniseries exclusively for their members in more than 30 countries from finland to the philippines merchandise merchandise has been a part of many creators businesses for a long time we want to make it easier for more creators to sell merch directly from their channel so weve built a product that allows them to do just that from shirts with a logo to phone cases with a creators face weve joined forces with teespring so creators can choose from over 20 merchandise items to customize and sell via a shelf on their channel this will be available to all eligible u s based channels with over 10 000 subscribers starting today and we plan to bring even more merchandising partners and creators in

news briefings and weekly deep dives that are exclusive to watch people tell us they want to stay informed about what is happening around them we are committed to ensuring the news that people see on

through res so we definitely wanted to support it natively on the redesign however before starting work on night mode we had to fix the way that we handled colors in our application we needed to update our system of colors to be more unified across the site removing ad hoc colors providing access to the colors in every product surface and setting up the website to support multiple color themes the design team worked hard on creating a smaller color system using one already in place for our native mobile apps as a basis this also allowed us to ensure that the experience was consistent over all our platforms it also improves the accuracy for our colors since relying on a key that automatically changes with night mode removes the risk of overlooking how a component should look in night mode we began implementing the new color system by going through each usage of the old one and replacing it with the new color system leveraging new designs the team had drawn up this effort touched more than 5000 lines of code and allowed us to remove a net 1500 lines of no longer necessary code this will also make changing colors going forward a lot easier since we only have to update them in one place these updates allowed us to develop a night mode theme which we rolled out to employees for testing a few weeks back now that the admins have spent some time squashing bugs we are

understand how we can make facebook better for everyone some of these changeslike reactions live video and gifs work well and go on to become globally available others dont and we drop them today were ending one of those tests the explore feed the explore feed was a trial response to consistent feedback we received from people over the past year who said they want to see more from friends and family in news feed the idea was to create a version of facebook with two different news feeds one as a dedicated place with posts from friends and family and another as a dedicated place for posts from pages to understand if people might like two separate feeds we started a test in october 2017 in six countries you gave us our answer people dont want two separate feeds in surveys people told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing and having two separate feeds didnt actually help them connect more with friends and family we think our recent changes to news feed that prioritize meaningful social interactions better address the feedback we heard from people who said they want to see more from friends and family those changes mean less public content in news feed like posts from businesses brands and media we also received feedback that we made it harder for people in the test countries to access important information and that we didnt communicate the test clearly were acting on this feedback by updating the way we evaluate where to test new products and how we communicate about them separately were also discontinuing the explore feed bookmark globally this week explore gave people a new feed of content to discover pages and public figures they hadnt previously followed we concluded that explore isnt an effective way for people to discover new

your local area we identify local publishers as those whose links are clicked on by readers in a tight geographic area if a story is from a publisher in your area and you either follow the publishers page or your friend shares a story from that outlet it might show up higher in news feed to start this change is taking effect in the us and we plan to expand to more countries this year you can always choose which news sources including local or national publications that you want to see at the top of your feed with our see first feature what this means for publishers as we announced earlier this month we expect the amount of news in news feed to go down as we focus on meaningful social interactions with family and friends over passive consumption we are prioritizing local news as a part of our emphasis on high quality news and with todays update stories from local news publishers may appear higher in news feed for followers in publishers geographic areas this change is one of the many signals that go into news feed ranking for more see our publisher guidelines there are no constraints on which publishers are eligible which means large local publishers will benefit as well as publishers that focus on niche topics like local sports arts and human interest stories that said small news outlets may benefit from this change more than other outlets because they tend to have a concentrated readership in one location this is just the beginning of our efforts to prioritize high quality news this update may not capture all small or niche interest publishers at first but we are working to improve precision and coverage over time all of our work to reduce false news misinformation clickbait sensationalism and inauthentic accounts still applies our commitment to local news weve worked closely with local publishers through the facebook journalism project over the last year visiting newsrooms around the world to provide training and support for journalists as well as building products that work for their publications and readers local news publishers participated in the majority of our collaborative product tests in 2017 including support for subscriptions in instant articles call to action units which are prompts for readers to like a publishers page or sign up for an email newsletter and a new breaking news format in news feed in addition to prioritizing local news we are also testing a dedicated section on facebook that connects people to news and information in their community called today in we are testing this in six us cities and plan to expand

representative sample of people using facebook across the us to gauge their familiarity with and trust in various different sources of news this data will help to inform ranking in news feed well start with the us and plan to roll this out internationally in the future informative content when we rank and make improvements to news feed we rely on a set of core values these values which weve been using for years guide our thinking and help us keep the central experience of news feed intact as it evolves one of our news feed values is that the stories in your feed should be informative for informative sources we will continue to improve on the work we first announced in august 2016 where we began asking people to rank the informativeness of updates in their feed on a scale of one to five were evaluating ways to expand this work to more areas this year local news finally people want more local news on facebook as we announced this month were making it easier for people to see

updates to ranking so people have more opportunities to interact with the people they care about mark outlined this in a post today what is the update today we use signals like how many people react to comment on or share posts to determine how high they appear in news feed with this update we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people to do this we will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about and show these posts higher in feed these are posts that inspire back and forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to whether thats a post from a friend seeking advice a friend asking for recommendations for a trip or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion we will also prioritize posts from friends and family over public content consistent with our news feed values what does this mean for pages and public content because space in news feed is limited showing more posts from friends and family and updates that spark conversation means well show less public content including videos and other posts from publishers or businesses as we make these updates pages may see their reach video watch time and referral traffic decrease the impact will vary from page to page driven by factors including the type of content they produce and how people interact with it pages making posts that people generally dont react to or comment on could see the biggest decreases in distribution pages whose posts prompt conversations between friends will see less of an effect can people still see posts from the pages they follow at the top of news feed yes people who want to see more posts from pages they follow can choose see first in news feed preferences to make sure they always see posts from their favorite pages what types of page posts will show higher in news feed page posts that generate conversation between people will show higher in news feed for example live videos often lead to discussion among viewers on facebook in fact live videos on average get six times as many interactions as regular videos many creators who post videos on facebook prompt discussion among their followers as do posts from celebrities in groups people often interact around public content local businesses connect with their communities by posting relevant updates and creating events and news can help start conversations on important issues using engagement bait to goad people into commenting on posts is not a meaningful interaction and we will continue to demote these posts in news feed does this mean you are eliminating page content from news feed no this update is not the same as the recent tests where all page content was moved to the

attempting to use your image as their profile picture were also introducing a way for people who are visually impaired to know more about who is in the photos they encounter on facebook people gave us feedback that they would find it easier to manage face recognition through a simple setting so were pairing these tools with a single on off control if your tag suggestions setting is currently set to none then your default face recognition setting will be set to off and will remain that way until you decide to change it know when you appear in photos on facebook now if youre in a photo and are part of the audience for that post well notify you even if you havent been tagged youre in control of your image on facebook and can make choices such as whether to tag yourself leave yourself untagged or reach out to the person who posted the photo if you have concerns about it we always respect the privacy setting people select when posting a photo on facebook whether thats friends public or a custom audience so you wont receive a notification if youre not in the audience profile photo safety we want people to feel confident when they post pictures of themselves on facebook so well

photos youre already tagged in and generates a string of numbers we call a template when photos and videos are uploaded to our systems we compare those images to the template you control whether facebook can recognize you in photos and videos soon you will begin to see a simple on off switch instead of settings for individual features that use face recognition technology we designed this as an on off switch because people gave us feedback that they prefer a simpler control than having to decide for every single feature using face recognition technology to learn more about all of these

help as quickly as possible facebook is a place where friends and family are already connected and we are able to help connect a person in distress with people who can support them its part of our ongoing effort to help build a safe community on and off facebook today we are sharing additional work were doing to help people who are expressing thoughts of suicide including using pattern recognition to detect posts or live videos where someone might be expressing thoughts of suicide and to help respond to reports faster improving how we identify appropriate first responders dedicating more reviewers from our community operations team to review reports of suicide or self harm over the last month weve worked with first responders on over 100 wellness checks based on reports we received via our proactive detection efforts this is in addition to reports we received from people in the facebook community we also use pattern recognition to help accelerate the most concerning reports weve found these accelerated reports that we have signaled require immediate attentionare escalated to local authorities twice as quickly as other reports we are committed to continuing to invest in pattern recognition technology to better serve our community expanding our use of proactive detection we are starting to roll out artificial intelligence outside the us except in the eu at present to help identify when someone might be expressing thoughts of suicide including on facebook live this will eventually be available worldwide this approach uses pattern recognition technology to help identify posts and live streams as likely to be expressing thoughts of suicide we continue to work on this technology to increase accuracy and avoid false positives before our team reviews we use signals like the text used in the post and comments for example comments like are you ok and can i help can be strong indicators in some instances we have found that the technology has identified videos that may have gone unreported improving how we identify first responders and dedicating more reviewers our community operations team includes thousands of people around the world who review reports about content on facebook the team includes a dedicated group of specialists who have specific training in suicide and self harm we are also using artificial intelligence to prioritize the order in which our team reviews reported posts videos and live streams this ensures we can get the right resources to people in distress and where appropriate we can more quickly alert first responders context is critical for our review teams so we have developed ways to enhance our tools to get people help as quickly as possible for example our reviewers can quickly identify which points within a video receive increased levels of comments reactions and reports from people on facebook tools like these help reviewers understand whether someone may be in distress and get them help in addition to those tools were using automation so the team can more quickly access the appropriate first responders contact information our ongoing commitment to suicide prevention already on facebook if someone posts something that makes you concerned about their well being you can reach out to them directly or report the post to us we have teams working around the world 24 7 who review reports that come in and prioritize the most serious reports we provide people with a number of support options such as the option to reach out to a friend and even offer suggested text templates we also suggest contacting a help line and offer other tips and resources for people to help themselves in that moment facebook has been working on suicide prevention tools for more than 10 years our approach was developed in collaboration with mental health organizations such as save org national suicide prevention lifeline and forefront suicide prevention and with input from people who have had personal experience thinking about or attempting suicide they are also available globally with the help of over 80 local partners in whatever language people use facebook in with the help of our partners and

facebook group admins since the summit weve been busy building tools and programs that will help them grow and manage their communities and today were announcing several of them new tools for admins and members welcome posts for admins welcoming new members and making them feel supported is critical to building community to help them introduce new members to the group admins can now write a welcome post that will automatically tag new joiners badges we also heard that members want ways to easily identify group leaders and other members thats why weve also introduced badges for group admins moderators and new members member profiles many people also tell us they often get to know other group members by reading their group posts and visiting their profiles to help make this easier were introducing a new feature called member profiles now when group members click on another persons name they will be directed to a group specific profile based on publicly available information like things they may share in common and a feed of that persons activity in the group new controls finally many admins spend hours each week making sure their facebook groups stay supportive and safe so weve built new features to help group admins grow and manage their communities weve expanded the group insights tool to include helpful personalized tips like scheduling posts at times when members are most engaged weve also heard that conversations in even the most supportive groups can sometimes get heated so weve created more tools for admins to manage members that might have forgotten group rules of conduct admins can now temporarily turn off a members ability to comment and post and remove members who violate their communitys rules from multiple groups they manage in a single click building relationships with group admins we loved getting to know group leaders at the facebook communities summit and we got to learn a lot more about the groups they manage for example we learned that most common categories of meaningful groups on facebook in the us include local city and neighborhood groups pregnancy and parenting groups animal and pet groups and occupation focused groups to give the admins of these groups more opportunities to connect with other community leaders we started an invite only group on facebook where they can connect with one another and share feedback about their experiences so we can provide the support they need to serve their communities were also exploring programs to help these leaders meet up in person and keep the connection going well be announcing more about these new programs soon leaders inspiring change since the facebook communities summit weve seen people use facebook groups to impact inspiring real world change in their

to patients and their family being responsible for finding donors to replace blood in the blood banks or hospitals this can cause high stress situations as people try to find blood donors on their own including by reaching out to their network on facebook we think we can help by finding ways to more efficiently bring blood donors and people in need together in india this drives thousands of people

find donors thats why today were announcing a new effort to make it easier for people to sign up to be donors and a new way to connect people and organizations with information and tools to find blood donors when needed we have worked together with nonprofit organizations health industry experts potential donors and people who have used facebook to find blood donors to ensure that what we are designing will be useful to people in india making it easier to become a blood donor starting october 1 national blood donor day facebook users in india will be able to start signing up to be blood donors to help encourage participation well show a message in news feed or people can edit their profiles to sign up all information will remain private and set to only me by default but people can choose to share their donor status on their timelines this will first be available on android and mobile web as these are the most widely used platforms in india connecting individuals and organizations with blood donors in the next few weeks well also make it easier for people and organizations such as blood banks and hospitals to connect with blood donors on facebook when individuals

facebook has the incredible power to connect people spark conversation and foster community on facebook videos are discovered through friends and bring communities together as more and more people enjoy this experience weve learned that people like the serendipity of discovering videos in news feed but they also want a dedicated place they can go to watch videos thats why last year we launched the video tab in the us which offered a predictable place to find videos on facebook now we want to make it even easier to catch up with shows you love introducing watch were introducing watch a new platform for shows on facebook watch will be available on mobile on desktop and laptop and in our tv apps shows are made up of episodes live or recorded and follow a theme or storyline to help you keep up with the shows you follow watch has a watchlist so you never miss out on the latest episodes watch is personalized to help you discover new shows organized around what your friends and communities are watching for example youll find sections like most talked about which highlights shows that spark conversation whats making people laugh which includes shows where many people have used the haha reaction and what friends are watching which helps you connect with friends about shows they too are following weve learned from facebook live that peoples comments and reactions to a video are often as much a part of the experience as the video itself so when you watch a show you can see comments and connect with friends and other viewers while watching or participate in a dedicated facebook group for the show a platform for shows watch is a platform for all creators and publishers to find an audience build a community of passionate fans and earn money for their work we think a wide variety of facebook shows can be successful particularly shows that engage fans and community nas daily publishes a daily show where he makes videos together with his fans from around the world the watchlist makes it easy for fans to catch every days new episode live shows that connect directly with fans gabby bernstein a new york times bestselling author motivational speaker and life coach uses a combination of recorded and live episodes to connect with her fans and answer questions in real time shows that follow a narrative arc or have a consistent theme tastemades kitchen little is a funny show about kids who watch a how to video of a recipe then instruct professional chefs on how to make it each episode features a new child a new chef and a new recipe unsurprisingly the food doesnt always turn out as expected live events that bring communities together major league baseball is broadcasting a game a week on facebook enabling people to watch live baseball while connecting with friends and fellow fans on the platform we think watch will be home to a wide range of shows from reality to comedy to live sports to help inspire creators and seed the ecosystem weve also funded some shows that are examples of community oriented and episodic video series for example returning the favor is a series hosted by mike rowe where he finds people doing something extraordinary for

Design"],"title":"Video Is Coming to Reddit!","text":"reddit is home to more than 100 000 of the internets most passionate and engaged communities and we want to give all of them the best tools to express themselves and engage in deeper conversations thats why were excited to announce the extended rollout of reddit video beta which makes it easier than ever for redditors to capture upload and share videos and gifs with all their favorite communities this launch is a giant step forward in our efforts to bring rich content to reddit following last years release of native image hosting and our introduction of native video ads earlier this year so what is reddit video hosting heres everything you need to know you can record video within the official reddit apps or select a pre recorded video from your gallery and upload it to reddit on desktop you can select a video from your files to upload allowed video file types are mp4 and mov with a maximum length of 15 minutes you can convert uploaded videos into mp4 gifs with our native gif converter on the mobile apps you can trim uploaded videos and gifs to just the section you want to feature best of all you can watch reddit video while you read comments and engage in conversation check it out by clicking this post and scrolling down why native video if youve spent any time on r highqualitygifs r mealtimevideos or just about any other reddit community you know that videos and gifs represent a major proportion of the content shared on our site but prior to this launch content creators had to go through a time consuming circuitous process to post videos using third party hosting platforms copying urls and sharing them as link posts this inhibited many users especially those who capture videos on their phones and want to share them quickly with their favorite subreddits with native video weve streamlined this process dramatically allowing both content creators and commenters to focus on the conversation taking place on reddit no third party uploads new tabs or back arrows necessary beta tests and user feedback of course given reddits scale implementing video hosting that could support our vast and varied userbase was a massive undertaking we also wanted to ensure that video would be available to redditors across all our platforms so we worked to launch hosting on ios android and desktop at the same time and to ensure were offering our users a best in class experience it was important to roll this out slowly soliciting feedback from individual redditors video and gif communities mod teams and content creators along the way as we began beta testing we found that the most engaging types of video werent coming from popular users trying to establish their individual brands as you might see on other platforms instead our video adopters so far have been creating and sharing videos to engage within their specific reddit communities as an organic extension of conversations already happening on each subreddit these users dont need to worry about building a huge subscriber base or posting to an abyss of content because theyre posting directly to the communities that share their passion redditors who attended teslas model 3 launch posted videos of the cars new features to r teslamotors and of course the pet lovers have already taken to reddit video to share their adorable doggos with communities like r aww throughout the beta process weve found that native video doesnt merely improve the content creating process it offers a unique new format for expression and interruption free engagement once the post is live because our video platform keeps a small preview window open at the top of the screen as you browse the comments below you can transition seamlessly between viewing lurking and commenting on reddit videos its already proving its value to our communities content creators publishing partners and brands who are eager to start using native video to engage in conversation with reddit communities in new ways your first reddit video we will continue to evolve reddit video as we collect additional feedback from our users so you can expect more updates in the coming months in the meantime if youd like to try out your first video or gif post heres a step by step guide to uploading desktop click submit link on a reddit video enabled subredditclick choose

world that looks interesting you can quickly tap open lens to snap a photo and find related ideas to get search and lens on your home feed update your ios app coming to android soon more and more people are searching for ideas were making it easier for people to search for ideas on their phones because thats what an increasing number of people are coming here to do monthly mobile text searches

60 percent over last year and our search returns 20 percent more pins with nearly four billion ideas getting served up each and every day what makes pinterest search so different more and more people are searching pinterest for ideas because what they find here is different from everywhere else traditional search engines are great for when people have something specific they want to know like whats the weather like today pinterest is where people come when theyre not quite sure what they want yet maybe theyre looking for ideas for what to do today or what to wear theyre open to possibilities and when they come across an idea that looks good they can explore related ideas until they find exactly what works best for them this kind of open minded searching is what makes pinterest so unique you dont need to know what somethings called or which brand made it you can start your search broad then quickly narrow in on the specific solution thats right for you in fact 73 percent of all pinterest traffic comes from people who start off their search with just one to three keywords and 97 percent of all searches on pinterest dont include a brand name so if youre someone like jacob who lives in portland or and needed a new jacket for those chilly northwestern nights you can poke around and discover the right style for you like this casual barbour coat thats now jacobs

exploring ways people can more easily add designs to profile pictures which our research has shown helpful in deterring misuse based on what we learn from our experience in india we hope to expand to other countries soon profile pictures are an important part of building community on facebook because they help people find friends and create meaningful connections but not everyone feels safe adding a profile picture in our research with people and safety organizations in india weve heard that some women choose not to share profile pictures that include their faces anywhere on the internet because theyre concerned about what may happen to their photos these tools developed in partnership with indian safety organizations like centre for social research learning links foundation breakthrough and youth ki awaaz are designed to give people more control over their experience and help keep them safe online new controls people in india will start seeing a step by step guide to add an optional profile picture guard when you add this guard other people will no longer be able to download share or send your profile picture in a message on facebook people youre not friends with on facebook wont be able to tag anyone including themselves in your profile picture where possible well prevent others from taking a screenshot of your profile picture on facebook which is currently available only on android devices well display a blue border and shield around your profile picture as a visual cue of protection deterring misuse based on preliminary tests weve learned that when someone adds an extra design layer to their profile picture other people are at least 75 less likely to copy that picture we partnered with jessica singh an illustrator who took inspiration from traditional indian textile designs such as bandhani and kantha to create designs for people to add to their profile picture if someone suspects that a picture marked with one of these designs is being misused they can report it to facebook and we will use the design to help determine whether it should be removed from our

in this section are some of the most popular stories about that topic on facebook these stories are determined the same way as the featured headline using a combination of factors including the engagement around the article on facebook the engagement around the publisher overall and whether other articles are linking to it there is no predetermined list of publications that are eligible to appear in trending and this update does not affect how trending topics are identified which we announced earlier this year making trending easier to discover on mobile one of the things we regularly hear from people who use trending is that it can be difficult to find in the facebook mobile app were soon beginning a test in news feed that will show people the top three trending stories which they can click on to see the full list of trending topics and explore what people are discussing on facebook while most people will not see trending in their news feed as part of this small test we hope that it will help us learn how to make trending as useful and informative for people as possible if you do see the trending unit in your news feed you have the option to remove it in the drop down menu which will prevent it from being shown to you in the future as before we continue to listen to feedback about trending and will keep making improvements in order to provide a valuable

time in fact people comment more than 10 times more on facebook live videos than on regular videos when it comes to compelling public broadcasts such as a breaking news event a q a with your favorite actor or behind the scenes action after a big game watching with the community and reading comments is an exciting part of the experience we know sometimes people also want the option to interact with only their friends during a public live broadcast so were rolling out live chat with friends live chat with friends lets you invite friends to a private chat about a public live broadcast you can invite friends who are already watching or other friends who you think may want to tune in youre able to jump back into the public conversation at any time and you can still continue chatting with your friends via messenger after the broadcast ends with live chat with friends you can be part of big moments with the wider community but also have the option to participate in personal conversations with the people closest to you directly within the live experience were testing this feature on mobile in several countries and we look forward to making it available more broadly later

News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Facebook’s Community Standards: How and Where We Draw the Line","text":"by monika bickert head of global policy management last month people shared several horrific videos on facebook of syrian children in the aftermath of a chemical weapons attack the videos which also appeared elsewhere on the internet showed the children shaking struggling to breathe and eventually dying the images were deeply shocking so much so that we placed a warning screen in front of them but the images also prompted international outrage and renewed attention on the plight of syrians reviewing online material on a global scale is challenging and essential as the person in charge of doing this work for facebook i want to explain how and where we draw the line on an average day more than a billion people use facebook they share posts in dozens of languages everything from photos to live videos a very small percentage of those will be reported to us for investigation the range of issues is broad from bullying and hate speech to terrorism and complex designing policies that both keep people safe and enable them to share freely means understanding emerging social issues and the way they manifest themselves online and being able to respond quickly to millions of reports a week from people all over the world for our reviewers there is another hurdle understanding context its hard to judge the intent behind one post or the risk implied in another someone posts a graphic video of a terrorist attack will it inspire people to emulate the violence or speak out against it someone posts a joke about suicide are they just being themselves or is it a cry for help in the uk being critical of the monarchy might be acceptable in some parts of the world it will get you a jail sentence laws can provide guidance but often whats acceptable is more about norms and expectations new ways to tell stories and share images can bring these tensions to the surface faster than ever we aim to keep our site safe we dont always share the details of our policies because we dont want to encourage people to find workarounds but we do publish our community standards which set out what is and isnt allowed on facebook and why our standards change over time we are in constant dialogue with experts and local organizations on everything from child safety to terrorism to human rights sometimes this means our policies can seem counterintuitive as the guardian reported experts in self harm advised us that it can be better to leave live videos of self harm running so that people can be alerted to help but to take them down afterwards to prevent copycats when a girl in georgia usa attempted suicide on facebook live two weeks ago her friends were able to notify police who managed to reach her in time we try hard to stay objective the cases we review arent the easy ones they are often in a grey area where people disagree art and pornography arent always easily distinguished but weve found that digitally generated images of nudity are more likely to be pornographic than handmade ones so our policy reflects that theres a big difference between general expressions of anger and specific calls for a named individual to be harmed so we allow the former but dont permit the latter these tensions between raising awareness of violence and promoting it between freedom of expression and freedom from fear between bearing witness to something and gawking at it are complicated and there are rarely universal legal standards to provide clarity being as objective as possible is the only way we can be consistent across the world but we still sometimes end up making the wrong call the hypothetical situations we use to train reviewers are intentionally extreme theyre designed to help the people who do this work deal with the most difficult cases when we first created our content standards nearly a decade ago much was left to the discretion of individual employees but because no two people will have identical views of what defines hate speech or bullying or any number of other issues we now include clear definitions we face criticism from people who want more censorship and people who want less we see that as a useful signal that we are not leaning too far in any one direction i hope that readers will understand that we take our role extremely seriously for many of us on the team within facebook safety is a passion that predates our work at the company i spent more than a decade as a criminal prosecutor investigating everything from child sexual exploitation to terrorism our team also includes a counter extremism expert from the uk the former research director of west points combating terrorism center a rape crisis center worker and a teacher all of us know there is more we can do last month we announced that we are hiring an extra 3 000 reviewers this is demanding work and we will continue to do more to ensure we are giving them the right support both by making it easier to escalate hard decisions quickly and by providing the psychological support they need technology has given more people more power to communicate more widely than ever before we believe the benefits of sharing far outweigh the risks but we also recognize that society is still figuring out what is acceptable and what is harmful and that we at facebook can play an important part of that conversation"},{"id":"39f1b443-f460-4571-b4b3-07bf482dd340","platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-location-and-hashtag-story-exploration","date":"2017-05-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing

where things are restricted mode is designed to be an optional feature that helps filter out more mature content from view so that institutions like schools and libraries as well as people who prefer a more limited experience would feel comfortable offering access to youtube we want to clarify that restricted mode should not filter out content belonging to individuals or groups based on certain attributes like gender gender identity political viewpoints race religion or sexual orientation what were fixing back in march our community alerted us that our systems were not working as intended in particular that we were unintentionally filtering content from restricted mode that shouldn t have been after a thorough investigation we started making several improvements to restricted mode on the engineering side we fixed an issue that was incorrectly filtering videos for this feature and now 12 million additional videos of all types including hundreds of thousands featuring lgbtq content are available in restricted mode were listening we also spent time over the last few weeks talking with creators and third party organizations to better understand their experiences and questions one thing we heard loud and clear was peoples desire to report videos they believed were being inappropriately excluded from restricted mode starting today were providing a form to allow creators and viewers alike to give us feedback about this we will use this input to help improve our automated system going forward more transparency about how restricted mode works we also heard that many people simply wanted to know what gets a video taken out of restricted mode here are some clearer guidelines creators should think about if they want their videos to appear in restricted mode discussion and

i turned on the community contributions tool after a subscriber asked me to so that he could translate my videos and share them with his friends alex said knowing that my community valued my content enough to want to share it and to go the extra mile to do so really meant a lot to me alexs videos have since been translated to mandarin french hebrew and more but whos behind those translations we also wanted to hear from passionate viewers who translate content for creators they love to date over 900k contributors have helped translate videos on youtube this includes people like tee ponsukcharoen a stanford student who spends an average of 10 hours a week translating content on youtube hes written translations for over 2 500 videos translating content to me now is like washing my face brushing my teeth or working out it s a part of my daily routine that i do without thinking much tee said there are three components that drive my motivation to translate videos autonomy mastery and purpose translating content on youtube serves all three he said i can choose videos that i am interested to translate i sharpen my english thai and the subject of the video every time that i translated finally i know that my translation will be beneficial to other people some thai students who don t know english well can use my subtitles to learn better our work can be used as language

months and most definitely over the last few days from lgbtq and other communities weve gotten lots of questions around what restricted mode is and how it works we understand that this has been confusing and upsetting and many of you have raised concerns about restricted mode and your content being unfairly impacted the bottom line is that this feature isnt working the way it should were sorry and were going to fix it we introduced restricted mode back in 2010 as an optional feature to help institutions like schools as well as people who wanted to better control the content they see on youtube we designed this feature to broadly restrict content across more mature topics whether these are videos that contain profanity those that depict images or descriptions of violence or discussion of certain diseases like addictions and eating disorders today about 1 5 percent of youtubes daily views come from people who have restricted mode turned on but we know this isnt about numbers its about the principle of anyone having access to important content and different points of view you can read more about how restricted mode works here our system sometimes make mistakes in understanding context and nuances when it assesses which videos to make available in restricted mode for instance the following videos are examples of where we got it wrong ash hardells her vows calum mcswiggans coming out to grandma jono and bens woman interrupted during bbc interview and tegan and saras bwu official music video while the system will never be 100 percent perfect as we said up top we must and will do a better job thanks to your feedback weve manually reviewed the example videos mentioned above and made sure theyre now available in restricted mode well also be using this input to better train our systems it will take time to fully audit our technology and roll out new changes so please bear with us theres nothing more important to us than being a platform where anyone can

safety check has been activated hundreds of times but we know we can do more to empower the community to help one another with community help people can find and give help and message others directly to connect after a crisis posts can be viewed by category and location making it easier for people to find the help they need again we saw the community do this on their own through groups and posts like in the aftermath of the flooding in chennai india in december 2015 but we knew we could do more we also talked with experts humanitarian relief organizations and our own in the field researchers to learn how to make it easier for people to find and give help to start we will make community help available for natural and accidental incidents such as an earthquake or building fire were also

then select turn off commenting you can also tap the menu any time after posting to turn commenting back on in the coming weeks were also adding the ability to like comments by tapping a heart icon next to any comment liking lets you show support and encourages positivity throughout the community ability to remove followers from private accounts some people on instagram choose to have private accounts which means they approve each follower this is an important way for people to feel comfortable sharing with close friends and family in the past once you approved a follower there was no simple way to undo that decision without blocking them going forward if your account is private you can remove followers by going to your list of followers and tapping the menu next to any persons name the person will not be notified that you removed them as a follower anonymous reporting for self injury posts finally we want to continue to be a place where people can share deeply personal moments from time to time you may see friends struggling and in need of support if you believe that someone you care about may be thinking about injuring themselves you can report it anonymously and

youtube by tom leung product management for creator dec 16 2016 copy link copy link at youtube we want to make it as easy as possible for fans to find and watch your channel that s why we ve spent years building the tools to help your audience stay on top of your videos from subscriptions to notifications and even custom urls last year we announced that youtube no longer requires a google profile when you want to upload comment or create a channel as part of this change today were launching a new custom url system that works independently from google and also unifies your identity across youtube currently we have two systems for claiming a custom url a youtube system that generates urls in this format youtube com channelname a system integrated with google that generates urls like this youtube com c channelname with these two systems in place we began to see instances where two channels could request urls with similar names in these two different formats this is confusing for fans and not a great experience for creators either our new system will fix that problem with todays launch both urls from the older systems will now point to the same channel this means that in our previous example users can now reach the same channel with either youtube com channelname or youtube com c channelname and with a new system in place well also avoid duplicating channel names in the future this also means that claiming a new youtube custom url does not involve a custom url for your google profile and vice versa we believe this is a positive change for the millions of channels that have custom urls today as well as those who will request one in the future however as we make this transition there is a group of less than 0 02 of channels with custom urls who will have to claim a new url due to duplication conflicts when youtube com channelname and youtube com c channelname point to different channels if you are part of this group you will be notified and can claim a brand new custom url from your channels advanced account settings until may 31 2017 to make this change we are making every effort to work with creators to find a solution that supports their needs on youtube thats why we created custom urls in the first place and were excited about how this change will benefit both fans and creators in the long term related topics products and

on how this works if both you and the content id claimant want to monetize your video we will continue to run ads against it and hold those funds separately while the dispute is resolved while you can dispute a content id claim at any time the vast majority of disputes are made within the first 5 days of a claim being placed on your videos our new system is designed accordingly if you choose to dispute a claim within the first 5 days of receiving it we will hold revenue from the day the content id claim was placed if you choose to dispute a content id claim after 5 days of the original claim we will start holding the revenue on the date the dispute is made read more about how this works here as always thanks to everyone for sharing feedback about our copyright processes were always working to improve our systems with the goal of empowering creators with the freedom of opportunity to build a business and succeed on your own terms david rosenstein content id product manager original post from 4 28 16 at youtube one of our core values is a belief in the freedom of opportunity we believe anyone should have the opportunity to earn money from the videos they create and turn their channels into successful businesses thats why we opened up the youtube partner program nine years ago and why we remain the only platform where anyone with an idea and a camera can turn their videos into full time jobs we understand just how important revenue is to our creator community and weve been listening closely to concerns about the loss of monetization during the content id dispute process currently videos that are claimed and disputed dont earn revenue for anyone which is an especially frustrating experience for creators if that claim ends up being incorrect while a video racks up views in its first few days today were announcing a major step to help fix that frustrating experience were developing a new solution that will allow videos to earn revenue while a content id claim is being disputed heres how it will work when both a creator and someone making a claim choose to monetize a video we will continue to run ads on that video and hold the resulting revenue separately once the content id claim or dispute is resolved well pay out that revenue to the appropriate party were working on this new system now and hope to roll it out to all youtube partners in the coming months heres a closer look at how itll work once its live we strongly believe in fair use and believe that this improvement to content id will make a real difference in addition to our work on the content id dispute process were also paying close attention to creators concerns about copyright claims on videos they believe may be fair use we want to help both the youtube community and copyright owners alike better understand what fair use looks like online which is why we launched ourfair use protection programlast year and recently introducednew help center pageson this topic even though content id claims are disputed less than 1 of the time we agree that this process could be better making sure our content id tools are being used properly is deeply important to us so weve built a dedicated team to monitor this using a combination of algorithms and manual review this team has resolved millions of invalid claims in the last year alone and acted on millions more before they impacted creators the team also restricts feature access and even terminates a partners access to content id tools if we find they are repeatedly abusing these tools we will continue to invest in both people and technology to make sure that content id keeps working for creators and rightsholders we want to thank everyone whos shared their concerns about unintended effects from content id claims its

watch wwe wrestling and wanted to show us his favorite video but after he found it and tapped to play the video just wouldnt load maybe it was his phone or his 2g connection but it just wouldnt work unfortunately this story isnt an exception for our indian viewers they love youtube and its amazing selection of bollywood hits comedy vlogs cricket matches andyeseven wrestling but even as they discover the joys of youtube their experience is not great on slower connections and less powerful mobile phones weve always believed that connectivity should not be a barrier to watching youtube in 2014 we launched youtube offline so you could watch videos without suffering from buffering a few months ago we rolled out smart offline a feature that allows you to schedule videos to be saved offline later at off peak times when theres more bandwidth so data is faster and cheaper but we realized that for the next generation of youtube users to fully discover all that youtube has to offer we had to reimagine the youtube mobile app from the ground up thats why i and a team of engineers designers and researchers have been travelling to india collecting ideas and testing prototypes with hundreds of people across 15 cities theyve helped us build a brand new youtube app thats faster more relevant and more affordable with innovative new features meet youtube go a new youtube app built from scratch to bring youtube to the next generation of viewers youtube go is designed with four concepts in mind its relatable with video recommendations and a user interface that is made for you the app is designed to be offline first and work even when theres low or no connectivity its also cost effective providing transparency and reducingdata usage and finally its a social experience

content they believe violates our community guidelines and we often hear questions about what happens to a video after youve flagged it when a flag is received the reported content is always reviewed by youtube before being removed we have internal teams from around the world who carefully evaluate reports 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year and these teams remove content that violates our policies or are careful to leave content up if it hasnt crossed the line back in 2012 we noticed that certain people were particularly active in reporting community guidelines violations with an extraordinarily high rate of accuracy from this insight the trusted flagger program was born to provide more robust tools for people or organizations who are particularly interested in and effective at notifying us of content that violates our community guidelines as part of this program trusted flaggers receive access to a tool that allows for reporting multiple videos at the same time once content is flagged our trained teams review them to determine whether to remove the flagged videos or not our trusted flaggers results around flagging content that violates our community guidelines speak for themselves their reports are accurate over 90 of the time this is three times more accurate than the average flagger given the success of the trusted flagger program we want to do more to empower the people who contribute to youtube in other ways thats why were introducing youtube heroes a program designed to recognize and support the global community of people who consistently help make youtube a better experience for everyone these heroes do this in big and small ways by adding captions subtitles to videos reporting videos that violate our community guidelines or sharing their knowledge with others in our help forums the program is now available to a select group of contributors from across the globe who have histories of high quality community contributions people who are interested in joining the program can express interest here and we will gradually admit other top contributors into the program youtube heroes will have access to a dedicated youtube heroes community site that is separate from the main youtube site where participants can learn from one another through the program participants will be able to earn points and unlock rewards to help them reach the next level for example level 2 heroes get access to training through exclusive workshops and hero hangouts while level 3 heroes who have demonstrated their proficiency will be able to flag multiple videos at a time something trusted flaggers can already do and help moderate content strictly within the youtube heroes community site a sneak peek at the new youtube heroes community site youtube heroes will also be able to track their own contributions and see their overall impact they can easily find out when a video they reported has been removed by youtube for violation of our policies a subtitle they contributed has been approved by the creator or a help forum answer theyve posted has been marked as best answer a look at how youtube heroes can track their contributions to kick the program off we brought our first class of youtube heroes together for the first time this week at a two day summit at youtube hq meet our first class of youtube heroes its early days for the program and we will continue to roll out the details of youtube heroes and the dedicated youtube heroes community site over the coming months were excited to learn through this initial launch and to

content has shifted to the internet online experiences have improved dramatically becoming more immersive and intuitive but many digital ads havent kept up weve all experienced a lot of bad ads ads that obscure the content were trying to read ads that slow down load times or ads that try to sell us things we have no interest in buying bad ads are disruptive and a waste of our time today were announcing some changes to help with this problem first were expanding the tools we give people to control their advertising experience second were providing an update on our approach to ad blocking on facebook what weve done so far for the past few years at facebook weve worked to better understand peoples concerns with online ads what weve heard is that people dont like to see ads that are irrelevant to them or that disrupt or break their experience people also want to have control over the kinds of ads they see as a result of what weve learned weve introduced tools to help people control their experience improved how we decide which ads to show and created new ad formats that complement rather than detract from peoples experience online improving ad controls with todays announcement were building on these efforts by making ad preferences easier to use so you can stop seeing certain types of ads if you dont want to see ads about a certain interest like travel or cats you can remove the interest from your ad preferences we also heard that people want to be able to stop seeing ads from businesses or organizations who have added them to their customer lists and so we are adding tools that allow people to do this these improvements are designed to give people even more control over how their data informs the ads they see addressing ad blocking when theyre relevant and well made ads can be useful helping us find new products and services and introducing us to new experiences like an ad that shows you your favorite band is coming to town or an amazing airline deal to a tropical vacation but because ads dont always work this way many people have started avoiding certain websites or apps or using ad blocking software to stop seeing bad ads these have been the best options to date weve designed our ad formats ad performance and controls to address the underlying reasons people have turned to ad blocking software when we asked people about why they used ad blocking software the primary reason we heard was to stop annoying disruptive ads as we offer people more powerful controls well also begin showing ads on facebook desktop for people who currently use ad blocking software some ad blocking companies accept money in exchange for showing ads that they previously blocked a practice that is at best confusing to people and that reduces the funding needed to support the journalism and other free services that we enjoy on the web facebook is one of those free services and ads support our mission of giving people the power to share and making the world more open and connected rather than paying ad blocking companies to unblock the ads we show as some of these companies have invited us to do in the past were putting control in peoples hands with our updated ad preferences and our other advertising controls we believe that these expanded controls give people a better experience with advertising on and off facebook we also know theres more work to do and were continually listening to your feedback to make advertising better for

Feed FYI","Product News"],"title":"Building a Better News Feed for You","text":"by adam mosseri vp product management news feed the goal of news feed is to show people the stories that are most relevant to them today were announcing an update to news feed that helps you see more posts from your friends and family we explain this change in more detail here when we launched news feed in 2006 it was hard to imagine the challenge we now face far too much information for any one person to consume in the decade since more than a billion people have joined facebook and today they share a flood of stories every day thats why stories in news feed are ranked so that people can see what they care about first and dont miss important stuff from their friends if the ranking is off people dont engage and leave dissatisfied so one of our most important jobs is getting this ranking right as part of that process we often make improvements to news feed and when we do we rely on a set of core values these values which weve been using for years guide our thinking and help us keep the central experience of news feed intact as it evolves in our continued efforts to be transparent about how we think about news feed we want to share those values with you news feed values our success is built on getting people the stories that matter to them most if you could look through thousands of stories every day and choose the 10 that were most important to you which would they be the answer should be your news feed it is subjective personal and unique and defines the spirit of what we hope to achieve friends and family come first facebook was built on the idea of connecting people with their friends and family that is still the driving principle of news feed today our top priority is keeping you connected to the people places and things you want to be connected to starting with the people you are friends with on facebook thats why if its from your friends its in your feed period you just have to scroll down to help make sure you dont miss the friends and family posts you are likely to care about we put those posts toward the top of your news feed we learn from you and adapt over time for example if you tend to like photos from your sister well start putting her posts closer to the top of your feed so you wont miss what she posted while you were away our research has also shown us that after friends and family people have two other strong expectations when they come to news feed your feed should inform people expect the stories in their feed to be meaningful to them and we have learned over time that people value stories that they consider informative something that one person finds informative or interesting may be different from what another person finds informative or interesting this could be a post about a current event a story about your favorite celebrity a piece of local news or a recipe were always working to better understand what is interesting and informative to you personally so those stories appear higher up in your feed your feed should entertain weve also found that people enjoy their feeds as a source of entertainment for some people thats following a celebrity or athlete for others its watching live videos and sharing funny photos with their friends we work hard to try to understand and predict what posts on facebook you find entertaining to make sure you dont miss out on those a platform for all ideas we are not in the business of picking which issues the world should read about we are in the business of connecting people and ideas and matching people with the stories they find most meaningful our integrity depends on being inclusive of all perspectives and view points and using ranking to connect people with the stories and sources they find the most meaningful and engaging we dont favor specific kinds of sources or ideas our aim is to deliver the types of stories weve gotten feedback that an individual person most wants to see we do this not only because we believe its the right thing but also because its good for our business when people see content they are interested in they are more likely to spend time on news feed and enjoy their experience its important to note that while we welcome a multitude of viewpoints we also believe strongly that people should feel and be safe when they use facebook and we therefore have community standards that define the behavior that we think is out of bounds on the platform we think its possible to be inclusive without making facebook a place where people are subjected to attacks hate or other harmful behavior authentic communication the strength of our community depends on authentic communication the feedback weve gotten tells us that authentic stories are the ones that resonate most thats why we work hard to understand what type of stories and posts people consider genuine so we can show more of them in news feed and we work to understand what kinds of stories people find misleading sensational and spammy to make sure people see those less you control your experience ultimately you know whats most meaningful to you and thats why weve developed controls so you can customize what you see features such as unfollow hide and see first help you design your own experience and when you use them we take your actions as feedback to help us better understand what content is most important to you for example if you hide a story from someone that signals that youre less interested in hearing from that person in the future as news feed evolves well continue building easy to use and powerful tools to give you the most personalized experience constant iteration we view our work as only 1 percent finished and are dedicated to improving along the way as we look for ways to get better we will continue soliciting feedback we will be as open as we can providing explanations in news feed fyi wherever possible and looking for opportunities to share how we work"},{"id":"2f6049d5-c2fc-49cb-b939-468c5b765c23","platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/whats-app-calling-100-million-conversations-every-day","date":"2016-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"WhatsApp

half of people who use pinterest are from outside the united states weve been working harder than ever to make sure our app and website are easy to use no matter where you live or what language you

more utilitarian save instead we were amazed by just how many new pinners started saving ideas on pinterest especially people from outside the us in spite of the impressive numbers we still really struggled with the decision to make the change we have a lot of love for our pin it button which has served us well for so long but the most important thing is for pinterest to feel welcoming to

News"],"title":"Information About Trending Topics","text":"by justin osofsky vp global operations at facebook we stand for connecting every person for a global community for bringing people together for giving all people a voice for a free flow of ideas and culture across nations one of the most powerful ways people connect is around major events in their communities and in the larger world people also connect through conversations on the topics they are most interested in at its core trending topics is designed to help people discover major events and meaningful conversations trending topics is a feature we added in 2014 separate from a persons news feed to help people discover content that is both popular in the world and meaningful to them topics that are eligible to appear in the product are surfaced by our algorithms not people this product also has a team of people who play an important role in making sure that what appears in trending topics is high quality and useful the trending topics team is governed by a set of guidelines meant to ensure a high quality product consistent with facebooks deep commitment to being a platform for people of all viewpoints our goal has always been to deliver a valuable experience for the people who use our service the guidelines demonstrate that we have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to discriminate against sources of any political origin period here are the guidelines we use here is an overview of how trending topics works surfaced by algorithm potential trending topics are first surfaced by an algorithm that identifies topics that have recently spiked in popularity on facebook in other words ones that have a high volume of mentions and a sharp increase in mentions over a short period of time the trending topics algorithm also uses an external rss website crawler to identify breaking events so that we can connect people to conversations on facebook about newsworthy events as quickly as possible a list of included websites is available here reviewed by the trending topics team members of the trending team look at potential trending topics as they are surfaced by the algorithm and do the following confirm that the topic is tied to a current news event in the real world for example the topic lunch is talked about during lunch every day around the world but will not be a trending topic write a topic description with information that is corroborated by reporting from at least three of a list of more than a thousand media outlets a list of these media outlets is available here apply a category label to the topic ex sports science to help with personalized ranking and to enable suggestions grouped by category for the various tabs on the desktop version check to see whether the topic is national or global breaking news that is being covered by most or all of ten major media outlets and if it is the topic is given an importance level that may make the topic more likely to be seen a list of these outlets is available in the guidelines personalized the list of trending topics is then personalized for each user via an algorithm that relies on a number of factors including the importance of the topic pages a person has liked location for example home state sports news feedback provided by the user about previous trending topics and whats trending across facebook overall not everyone sees the same topics at the same time the trending search results page when you click on a trending topic you are taken to a search results page that includes all the news sources and posts that are covering the topic the articles and posts that appear here are also surfaced algorithmically trending is also integrated into facebook search so you can search for any trending topic that may not show up in your trending suggestions faq q why was trending topics created trending topics was launched in 2014 to surface the major conversations happening on facebook it has evolved over time and remains a work in progress trending topics is a relatively limited part of the facebook experience appearing on the right hand side on desktop as well as when you tap on the search box in the mobile app and primarily for people using facebook in english there are limited tests being run in spanish and portuguese q how do you protect against bias in the trending topics product first and foremost the algorithm that surfaces topics eligible for review optimizes for popularity and frequency on facebook and whether it is a real world event and does not consider perspective or politics second we have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum as well as to eliminate noise that does not relate to a current newsworthy event but might otherwise be surfaced through our algorithm facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to discriminate against sources of any political origin period the guidelines that govern our review do not permit the suppression of political perspectives do not permit the prioritization of one ideological viewpoint over another lastly we regularly audit the work of members of our review team to ensure that it complies with the guidelines violating the guidelines is a fireable offense q have reviewers been instructed by facebook to inject specific stories into trending topics to suppress conservative news sites no and the guidelines do not permit reviewers to add or suppress political perspectives q what does injecting mean could someone who is reviewing the trending topics artificially inject a topic into trending topics potential trending topics are first surfaced by an algorithm that identifies topics that have recently spiked in popularity on facebook or are suggested by an external rss website crawler to identify breaking news events if in this process a topic is detected that should connect to a linguistically similar but distinct topic ex the lego movie vs lego the toy the reviewer may replace the topic id by injecting a more accurate topic id similarly we might inject odile as a better way to represent a hurricane occurring in cabo san lucas than the topics baja and cabo which might be surfaced by the algorithm injection helps improve trending topics over time by surfacing higher quality topics it is not used to promote articles or topics from a particular perspective q can reviewers remove or suppress political topics they dont like by blacklisting them the guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives about 40 of the topics in the queue get rejected by the reviewers because they reflect what is considered noise a random word or name that lots of people are using in lots of different ways for example braised dvd weekend and sale are all topics that were not accepted as trends over the past week this tool is not used to suppress or remove articles or topics from a particular perspective q is facebook investigating whether employees did manipulate the trending topics list in ways alleged in the gizmodo stories yes we take these reports very seriously and will continue to investigate the allegations we have found no evidence to date that trending topics was successfully manipulated but will continue the review of all our practices update clearer language around trending topics after last weeks report were continuing to look into trending topics and our guidelines as part of that process we have begun to test out some ways to make our terminology more clear blacklist has been changed to revisit this refers to the ability to remove junk hashtags from the trending topics list about 40 of the topics in the queue get rejected by the reviewers because they reflect what is considered noise a random word or name that lots of people are using in lots of different ways or a word that is is duplicative of something thats already trending this tool may not be used to suppress or remove articles or topics from any particular perspective these topics are removed from the list for a period of time usually 24 hours but can be less if the topic is still surfaced by our algorithms after the time has elapsed it will reappear in the trending topics tool for a second review injection has been changed to topic correction topics that are eligible to appear in the product are surfaced by our algorithms not people if in this process a topic is detected that connects to another topic in the list the reviewer may replace the topic id by injecting a more accurate topic id for example we might inject odile as a better way to represent a hurricane occurring in cabo san lucas than the topics baja and cabo which might be surfaced by the algorithm injection helps improve trending topics over time by surfacing higher quality topics it may not be used to promote articles or topics from a particular perspective"},{"id":"80d3440f-300e-4b73-815d-d949e002b8f9","platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-whats-app-s-desktop-app","date":"2016-05-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Introducing

for creators by david rosenstein content id group product manager apr 28 2016 copy link copy link at youtube one of our core values is a belief in the freedom of opportunity we believe anyone should have the opportunity to earn money from the videos they create and turn their channels into successful businesses thats why we opened up the youtube partner program nine years ago and why we remain the only platform where anyone with an idea and a camera can turn their videos into full time jobs we understand just how important revenue is to our creator community and weve been listening closely to concerns about the loss of monetization during the content id dispute process currently videos that are claimed and disputed dont earn revenue for anyone which is an especially frustrating experience for creators if that claim ends up being incorrect while a video racks up views in its first few days today were announcing a major step to help fix that frustrating experience were developing a new solution that will allow videos to earn revenue while a content id claim is being disputed heres how it will work when both a creator and someone making a claim choose to monetize a video we will continue to run ads on that video and hold the resulting revenue separately once the content id claim or dispute is resolved well pay out that revenue to the appropriate party were working on this new system now and hope to roll it out to all youtube partners in the coming months heres a closer look at how itll work once its live we strongly believe in fair use and believe that this improvement to content id will make a real difference in addition to our work on the content id dispute process were also paying close attention to creators concerns about copyright claims on videos they believe may be fair use we want to help both the youtube community and copyright owners alike better understand what fair use looks like online which is why we launched our fair use protection program last year and recently introduced new help center pages on this topic even though content id claims are disputed less than 1 of the time we agree that this process could be better making sure our content id tools are being used properly is deeply important to us so weve built a dedicated team to monitor this using a combination of algorithms and manual review this team has resolved millions of invalid claims in the last year alone and acted on millions more before they impacted creators the team also restricts feature access and even terminates a partners access to content id tools if we find they are repeatedly abusing these tools we will continue to invest in both people and technology to make sure that content id keeps working for creators and rightsholders we want to thank everyone whos shared their concerns about unintended effects from content id claims its allowed us to create a better system for everyone and we hope to share more updates soon

advancements in object recognition technology people using screen readers on ios devices will hear a list of items a photo may contain as they swipe past photos on facebook before today people using screen readers would only hear the name of the person who shared the photo followed by the term photo when they came upon an image in news feed now we can offer a richer description of whats in a photo thanks to automatic alt text for instance someone could now hear image may contain three people smiling outdoors this is possible because of facebooks object recognition technology which is based on a neural network that has billions of parameters and is trained with millions of examples each advancement in object recognition technology means that the facebook accessibility team will be able to make technology even more accessible for more people when people are connected they can achieve extraordinary things as individuals and as a community and when everyone is connected we all

happy to announce that whatsapp will no longer charge subscription fees for many years we ve asked some people to pay a fee for using whatsapp after their first year as we ve grown we ve found that this approach hasn t worked well many whatsapp users don t have a debit or credit card number and they worried they d lose access to their friends and family after their first year so over the next several weeks we ll remove fees from the different versions of our app and whatsapp will no longer charge you for our service naturally people might wonder how we plan to keep whatsapp running without subscription fees and if today s announcement means we re introducing third party ads the answer is no starting this year we will test tools that allow you to use whatsapp to communicate with businesses and organizations that you want to hear from that could mean communicating with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent or with an airline about a delayed flight we all

happen people need to feel safe and be confident they know who they are communicating with on facebook we require people to use the name their friends and family know them by when people use the names they are known by their actions and words carry more weight because they are more accountable for what they say it also makes it harder for bullies to anonymously smear the reputations of others or anyone else to use an anonymous name to harass scam or engage in criminal behavior were firmly committed to this policy and it is not changing however after hearing feedback from our community we recognize that its also important that this policy works for everyone especially for communities who are marginalized or face discrimination thats why were continuing to make improvements in this area today we will begin to test new tools that address two key goals first we want to reduce the number of people who are asked to verify their name on facebook when they are already using the name people know them by second we want to make it easier for people to confirm their name if necessary these tools have been built based on many conversations with community leaders and safety organizations around the world a new version of names reporting that requires people to provide context we are introducing a new version of the names reporting process that requires people to provide additional information about why they are reporting a name in the past people were able to simply report a fake name but now they will be required to go through several new steps that provide us more specifics about the report this additional context will help our review teams better understand why someone is reporting a name giving them more information about a specific situation a new way for people to describe their special circumstance when verifying their name were also testing a new tool that will let people provide more information about their circumstances if they are asked to verify their name people can let us know they have a special circumstance and then give us more information about their unique situation this additional information will help our review teams better understand the situation so they can provide more personalized support this information will also help inform potential improvements we can make in the future in addition to these two improvements over the last year we made several other changes to our processes to make sure they work for everyone we expanded the options and documents that everyone on facebook can use to verify their name we started rolling out a new process in which people will have access to their account for seven days while they verify or update their name we also implemented additional security protections for documents that people share with us when they are verifying their name these improvements are only the beginning early in the new year we will be looking at other ways we can reduce the number of people who have to go through an id verification experience while preserving the safety of other people on the site we will also continue to work on making the experience itself more compassionate and easier to navigate throughout this process we will continue our ongoing conversations with the facebook community so they can share their thoughts on improvements theyd like to see these tools are currently being tested on a limited basis in the us only across mobile and desktop based on feedback we will iterate and roll them out globally we want to create the best experience that we can for everyone and we will continue

and exploited children to send amber alerts to the facebook community to help find missing children the new initiative will deliver amber alerts to peoples news feeds in targeted search areas after a child has been abducted and the national center has issued an alert these alerts which include photographs and other details about the missing child are shown on mobile and desktop people can share the alert with friends and link directly to the national centers missing child poster which always has the most up to date information about the case for years people have used facebook to post news articles about missing children and amber alerts in several cases someone saw a post or photo in their news feed took action and a child was safely returned in 2014 an 11 year old girl was safely recovered after a motel owner recognized her from an amber alert that a friend had shared on facebook the woman called the police and the child was found unharmed its amazing word of mouth efforts like this that inspired us to develop a more systematic way to help find missing children on facebook we know the chances of finding a missing child increase when more people are on the lookout especially in the critical first hours our goal is to help get these alerts out quickly to the people who are in the best position to help heres how it works when local or state police determine that a case qualifies for an amber alert the alert is issued by the national center for missing and exploited children and distributed through the facebook system with any available information including a photograph of the missing child a license plate number the name and description of the child and suspected abductor law enforcement determines the range of the target area for each alert the number of alerts people will see depends on how many alerts are issued in their area some people may see a few each year and many people will likely get no alerts at all the alerts will appear in news feed but will not trigger any notifications to a persons phone with more than 725 children recovered as a direct result of amber alerts since the program launched in 1996 we know the system works we hope our new delivery mechanism will help increase that number and reunite even more families"},{"id":"10042cd1-9ac4-45b1-ba50-b773dbf026ea","platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/an-update-on-promoted-pins","date":"2014-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product"],"title":"An

News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Introducing Safety Check","text":"by naomi gleit vp of product management sharon zeng product manager peter cottle software engineer in times of disaster or crisis people turn to facebook to check on loved ones and get updates it is in these moments that communication is most critical both for people in the affected areas and for their friends and families anxious for news we want to provide a helpful tool that people can use when major disasters strike so weve created safety check a simple and easy way to say youre safe and check on others during a major disaster safety check will help you let friends and family know youre safe check on others in the affected area mark your friends as safe only your friends will see your safety status and the comments you share the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan was devastating according to the japanese red cross more than 12 5 million people were affected nationwide and more than 400 000 people were evacuated during that crisis we saw how people used technology and social media to stay connected with those they cared about our engineers in japan took the first step toward creating a product to improve the experience of reconnecting after a disaster they built the disaster message board to make it easier to communicate with others they launched a test of the tool a year later and the response was overwhelming unfortunately these kinds of disasters happen all too frequently each time we see people relief organizations and first responders turn to facebook in the aftermath of a major natural disaster these events have taught us a lot about how people use facebook during disasters and we were personally inspired to continue work on the disaster message board to incorporate what weve learned this project soon became safety check which will be available globally on android ios feature phones and desktop the team set out to create a simple and easy to use tool that allows people to connect with their network of friends and family when it matters most heres how it works when the tool is activated after a natural disaster and if youre in the affected area youll receive a facebook notification asking if youre safe well determine your location by looking at the city you have listed in your profile your last location if youve opted in to the nearby friends product and the city where you are using the internet if we get your location wrong you can mark that youre outside the affected area if youre safe you can select im safe and a notification and news feed story will be generated with your update your friends can also mark you as safe if you have friends in the area of a natural disaster and the tool has been activated you will receive a notification about those friends that have marked themselves as safe clicking on this notification will take you to the safety check bookmark that will show you a list of their updates if youre ever in a situation that would require you to use safety check we hope its a tool that helps you stay connected to those you care about and gives you the comfort of knowing your loved ones are safe update as of 11 19 15 we created safety check to help in times of crisis and activated it eight times between october 2014 and november 2015 after natural disasters including the recent earthquakes in nepal the paris attacks in november 2015 was the first time we activated the tool for a crisis other than a natural disaster read more from our vice president of growth alex schultz about why we made that decision and how it impacts our approach to safety check going forward update as of 11 17 2016 initially facebook decided when safety check was activated but our goal has always been to make it more useful for people for more types of incidents we believe people closest to a disaster should play a bigger role in deciding when safety check is most helpful as of november 2016 safety check will be turned on by our community instead of facebook how this works is that once an incident occurs a third party source alerts facebook as part of that process the incident is automatically titled in line with the third party alert if a lot of people in the area are talking about the incident they may be invited to mark themselves safe and invite others to do the same through safety check"},{"id":"09ae9c50-c421-4d60-846d-84a82d3a5120","platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/09/introducing-facebook-media/","date":"2014-09-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product

proud icon or youve seen your friend check in at a coffee shop drinking an iced coffee in the last year people shared more than 5 billion status updates that included these kinds of feelings and activities sparking conversations with friends in a more visual way today were making those conversations quicker and easier by introducing a new way to share and discover music tv and movies when

to share that youre listening to your favorite beyonce track or watching the season premiere of game of thrones you can do it quickly and easily without typing heres how it works if youve turned the

you choose who can see it you can also turn the feature off at any time by clicking the audio icon in the top right of the screen if you leave the feature on you will see the audio icon move and

misunderstandings about how this product works we want to clear them up myth people have to use this new feature fact nope this feature is completely optional if you dont turn it on we wont use your microphone to try and match tv or music when you write a status update if you do choose to turn it on and later decide its not for you you can easily turn it off at any time myth the feature listens to and stores your conversations fact nope no matter how interesting your conversation this feature does not store sound or recordings facebook isnt listening to or storing your conversations heres how it works if you choose to turn the feature on when you write a status update the app converts any sound into an audio fingerprint on your phone this fingerprint is sent to our servers to try and match it against our database of audio and tv fingerprints by design we do not store fingerprints from your device for any amount of time and in any event the fingerprints cant be reversed into the original audio because they dont contain enough information myth facebook is always listening using your microphone fact nope if you choose to turn this feature on it will only use your microphone for 15 seconds when youre actually writing a status update to try and match music and tv myth facebook is automatically posting what youre listening to fact we do not automatically post anything about what youre listening to if youve chosen to use this feature and we find a match you choose whether you want to include the tv show or song in your status update myth facebook is storing the information from this feature indefinitely fact if youve chosen to use this feature and we find a match you get to choose whether you post that youre listening to a particular song or tv show that post will then appear on facebook for as long as you choose and to whatever audience you choose just like any other update if we find a match and you dont post we log that a particular song or tv show was matched but we dont connect this with your profile in any way we use this to keep a chart of the most watched and listened to songs and tv shows if we dont find a match we log that we failed we dont store the fingerprint"},{"id":"51619f90-db2a-4b50-8445-ab4aac10670c","platform":"WhatsApp","url":"https://blog.whatsapp.com/500-000-000","date":"2014-04-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"500,000,000","text":"thanks

on offering as many people as possible the chance to stay connected with friends and loved ones no matter who they are or where they live unfortunately there has also been a lot of inaccurate and careless information circulating about what our future partnership would mean for whatsapp users data and privacy id like to set the record straight above all else i want to make sure you understand how deeply i value the principle of private communication for me this is very personal i was born in ukraine and grew up in the ussr during the 1980s one of my strongest memories from that time is a phrase id frequently hear when my mother was talking on the phone this is not a phone conversation ill tell you in person the fact that we couldnt speak freely without the fear that our communications would be monitored by kgb is in part why we moved to the united states when i was a teenager respect for your privacy is coded into our dna and we built whatsapp around the goal of knowing as little about you as possible you don t have to give us your name and we don t ask for your email address we dont know your birthday we dont know your home address we dont know where you work we dont know your likes what you search for on the internet or collect your gps location none of that data has ever been collected and stored by whatsapp and we really have no plans to change that if partnering with facebook meant that we had to change our values we wouldnt have done it instead we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously our fundamental values and beliefs will not change our principles will not change everything that has made whatsapp the leader in personal messaging will still be in place speculation to the contrary isnt just baseless and unfounded its irresponsible it has the effect of scaring people into thinking were suddenly collecting all kinds of new data thats just not true and its important to us that you know that make no mistake our future partnership with facebook will not compromise the vision that brought us to this point our focus remains on delivering the promise of whatsapp far and wide so that people around the world have the freedom to speak their mind without fear"},{"id":"516afa2a-0045-42c0-9ba0-d693444ca00d","platform":"Pinterest","url":"https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/a-more-mobile-pinterest","date":"2014-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News","Product"],"title":"A

member and they usually ask for their loved ones timeline to be memorialized over the past several months weve been thinking about and working on better ways for people to remember loved ones as we continue to think through each aspect of memorialization we ask ourselves questions that have no easy answers how might people feel are we honoring the wishes and legacy of the person who passed away are we serving people who are grieving the loss of a loved one as best we can based on conversations inspired by these questions weve decided to make an important change to how we preserve legacies on facebook up to now when a persons account was memorialized we restricted its visibility to friends only this meant that people could no longer see the account or any of its content unless they were facebook friends with the person who passed away starting today we will maintain the visibility of a persons content as is this will allow people to see memorialized profiles in a manner consistent with the deceased persons expectations of privacy we are respecting the choices a person made in life while giving their extended community of family and friends ongoing visibility to the same content they could always see today were also glad to begin offering a way for anyone who has suffered the loss of a loved one to see that persons look back video in recognition of our ten year anniversary a group of our engineers created personal movies for people using some of the posts and photos they had shared over the years for one man in missouri the look back video he was most desperate to watch was one that had not yet been made john berlin reached out to ask if it was possible for facebook to create a video for his son jesse who passed away in 2012 we had not initially made the videos for memorialized accounts but johns request touched the hearts of everyone who heard it including ours since then many others have asked us to share the look back videos of their loved ones too and were now glad to be able to fulfill those requests video requests can be made here changes like this are part of a larger ongoing effort to help people when they face difficult challenges like bereavement on facebook we will have more to share in the coming months as we continue to think through how best to help people decide how they want to be remembered and what they want to leave behind for loved

the right content to the right people at the right time whether its from a close friend or a news source halfway across the world in the last year more people found news on facebook than ever before in fact as reported in october average referral traffic from facebook to media sites has increased by over 170 almost tripled in the past year todays update to news feed ranking recognizes that people want to see more relevant news and what their friends have to say about it more relevant articles in feed people use facebook to share and connect including staying current on the latest news whether its about their favorite celebrity or whats happening in the world weve noticed that people enjoy seeing articles on facebook and so were now paying closer attention to what makes for high quality content and how often articles are clicked on from news feed on mobile what this means is that you may start to notice links to articles a little more often particularly on mobile why are we doing this our surveys show that on average people prefer links to high quality articles about current events their favorite sports team or shared interests to the latest meme starting soon well be doing a better job of distinguishing between a high quality article on a website versus a meme photo hosted somewhere other than facebook when people click on those stories on mobile this means that high quality articles you or others read may show up a bit more prominently in your news feed and meme photos may show up a bit less prominently to complement peoples interest in articles we recently began looking at ways to show people additional articles similar to ones they had just read soon after you click on a link to an article you may see up to three related articles directly below the news feed post to help you discover more content you may find interesting comment stories while trying to show more articles people want to read we also dont want people to miss the conversations among their friends so were updating bumping to highlight stories with new comments after people read a story they are unlikely to go back and find that story again to see what their friends were saying about it and it wouldnt bump up in news feed with this update stories will occasionally resurface that have new comments from friends as a result people may start seeing a few more stories returning to their feed with new comments highlighted our testing has shown that doing this in moderation for just a small number of stories can lead to more conversations between people and their friends on all types of content well continue to keep you posted on the updates we make in response to peoples feedback stay tuned for more"},{"id":"4b70daf2-5faf-4c0b-b603-e085f1e8d0ed","platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-on-youtube-comments","date":"2013-11-24T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products

building a simple app that has inspired creativity while capturing everyday moments through the lens of your mobile phone in fact our focus on building out a mobile only experience is a unique path that weve chosen for many reasons the most important of which is that instagram at its core is about seeing and taking photos on the go however to make instagram even more accessible to our growing community at the end of last year we started to expand to the desktop web giving you the ability to see profiles from instagram com to continue that path as of today you can now browse your instagram feed on the web just like you do on your mobile device go to instagram com and log in to your account to give it a try your instagram feed on the web functions much like it does on your mobile phone you can browse through the latest photos of people whom you follow with updates as people post new photos like photos by double clicking on them or pressing the like button or engage in a conversation around a photo with inline commenting browse through pages of the most recent images to keep up on whats happening with the people you follow in realtime and shrink your browser down to a single column for your feed to look more like your mobile feed simply put weve brought a simple powerful and beautiful instagram browsing experience to the web we believe that you should be able to access instagram on a variety of different devices any of which may be convenient to you at a given moment including your desktop computer or tablet we do not offer the ability to upload from the web as instagram is about producing photos on the go in the real world in realtime on the other hand instagram for the web is focused on making the browsing experience a fast simple and enjoyable one this

search began rolling out we highlighted a set of upgraded privacy tools on facebook encouraging people to review what theyve shared the upgraded privacy tools and the reminder to use them are part of an ongoing effort to encourage people to make choices that are right for them privacy works consistently across facebook not just on graph search when you control who you share your information with

choose whether that information is shared with public friends only me custom or specific lists of people graph search is aware of these privacy settings go to your activity log to review and control who can see what you share on facebook how do i control the audience of my likes you control who you share your interests and likes with on facebook to do this go to your timeline and click the likes box at the top each category of interests and likes has its own privacy setting if for example you choose to only let your friends see your interests then your friends are the only people who will see that you like those interests anywhere on facebook in news feed on your timeline and in graph search for pages that are not part of a category you can see and change the privacy of these likes under the other pages you like section can people see things about my friends through graph search you can choose who can see your friend and family lists across facebook on your timeline in news feed and graph search just as you control who can see your friend lists your friends control who can see their friend lists someone might be able to tell that youre friends with another person and search based on that friendship if they can see your friendship on the other persons timeline so if youre concerned about people searching for info about your friends you can ask your friends to limit who can see their friends list as well some people have asked us why search works this way the reason is that we want people to be clear on who can see info about them not only in graph search but elsewhere on facebook such as on timeline or in news feed privacy controls work consistently across facebook how do i view and control what photos of me are on facebook last year we launched improved privacy tools that let people see what theyve shared to see what photos have been tagged of them and to be able to take action if theres something they dont like in activity log you can now review all posts and

more than a billion people more than 240 billion photos and more than a trillion connections today were announcing a new way to navigate these connections and make them more useful were calling it graph search and it starts today with a limited preview or beta when facebook first launched the main way most people used the site was to browse around learn about people and make new connections graph search takes us back to our roots and allows people to use the graph to make new connections graph search will appear as a bigger search bar at the top of each page when you search for something that search not only determines the set of results you get but also serves as a title for the page you can edit the title and in doing so create your own custom view of the content you and your friends have shared on facebook graph search and web search are very different web search is designed to take a set of keywords for example hip hop and provide the best possible results that match those keywords with graph search you combine phrases for example my friends in new york who like jay z to get that set of people places photos or other content thats been shared on facebook we believe they have very different uses another big difference from web search is that every piece of content on facebook has its own audience and most content isnt public weve built graph search from the start with privacy in mind and it respects the privacy and audience of each piece of content on facebook it makes finding new things much easier but you can only see what you could already view elsewhere on facebook were very early in the development of graph search its only available in english today and you can search for only a subset of content on facebook posts and open graph actions for example song listens are not yet available well be working on these things over the coming months the first version of graph search focuses on four main areas people photos places and interests people friends

also want them to watch your videos too youtube search is optimized for watch time so you are rewarded for the more time your viewers spend watching your videos so be thoughtful about when to keep your fans watching videos versus sending them to buy your merch talking about your merch in a video is also a great way to let fans know which products you are promoting and more importantly why they

nearly five years since we launched content id it has helped everyone from large media companies to up and coming creators manage their content when it appears on youtube more than 3 000 content owners have supplied more than 500 000 hours of reference files to the system content id hasnt stood still over the last five years weve been rolling out regular updates and we want to highlight three particular efforts that we think improve content id for everyone a new appeals processusers have always had the ability to dispute content id claims on their videos if they believe those claims are invalid prior to today if a content owner rejected that dispute the user was left with no recourse for certain types of content id claims e g monetize claims based upon feedback from our community today were introducing an appeals process that gives eligible users a new choice when dealing with a rejected dispute when the user files an appeal a content owner has two options release the claim or file a formal dmca notification smarter detection of unintentional claimscontent owners have uploaded more than ten million reference files to the content id system at that scale mistakes can and do happen to address this weve improved the algorithms that identify potentially invalid claims we stop these claims from automatically affecting user videos and place them in a queue to be manually reviewed by the content owner this process prevents disputes that arise when content not owned by a partner inadvertently turns up in a reference file smarter claim detection minimizes unintentional mistakes of course we take action in rare cases of intentional misuse up to and including terminating content id access improved matching qualityat the heart of content id is the matching technology that identifies partners content among all the videos on youtube earlier this year we introduced a significant improvement to how the matching happens we continue to work on ways to make the matching more precise through better algorithms and a more comprehensive reference library there is still a lot of work ahead of us but we believe that these are significant steps forward in our efforts to keep youtube a vibrant place where the rights of both content owners and users are protected and everyone can control their original content and make money from it money which can be put towards the

custom thumbnails to everyone as weve mentioned before we focus on watch time when suggesting videos because it improves overall audience engagement on youtube and opens up more revenue opportunities for you well continue to recommend videos whose thumbnails help drive viewers to actually watch them over videos that are clicked and then quickly abandoned when custom thumbnails do not accurately reflect the content they represent they can annoy and disappoint viewers these videos perform poorly on watch time so they will become less prominent on youtube were continuing to test how partners use this feature to see how they better drive viewership on youtube over the next few weeks we ll be granting access in weekly batches to partners partners need to have been active for 30 days and in

why we focus on watch time by eric meyerson head of content creator communications aug 10 2012 copy link copy link this is the first of a series called youtube now which well use to explain how were evolving the site and why would you like to suggest a topic of interest to creators for a future youtube now please drop it in the comments below todays topic why we surface videos that drive watch time youtube viewers watch a lot of video over 4 billion hours a month at last count but the average household also watches several hours of video per day on their tvs so for youtube to become the most important media in more people s lives we ve got a lot of growing to do over the past few months we have made some changes to youtube to encourage people to spend more time watching interacting and sharing with the community to support this weve updated what we call video discovery features meaning how our viewers find videos to watch via search and suggested videos these changes better surface the videos that viewers actually watch over those that they click on and then abandon why this shift our video discovery features were previously designed to drive views this rewarded videos that were successful at attracting clicks rather than the videos that actually kept viewers engaged cleavage thumbnails anyone now when we suggest videos we focus on those that increase the amount of time that the viewer will spend watching videos on youtube not only on the next view but also successive views thereafter if viewers are watching more youtube it signals to us that theyre happier with the content theyve found it means that creators are attracting more engaged audiences it also opens up more opportunities to generate revenue for our partners these changes have so far proved very positive primarily less clicking more watching we saw the amount of time viewers spend watching videos across the site increase immediately and this positive trend has continued as weve made additional tweaks to our suggestions improvements in the stats we measure such as average view duration provide a solid indication that the videos we are recommending throughout the site are even more engaging how can creators thrive in this new world the best thing creators can do to be successful on youtube is make videos that people want to watch simple isnt it unfortunately many of the tactics weve heard from creators to optimize for youtubes discovery features may in fact backfire for example weve heard from some creators who intentionally made their videos shorter in an attempt to get a higher retention rate unfortunately this wont help while high retention on your videos is a good indication of engagement we are actually optimizing for how a video contributes to a longer viewing session on youtube so your video isnt more likely to be seen just because its shorter conversely weve also heard from some creators who intentionally made their videos longer assuming that longer videos lead to more watch time this also isnt necessarily true because it can be more challenging to keep viewers engaged through a longer video think of a comedy sketch that drags on just a little too long as a result our primary recommendation is to simply continue making the great videos your audience loves and stay away from questionable optimization strategies watch your dataand heres how were about to make this easier for you in the next few weeks we will provide enhanced watch time information in youtube analytics in sum we aim to give you as much information about watch time as we do about views today you ll start to see this in youtube analytics in the next few weeks in the meantime we currently offer a downloadable report available with time watched data you can use this data to better understand what your audience wants to watch more time watching your content means a more engaged audience and more revenue for you thats what our focus on watch time is all about related

allows you to obscure faces within videos with the click of a button whether you want to share sensitive protest footage without exposing the faces of the activists involved or share the winning point

publish you will see a preview of what your video will look like with faces blurred when you save the changes to your video a new copy is created with the blurred faces you will then be given the option to delete the original video this is emerging technology which means it sometimes has difficulty detecting faces depending on the angle lighting obstructions and video quality its possible that certain faces or frames will not be blurred if you are not satisfied with the accuracy of the blurring as you see it in the preview you may wish to keep your video private visual anonymity in video allows people to share personal footage more widely and to speak out when they otherwise may not because human rights footage in particular opens up new risks to the people posting videos and to those filmed its important to keep in mind other ways toprotect yourself and the people in your videos youtube is proud to be a destination where people worldwide come to share their stories including activists along with efforts like the human rights channel and citizentube that curate these voices we hope that the new technologies were rolling out will facilitate the sharing of even more stories

according to the publish time not upload time whats new with standard publishing notify subscribers at time published i e first set public not time uploaded worked for days on a video you kept private only to publish it publicly and have it show up deep into viewers feeds no bueno now videos will show up in channel and homepage feeds based on the time you mark them public rather than the original upload time we also now use time published in all other search and discovery features throughout the site so you dont have to worry about keeping videos private for a bit before publishing no more 0 published our old system wouldnt send videos until they processed on all formats 720p 1080p etc which could sometimes take a while now no more than a few minutes will pass between when your video is ready to watch and when it goes out to your subscribers whats new with scheduled publishing now when you use scheduled publishing well keep your video private until the time you specify the video will be sent to subscribers and appear chronologically throughout the site at the scheduled publish time not upload time to give you more visibility into publishing status weve added information to your video manager that lets you see when your video will publish in your local time zone once complete youll see a check mark with the confirmed published time were not done were not ready to declare

creator playbook a resource of best practices and tips you can start using on your channel and videos right away understanding the data behind your youtube channel can mean the difference between a good channel and a great one and were working to make it easy for you with youtube analytics since launching video analytics features in 2008 weve worked to build a powerful tool that can help you understand your channel content and audience on youtube here are three things that you should do today with youtube analytics find out what keeps people watching wonder which specific points in your videos are most interesting to your audience or where their interest is falling off the two types of audience retention graphs absolute retention and relative retention analyze audience retention on a per video basis absolute retention shows viewer retention as a percentage of total views remember rewinding and re watching can result in values higher than 100 while fast forwarding or abandoning the video will push the graph downwards check out the youtube analytics graph for barely politicals avengers therapy session 15 video below six seconds in absolute retention is 92 and it stays fairly consistent throughout the video its typical to see drop offs at the end of videos during credits or other footage when the main content ends as always try to keep viewer engagement up as long as possible relative retention shows how your video compares to videos of a similar length you should always strive to create engaging content for your viewers since watch time is a key indicator for suggested and recommended videos try to understand why certain videos keep your audience engaged and why others are poor performers then make programming and creative decisions based on your assessments learn how people find you how do your viewers ultimately find your youtube videos playlists or channel youtube analytics traffic sources provides a detailed look at how your viewers discover your content on a channel and per video level it shows you the top traffic sources that contributed to the largest percentage of total views if youre trying out a new metadata strategy thumbnail optimization or blog outreach initiative track how traffic sources change over time for example if you notice that annotations within a specific video cause a big spike in views you should take a closer look and try to replicate those best practices in other videos figure out what makes people subscribe the subscription report shows which videos drive the most subscriptions showing what resonates with your most loyal followers building up your subscriber base is crucial to audience development on youtube so understanding this metric is really important examine the dates or videos where there was a high gain or loss of subscribers and look into why this is happening identify key content trends that drive up your subscriptions and then apply those success strategies elsewhere

youtube team may 23 2012 copy link copy link theres always a lot going on here at youtube and were constantly making changes to improve the experience for the entire community in the last seven years there have been no fewer than 100 changes to the suggested and recommended video algorithms to provide viewers with the most relevant videos to watch we also make changes to improve the experience for partners recently weve made changes to provide you with more accurate data about your audience which in turn helps inform the decisions you make about your content in the short term however the impact for some creators can be a bit of a shock lets outline what weve done and whats in it for you subscriber counts in the past few months we have been scrubbing youtube of inactive and closed accounts why because these accounts had been inactive for years were not linked to our more up to date and secure systems and well nobody uses them this had the knock on effect of some creators seeing a drop in subscribers however this change benefits partners in the long term by giving you a better understanding of who is engaging with your channel accurate data is key and as such we will now be removing accounts from subscriber counts as they are closed as the accounts are inactive these changes wont affect viewership starting this saturday your subscriber counts on your channel and in analytics will be consistent and analytics will show you closed accounts that have been removed weve also heard some viewers are concerned that theyve been unsubscribed from channels this isnt happening you can see all your channel subscriptions by selecting and saving everything from the view drop down view count changes back in march we announced changes to the algorithm that serves up suggested and recommended videos giving greater weight to a viewers time spent on a video rather than to their click we did this because flipping through channels to find something to watch is different than actually watching and view counts that accurately reflect engagement are more useful what does this mean for you well if people are clicking on your videos but not sticking around to watch your videos won t get shown as often in suggested and recommended videos and growth in new views may slow the best way to prevent this is to create compelling videos that people stick around for also check out the the analytics audience retention report and these optimization tips for how to drive engaged views to your videos while transitions can be hard the data directly resulting from these changes is really encouraging net daily subscriptions are up 50 since january and watch time has been increasing in the past 2 months were investing to grow this this even more over the next year as we spend

counts by david boyle youtube staff may 16 2012 copy link copy link over the past couple weeks weve heard from creators who have seen decreases in their public subscriber counts so we wanted to keep you in the loop about what to expect on your channel this february we began a process to improve the accuracy of your subscriber counts to give you the best data possible on your channel recently weve extended this process by removing additional closed and inactive accounts from our system which means these closed accounts are being deducted from subscriber counts none of the accounts were removing from our system are active so these changes to subscriber counts will not cause any change in viewership the number of accounts removed varies from day to day so you may notice unusual declines in subscriber counts on one day followed by a return to normal performance the next day we plan to complete the account removals process over the coming weeks with a significant number of closed accounts being removed on one day we will update this blog when we have an expected date of completion and on that date its possible to see a drop in your public subscriber counts as well as in youtube analytics how much this will affect your channel will vary but the longer youve been on youtube the more likely it is you have inactive subscribers these account removals have already started to take effect in public counts and api counts through sites like vidstatsx but we will not be able to update the counts in youtube analytics until we have completed the account removals for the time being youtube analytics only captures subscribes and unsubscribes from active users which is a more meaningful metric for tracking engagement with your channel than the public counts we want your subscriber counts and all other analytics to be consistent and accurate so thanks for bearing with us as we make these improvements related topics products and

conversion technology works at youtube since last september weve been constantly improving the underlying technology which now uses several techniques we use a combination of video characteristics such as color spatial layout and motion to estimate a depth map for each frame of a monoscopic video sequence we use machine learning from the growing number of true 3d videos on youtube to learn video depth characteristics and apply them in depth estimation the generated depth map and the original monoscopic frame create a stereo 3d left right pair that a stereo display system needs to display a video as 3d with this broader knowledge of 3d conversion we then apply cloud computing scalability to make conversion possible across even more videos on youtube breaking up a video into tiny chunks of data and processing them in parallel on googles cloud infrastructure lets us process these videos while still producing the quality you expect wed love to hear your feedback and other

memorable and sharable we re updating our related and recommended videos to better serve videos that keep viewers entertained for years the related and recommended videos we served to the right of the

today this system serves videos based on the number of clicks they receive which would be like suggesting a tv show based on how many people briefly flipped on a channel while surfing but clicks arent always the best way to predict whether youll be interested in a video sometimes thumbnails dont paint the whole picture or a video title isnt descriptive weve been experimenting with the way we offer related and recommended videos focusing on video engagement to get people to the videos they like more quickly in particular weve discovered that time watched is one of the best indicators of a viewer s engagement as a result well be focusing more prominently on time watched in providing related and recommended videos starting next week while we ll still be looking at clicks engagement will become the leading indicator for serving these videos so if youre making videos that keep people engaged related and recommended videos will begin showing your videos more prominently on the flip side videos that dont will not be surfaced as prominently which will impact a videos viewcounts over time how can you adapt to these changes the same as you always have create great videos that keep people

than tripling the number of captioned videos available since july 2011 youtube and googles video accessibility team have been hard at work and we wanted to let you know about some of our progress over the past few months for youtube viewers more languages we now support automatic captions and transcript synchronization in japanese korean and english speech recognition for those languages makes it easier for video owners to create captions from a plain transcript video owners can also add captions and subtitles in 155 supported languages and dialects from afar to zulu in movies and shows you can even find out which subtitle languages are available before deciding to rent search for videos with captions looking for that great quote from a video on youtube add cc to any search or after searching click filter cc to only see results with closed captions caption settings while watching a video you can change the way the captions look by clicking on the cc icon and then the settings menu item this includes changing the font size or colors used and were planning to make this available on other platforms and add more options soon broadcast caption support if the channel owner provides a video caption file in a broadcast format we now support its position and style information just like youd see on tv this means the text can appear near the character who is speaking italicized to indicate an off camera narrator or even scrolling if the original captions were generated in a real time mode check out this littledemo from cpcto see how it looks or even watch a rental

captions with cea 608 encoding we ll import the captions along with the video and create youtube captions for example the nonprofit organization public resource org recently added thousands of public

tapes lying around in our vaults and attics particularly those that were produced by governments and others that care about accessibility of their videos already have closed captions embedded in them pulling that information out automatically and making it visible on youtube means that these videos will continue to be accessible to new generations of viewers wilderness rangers keeping it wild along with the millions of people like myself who rely on captions and subtitles we were very encouraged when the federal communications commission published rules governing closed captioning

accounts from all user subscriber counts on thursday february 9th a mentioned previously all users will see a one time adjustment to their total subscriber counts for further details about how this affects your channel you should view youryoutube analytics subscribers reports update 1 11 12 we will be holding off on the single day adjustment the january 12th date is being postponed until we can address some discrepancies we found in synchronizing the public counts with youtube analytics everyone involved in this project is determined to ensure that this change is clearly understood by users so we will postpone the single day adjustment until we can ensure that both the public count and youtube analytics data are consistent and unambiguous we will let everyone know once we have a firm date in mind however the enhanced techniques for despamming new subscriptions will be implemented as scheduled tomorrow as there are no such complications we will continue to keep everyone up to date on how this develops 1 10 12 at youtube we take the accuracy of subscriber counts seriously subscriber counts are a reflection of a creators level of engagement with viewers and a serious source of pride in the community many creators also use subscriber counts to measure their expectations for how many views their new videos should receive by comparing total subscriber counts to number of views received from subscription sources in youtube analytics as a result we are enhancing our efforts to ensure that all subscriber counts are as accurate as possible on january 12th we will take the following steps to improve the quality and integrity of subscriber counts across the site remove inactive and closed accounts from total subscriber counts we will remove all such accounts from subscriber numbers on january 12th and continually update subscriber counts as subscribers become inactive or close their accounts improve techniques for preventing artificial inflation of subscriber counts recently weve seen a rise in creative agencies and vendors that claim to increase subscribers while complying with the youtube terms of service in most cases those claims are false the purchase or gaming of subscribers is a violation of our terms of service accordingly we are taking the following steps to prevent some users from artificially inflating their subscriber counts effective january 12th we will implement a more rigorous system that will prevent new subscriptions generated from these malicious sources from being added to subscriber counts beginning january 12th we will retroactively adjust subscriber counts to not include subscriptions generated by artificial sources on an ongoing basis please note while we are updating subscriber counts to remove such subscriptions from the totals we will not stop delivering videos to these subscribers even if they are artificially created accounts this means that even if we mistakenly remove a subscriber from a subscription account as invalid this will in no way affect your views by ensuring the quality of subscriber counts we hope that this metric will be a more valuable data point for creators creators who have not attempted to inflate their subscriber counts should only see a limited drop resulting from the removal of inactive and closed accounts while users who have benefitted from abuse will get a reality

stefan vraspir youtube partner support jan 06 2012 copy link copy link viewcounts are incredibly important to us here at youtube they serve as a way to recognize and surface great content and are one of the most scrutinized measures of popularity on youtube careers have been made because of viewcounts whether youre simply making a music video with friends or on the way back from the dentist views matter since views are so important its no surprise that there are companies whose entire business model is built on converting your cash into views we understand that promotion can be a highly effective way to grow your audience and we encourage you to promote your content on and off of youtube however we want to be clear that paying for views obtained through some of these companies could very well be a violation of our terms and one that we take very seriously so what do we mean exactly lets get specific what is a view we consider a view to be an action users want to do generally this means that they initiate the view for example they click on something they want to watch or decide not to skip something and they watch it pretty straightforward right a view should be a metric that reflects genuine user interest in other words a viewer has a choice and that choice determines whether or not we count something as a view it shouldnt be a gauge of how many people accidentally or unintentionally ended up watching your video what isnt ok services that attempt to gain views through automated means or that force or trick viewers into watching videos are not ok this could be through a variety of means including among other things deceptive layouts on third party websites that trick viewers into playing a video when they click unrelated elements on the page it might also be serving up embedded videos instead of intended content serving pop unders re directing and or a variety of other methods people use to try to inflate viewership at the end of the day anything that artificially increases the number of views either through the use of automatic systems or by serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers is against our terms videos and accounts that are found to be in violation of our terms may be closed down and removed from youtube buyer beware if you are going to contract someone to help promote your content it should be someone you absolutely trust as you may be putting the fate of your channel and your business on youtube in their hands if they are using methods that arent within our terms you will be the one to pay the price as it will be your videos and your channel that get taken down and dont just take their word for it ask the tough questions find out how they promote your content and do your due diligence ultimately you are responsible for knowing and abiding by our terms this means understanding the nature of the traffic on your channel and making sure you are in compliance with our terms ignorance of bad traffic or other actions taken

time and today we wanted to give you an update on the issues we re facing and where we are with resolving them we know we haven t met your expectations with this and here s how we re trying to fix that to start heres some background on how publishing works at youtube delivering your videos is a two phased systemwe process your video and then we deliver that video to your subscribers processing your videoour engineers are working hard to make video processing even faster more reliable and continue adding related features that make your life easier like resumable uploads we have more to do here in 2012 and will keep you updated with our progress delivering your videoover the last few weeks weve rolled out a subscriptions delivery system thats 20 times faster and more powerful able to deliver your videos to even more subscribers as your channels continue to grow its like upgrading from a unicycle to a racecar once our processing improvements are complete all the pieces should fall into place to make publishing a seamless and uneventful experience as it should be until that happens here are some tips to avoid common problems the 0 published problemwhat it means what this generally means is that the video is waiting on processing to complete before attempting to publish until the video has processed in all formats the status will stay at 0 what you can do dont delete your video and reupload just wait for your video to become available on all formats you would expect for a 1920x1080 video that means everything from 240p through 1080p and then the 0 published should go away very quickly once all formats have processed what were doing to fix this weve removed the confusing 0 published notification from the new video manager the icon will now say sending to subscribers feeds instead published video isnt appearing in feedswhat it means in almost all reports of this problems the issue isnt that videos arent appearing in feeds at all but its that the videos are not appearing at the top of the feed in chronological order this is because the position of videos in the chronology of the feeds reflects the uploaded time rather than published time this commonly happens when you upload a video as private or unlisted then make it public 48 hours later what you can do if you expect to keep your video private or unlisted for an extended period of time before marking it public consider using scheduled publishing to ensure it gets to the top of user feeds what were doing were looking at ways to make sure the order of videos reflects the published time rather than the original upload time as we are rolling out improvements well continue to provide updates through thecreator blogand please keep sharing your feedback in thepartner forum related

hijackers prey on the habits of the average internet user understanding common hijacking techniques and using better security practices will help you stay one step ahead of them the most common ways hijackers can get access to your password are password re use you sign up for an account on a third party site with your google username and password if that site is hacked and your sign in information is discovered the hijacker has easy access to your google account malware you use a computer with infected software that is designed to steal your passwords as you type keylogging or grab them from your browsers cache data phishing you respond to a website email or phone call that claims to come from a legitimate organization and asks for your username and password brute force you use a password thats easy to guess like your first or last name plus your birth date laura1968 or you provide an answer to a secret question thats common and therefore easy to guess like pizza for what is your favorite food as you can see hijackers have many tactics for stealing your password and its important to be aware of all of them take control of your account security across the web online accounts that share passwords are like a line of dominoes when one falls it doesnt take much for the others to fall too this is why you should choose unique passwords for important accounts like your google account your bank commerce sites and social networking sites choosing a unique password is not enough to secure your google account against every possible threat thats why weve created an easy to use checklist to help you secure your computer browser gmail and google account we encourage you to go through the entire checklist but want to highlight these tips never re use passwords for your important accounts like online banking email social networking and commerce enroll in 2 step verification 2 step verification adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to sign in with something you know your password and something you have a code sent to your phone to turn on 2 step verification follow the instructions on the 2 step verification setup page change your password periodically and be sure to do so for important accounts whenever you suspect one of them may have been at risk dont just change your password by a few letters or numbers aquarius5 to aquarius6 change the combination of letters and numbers to something unique each time never respond to messages non google websites or phone calls asking for your google username or password a legitimate organization will not ask you for this type of information report these messages to us so we can take action if you responded and can no longer access your account visit our account

easily manage all of their talent leads in one place helping them recruit the best talent more quickly the announcement was made onstage by linkedin ceo jeff weiner in front of more than 1 800 recruiting professionals at the companys talent connect customer event in las vegas nevada with the rise of social media recruiters are dealing with an increase in online networks as sources of talent who may not be actively seeking a new job this is in addition to more traditional sources such as personal referrals conferences job boards and company career sites this shift toward recruiting passive talent gives recruiters access to a much larger pool of potential candidates with the right skills and experience than if they relied on active candidates alone talent pipeline will allow recruiters to keep track of all of these potential candidates in one place even before they enter the formal application process speaking on the announcement linkedin ceo jeff weiner commented recruiters are actively looking for more talent from more sources and managing all their talent leads across multiple tools with linkedin talent pipeline were extending our recruiter platform and continuing our focus to connect talent with opportunity on a massive scale by providing a single place to manage and update these leads wherever they are found because most passive candidates have not formally applied for a job they are not tracked in a companys applicant tracking system ats as a result many recruiters are simply tracking leads in their own spreadsheets a tool designed for crunching numbers not tracking nurturing and collaborating on recruitment james holincheck managing vice president of human capital management at gartner commented one of the most frequent things we hear from enterprises today is a desire to better manage the increasing number of talent sources recruiters know that passive candidates are an important source of talent and want better tools to capture this opportunity today companies that try to create a separate database for leads spend significant time and effort to implement a new system and process only to find they havent solved the problem of stale information the moment someone changes a title job or location the original lead or resume is out of date and the database becomes less valuable linkedin talent pipeline solves this problem all of their talent leads at their fingertips on the linkedin recruiter platform recruiters can import leads and resumes found from other sources into recruiter these records can be searched tagged with additional information and shared across the team just like any profile sourced on linkedin with new tools for adding a leads source and status recruiters will be able to report on and improve the efficiency of their pipeline activities stale leads are transformed into up to date records with deeper insights by being connected to linkedin when new leads are imported they are connected to their linkedin profile which members keep updating even when they arent looking for a job recruiters are better positioned to evaluate and build relationships with leads based on the insights provided by the linkedin profile including shared connections activity updates recommendations and shared groups because it is linkedin it is an easy extension of the sourcing that recruiting teams already do on the professional network today more than 75 of the fortune 100 and another 6 000 companies use linkedin hiring solutions as a resource for finding contacting evaluating and staying

the small stuff like their thoughts on an article to the most important events of their lives like the photos of their wedding or the birth of their child the evolution of your profile back in the early days of facebook your profile was pretty basic just your name a photo where you went to schoolstuff youd cover in the first five minutes you met someone over time your profile evolved to better reflect how you actually communicate with your friends now you can can share photos of what you did last weekend and updates about how you feel today but since the focus is on the most recent things you posted more important stuff slips off the page the photos of your graduation get replaced by updates about what you had for breakfast say youre catching up with an old friend would you rather find out that they had eggs this morning or hear about their new dream job the way your profile works today 99 of the stories you share vanish the only way to find the posts that matter is to click older posts at the bottom of the page again and again imagine if there was an easy way to rediscover the things you shared and collect all your best moments in a single place introducing timeline a new kind of profile with timeline now you have a home for all the great stories youve already shared they dont just vanish as you add new stuff timeline is wider than your old profile and its a lot more visual the first thing youll notice is the giant photo right at the top this is your cover and its completely up to you which of your photos you put here as you scroll down past your cover youll see your posts photos and life events as they happened in time you choose whats featured on your timeline you can star your favorites to double their size or hide things altogether filling in the blanks if important parts of your story arent included on your timeline you can go back to when they happened and add them or go to your private activity log this is where youll find everything you shared since you joined facebook click on any post to feature it on your timeline so your friends can see it too add apps to your timeline introducing a new kind of social app that lets you show the things you like to do on your timeline the music you listen to the recipes you try the runs you take and more these apps also help you discover what your friends are up to you can even join in if you want play the song theyre listening to or watch the same tv show you can start adding some of these new apps today but timeline wont be available for a few weeks when you get your timeline you can choose to publish it immediately or take a few days to review whats there and add anything thats missing now you and your friends will finally be able to tell all the different parts of your story from the

their numbers for your channel s and why there may be instances where the comscore data does not match what you see in your youtube account weve invited comscores product manager dan piech to walk you through their methodology if you have further questions about how things are calculated in the comscore reports visit www comscore com youtube or ask your partner manager take it away dan comscore has invested significant time and resources toward ensuring that the data captured processed and presented is of the highest quality retaining the industry leading data integrity and privacy standards comscore is proud to have helped establish comscores video metrix data for youtube partners comes from two primary sources 1 a panel of roughly 1 million individuals in the u s and 2 million worldwide these individuals have given comscore permission to measure their internet activity including video viewing from this source comscore is able to understand video viewers demographics engagement rates viewing patterns and a plethora of additional attitudinal and behavioral characteristics 2 census level video impression tags relayed through youtubes server infrastructure anytime anyone views a video that belongs to a youtube partner who has enabled comscore measurement we count as an impression tag no personally identifiable information about the viewers is contained within these tags they are merely a notification to comscore that a video has been viewed this data is used to calibrate comscores panel insights to a 100 accurate census based measure of views ensuring the most accurate data possible this process is known as unification and comscore is an industry leader in pioneering this method of joining both panel and census based market research measurements there may be times when comscores data for video views differs from what you see in your youtube account this could happen because comscores data 1 is only representative of computer based viewing at home and work locations whereas youtube s data is for all viewing regardless of platform 2 is currently only presented for one country at a time whereas youtubes data represents all worldwide viewing 3 uses different mechanisms than youtube to filter out non human traffic spider bot views and fraud attempts 4 does not include views of partners claimed ugc content whereas youtubes data may include these

well also be working with hfa to invite other publishers to sign up even if theyre not affiliated with hfa our content id system allows us to identify the works of these songwriters whether the compositions appear in an original sound recording or in a cover version using information provided to us by the publishers this means that more songwriters will be able to share in more of the revenue that the youtube communitys creativity yields its simple for publishers to opt in to this licensing opportunity and advances in our technology help publishers to find even more performances of their songs providing the opportunity for more revenue content id is used today by 2000 partners including every major us music publisher record label network broadcaster and movie studio while this deal is only with the publishers it will also benefit recording artists and record labels its been youtubes policy to run ads alongside videos with commercial music only when the copyright holders for

not always an easy task power adapters for cellphones and computers dont always fit into local power outlets meaning you have to pack converters think of video on the web in a similar way currently there are countless devices used to record videos and hundreds of different video file formats even more certain web browsers that you use to view video online only accept certain codecs or programs used to encode transmit and playback video files and others require plug ins converters to integrate the video file with the browser despite these complexities one of our key aims is to deliver great

new videos uploaded to youtube are now transcoded into webm webm is an open media file format for video and audio on the web its openness allows anyone to improve the format and its integrations resulting in a better experience for you in the long term as we work to transcode more videos into webm we hope to reduce the technical incompatibilities that prevent you from accessing video while improving the overall online video landscape transcoding all new video uploads into webm is an important first step and were also working to transcode our entire video catalog to webm given the massive size of our catalog nearly 6 years of video is uploaded to youtube every day this is quite the undertaking so far weve already transcoded videos that make up 99 of views on the site or nearly 30 of all videos into webm were focusing first on the most viewed videos on the site and weve made great progress here through our cloud based video processing infrastructure that maximizes the efficiency of processing and transcoding without stopping it works like this at busy upload times our processing power is dedicated to new uploads and at less busy times our cloud will automatically switch some of our processing to encode older videos into webm as we continue to transcode the remaining inventory well keep you posted on our progress in keeping with our goal of making videos universally accessible we will continue to support h 264 as an important codec for video on youtube we are also committed to continuing to develop our html5 video player that we announced last year and if youd like to join the opt in trial you can do so here the world of online video is incredibly complex and dynamic yet our goal is to ensure that nothing stands between you and the great content

imagine instead of that sleek new mobile phone you bought last year you were instead carrying around one of those big brick phones from the 90s it might still make calls but it would be slow and bulky and unable to do 90 of what current smart phones do your old youtube account is a lot like that cell phone it still works but its not as fast secure and efficient as the google account were asking you to link to while we understand that change isnt always welcome were confident that this transition will result in a better experience for you on youtube not only does connecting your youtube account to a google account improve your account security it will also give you better video recommendations and quick access to the very latest updates and features which our engineers are releasing on the

product built to provide our users with simple editing tools although it didnt have all the features available on paid desktop editing software the idea was that the vast majority of peoples video editing needs are pretty basic and straight forward and we could provide these features with a free editor available on the web since launch hundreds of thousands of videos have been published using the youtube video editor and weve regularly pushed out new feature enhancements to the product including video transitions crossfade wipe slide the ability to save projects across sessionsincreased clips allowed in the editor from 6 to 17video rotation from portrait to landscape and vice versa great for videos shot on mobile shape transitions heart star diamond and jack o lantern for halloween audio mixing audioswap track mixed with original audio effects brightness contrast black white a new user interface and project menu for multiple saved projectswhile many of these are familiar features also available on desktop software today were excited to unveil two new features that the team has been working on over the last couple of months that take unique advantage of the cloud stabilizer ever shoot a shaky video thats so jittery its actually hard to watch professional cinematographers use stabilization equipment such as tripods or camera dollies to keep their shots smooth and steady our team mimicked these cinematographic principles by automatically determining the best camera path for you through a unified optimization technique in plain english you can smooth some of those unsteady videos with the click of a button we also wanted you to be able to preview these results in real time before publishing the finished product to the web we can do this by harnessing the power of the cloud by splitting the computation required for stabilizing the video into chunks and distributed them across different servers this allows us to use the power of many machines in parallel computing and streaming the stabilized results quickly into the preview you can check out the paper were publishing entitled auto directed video stabilization with robust l1 optimal camera paths want to see stabilizer in action you can test it out for yourself or check out these two videos the first is without stabilizer and now with the stabilizer 3d when we first launched our 3d product one of the hardest parts turned out to be actually building our makeshift 3d camera to film our introductory 3d video two flip cameras mounted to a flat metal bar 10 inches apart and using 8 worth of bolts and brackets we bought at the hardware store although the side by side compositing needed for 3d uploads isnt complex its unavailable in free editing tools this was frustrating because although users could film using a pair of cameras the 3d feature was still out of reach and synchronising the two cameras is an added challenge if you ve used a pair of cameras to capture stereographic video but need the two streams to be synchronized and laid out in a way compatible with youtube s 3d feature this new tool will do the work for you feel free to try it out one of the great things about youtube is being able to launch products quickly with a small team of engineers that impact hundreds of millions of users from around the world in this case we had seven engineers and one designer whove contributed to this product we look forward to announcing more editor enhancements down the road let us know what you think and paste links of your stabilized or 3d ified videos

copy link few things can be more frustrating than waiting for what feels like years for that amazing video you just shot to finish uploading to the site so you can publish it and share it with your friends whether its the speed a video plays back or the speed a video uploads at youtube speed matters why do we care so much about speed because we know that speed can mean the difference between you having a good experience or you leaving youtube in search of a better faster one today as we look at 2011 wed like to review our progress in improving the processing and publishing speed for videos by processing and publishing we mean what happens behind the scenes between the moment you press the youtube upload button to the moment that video appears on the site for your friends to see here is the challenge 35 hours of video are uploaded to youtube every minute over time the average file size is going up the average resolution is going up as people switch to hd cameras and the average duration of the videos is going up moreover an increase in resolution results in a quadratic increase in the number of pixels to be processed a 1080p hd video has 2m pixels compared to 300k pixels in a 480p dvd quality video in the last few years the youtube infrastructure team has tackled this challenge in a variety of different ways we highlight two of them the first is to overlap uploads and video processing without waiting for the upload to finish this results in a base quality version of your video going live very quickly after the upload completes making the link to your video active and shareable the second technique which weve internally codenamed hydra after greek mythologys nine headed monster tackles this problem by leveraging googles massive cloud computing capabilities we split a single video into small chunks and process each chunk simultaneously on different machines hydra then reassembles all the processed chunks so that you see a seamless video processed and published in a fraction of the time it would have taken to do it previously as you can see from the above chart were making big strides when it comes to our battle to get videos processed and live faster here are some additional stats we now process videos seven times faster than we did in 2008 weve gotten four times faster in the last six months60 of all youtube videos go live in under a minute as compared to none last year we know that there remains a lot for us to do when it comes to improving processing time and reliability and we certainly dont think we have come close to solving the problem entirely

and other big text on top of your video just like you would with professional video editing tools new font size options you can now select from a combined set of six font sizes new color options annotations are now available in 16 background colors and 14 font colors annotations can be a very powerful creative tool and make videos that are engaging informative and interactive however its

happy birthday automatic captions celebrate with more videos and higher quality by ken harrenstien caption jedi nov 19 2010 copy link copy link today marks exactly one year since we launched automatic captions we started with just a few partner channels in november 2009 and soon after turned on auto captions for everyone as we explained back then we like to launch early and iterate and this year weve been making steady progress to expand the quantity and quality of captioned video online its been truly gratifying to see how far weve come heres the quick summary people have watched video with automatic captions more than 23 million times and have automatically translated captions more than 7 6 million times the number of manually created caption tracks has more than tripled thanks largely to automatic caption timing technology just recently weve reduced the error rate in our speech recognition algorithms by 20 back in november we talked about how online video presents a tremendous challenge of scale before automatic captions there were around 200 000 videos on youtube with captions it sounds like a lot but at youtube more than 35 hours of video is uploaded every minute we want all videos to be accessible to everyone whether or not they can hear or understand the language since march people have been able to get captions for almost any video that has clearly spoken english less than a year later people have watched video with automatic captions more than 23 million times clearly theres a lot of demand for captioned content and people have been really making use of our technology theyre also using the technology to access content in their own languages since captions can be automatically translated to more than fifty languages weve seen more than 7 6 million caption translations auto captions arent perfect so weve also been pursuing a number of initiatives to help people manually create captions at our event a year ago we introduced automatic caption timing a feature that will take an ordinary text file and turn it into captions with time codes since then weve added these features to the youtube data api to make it easier for people to write scripts and apps that can upload large numbers of captions at once more recently we started the youtube ready qualification program to help video owners find professional caption vendors familiar with youtube thanks to these efforts weve seen the number of manually created caption tracks available on youtube more than triple with more than 500 000 available today when it comes to captions we care not just about quantity but also quality here again we have good news just like a real one year old youtube has been learning many new words for example we now recognize the word smartphone turn on speech recognition to see in the past few weeks weve rolled out a significant improvements to our speech recognition technology to improve the accuracy of automatic captions youtube s new speech recognition model reduces the overall word error rate by about 20 although the improvements vary from video to video a video that had identified 50 of the words correctly before will now recognize about 60 of the words and a video that was at 75 before will now correctly identify about 80 of the words we continue to make improvements and there is much more on the way on a personal note it s been amazing to see the feedback videos blog posts thanks and bug reports sent in over the past year even though we can t possibly respond to them all we love to see them and they shape our efforts on this project weve taken this feedback to make a number of subtle improvements to the service such as adding an always show automatic captions setting adding an interactive transcript button so you can see all the captions and skip through the video and making the redbutton easier to find what s next well continue to work on accuracy and we also want to make sure captions are available on youtube everywhere on your internet tv your computer and your mobile phone we have a few other things coming but i don t want to spoil the surprise you ll have to stay tuned and i hope you ll turn the captions on when you

they have previously clicked on by giving them a different color the standard generally being that links are in blue and visited links are in purple many sites including youtube opt to make all links blue regardless of visited state to give a more consistent look to the site and better reflect its dynamic nature however having a visited state is specifically useful when exhaustively exploring search results or related videos and so we are launching a new style for thumbnails and links to videos in related and search results the thumbnail for visited videos is slightly grayed and the link

blog we are sorry we haven t kept in touch with you through this blog but if there was ever a time to break the radio silence now is the time the first item we would like to address is the stability

talking about the homepage has been delivering nearly 45 million impressions per day and 18 million unique visitors a day in the u s that s the equivalent to the ratings of several top rated prime

be part of the action a little known fact is that a few days each quarter we open up the youtube homepage to promoted video advertisers these companies end up getting a bit of extra exposure from their campaigns there are a couple of ways to make sure your ads show up on the homepage should the opportunity arise first log into your adwords account and under campaign settings consider the

partners and advertisers on youtube or search under the label bizblog there is an audience for every kind of video on youtube from beauty videos to ultimate fighting because of this diversity it s important that we provide advertisers with tools that give them control of where their ads are shown and to whom innovations like the video targeting tool and re marketing are only two of the many ways we ve given advertisers greater control of their youtube presence and helped them get in front of the exact audience they want to reach while advertisers have great targeting options for their ads like overlays and in stream ads sometimes they want similar controls when it comes to their videos themselves for example gaming companies or movie studios may wish to upload trailers to youtube that highlight content rated for audiences above a certain age or alcoholic beverage companies want to ensure that the videos they upload as part of their campaigns are only made available to registered users above the legal drinking age for these reasons we re pleased to offer a new feature that allows select advertisers to voluntarily age restrict watch pages for their videos this is a long requested feature by many advertisers interested in promoting their products but who want to be sure that they comply with their own industry guidelines regulations advertisers have always been able to age restrict their channels generally but to date only users could flag specific videos that they thought should be age restricted under our community guidelines now advertisers can do so proactively and can choose different ages depending on their needs several advertisers have already tested this new feature including alcoholic beverage companies through age restricting companies like pacifico have uploaded their videos to youtube with confidence that they will only be viewed by the right target demographic we re constantly looking to build tools and features that make youtube a safer place for users partners and advertisers we hope that voluntary age restricting will increase advertiser flexibility and control while staying true to our responsibilities as a trusted video

in 2006 new youtube signups were given the choice between two different account systems to power their youtube experience the original youtube account system built in 2005 or the google account system in may 2009 we started requiring all new youtube usernames to be powered by google accounts now were gradually asking all remaining pre may 2009 users still using the older youtube account system to connect a google account to their youtube username for now its an optional step but eventually itll be required in order to continue using your youtube username before we go any further we should clarify three important facts youtube usernames themselves arent going anywhere no matter when you signed up for youtube or if youre currently associated with a google account youll still be lifeoftheparty29 aka your username on youtube a google account is not necessarily a gmail account you can create a google account with any email address through many different google products just like you can create a twitter or facebook account with any email address of course you can choose to use gmail as the email address for your google account connecting your existing youtube username to an existing google account doesnt start sharing your youtube activity to your buzz followers its only an account connection behind the scenes and its still up to you to decide whether or not to bring youtube into the rest of your google life so whats the point of asking people to connect a google account to their older youtube account here are the main reasons improved account security the google account system is robust and will help reduce spam across the site users will get a slew of security and safety features that google has spent the past decade developing a single account system this may not mean much to anyone outside of the youtube engineering team but behind the scenes its extremely complicated to support two different account systems having all users on the same account system not only simplifies matters but more important it makes it much easier to use google technologies to keep the site running smoothly over two billion views a day and counting as well as introduce new functionality if you have an older youtube account and youd like to link to a new or existing google account today just visit this page and choose to link to an existing google account or a brand new

shoot in 4k arent cheap and projectors that show videos in 4k are typically the size of a small refrigerator and as we mentioned watching these videos on youtube will require super fast broadband we

Privacy","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Facebook Redesigns Privacy","text":"simplifies choices and offers more powerful controls palo alto calif may 26 facebook today responded to user comments and concerns about privacy by announcing it will introduce simpler and more powerful controls for sharing personal information new settings will give the more than 400 million people who use facebook the power to control exactly who can see the information and content they share all with just a few simple clicks in addition new settings will be added to make it easier to turn off third party applications or websites facebook founder and ceo mark zuckerberg officially announced the changes in a blog post today at blog facebook com when we started facebook we built it around a few simple ideas said zuckerberg when people have control over what they share they want to share more when people share more the world becomes more open and connected over the past few weeks the number one thing weve heard is that many users want a simpler way to control their information today were starting to roll out changes that will make our controls simpler and easier the companys new privacy controls reflect wide ranging consultation with the office of senator charles schumer d ny and a number of online privacy and consumer advocacy groups these include the center for democracy and technology consumer action future of privacy forum electronic frontier foundation progress and freedom foundation netchoice cato institute truste technology policy institute and information technology and innovation foundation the consultations have proven extremely helpful in both clarifying and communicating facebooks privacy principles and have greatly contributed to the design and implementation of the new privacy controls these updated controls will start rolling out today and will be live for all facebook users in the coming weeks zuckerberg first announced facebooks intention to make these changes in a washington post op ed that detailed principles by which facebook operates people have control over how their information is shared facebook does not share personal information with people or services users dont want facebook does not give advertisers access to peoples personal information facebook does not sell any of peoples information to anyone facebook will always be a free service for everyone todays announcement focuses on the first two of these principles making control simple one control for content a new simple control makes it easy to share on facebook with friends friends of friends or everyoneall with just one click the corresponding settings are immediately applied and displayed in an easy to understand grid at the same time facebook has maintained its more granular settings for those who want to customize their level of sharing these settings now all appear on a single page for easier access retroactive control people who choose the more restrictive friends only or friends of friends options with the simple control will have the corresponding setting for all the content they posted previously for sharing thus a person can make all the content theyve ever shared on facebook more private with just a couple of clicks future products facebook commits to carry over peoples privacy choices for new products that facilitate sharing thus if someone chooses friends only for sharing on facebook new products that have privacy settings will be automatically set to friends only this means facebook users dont have to worry about new settings in the future prioritizing simplicity granularity of control has always been a primary objective in facebooks privacy design starting with the changes announced today the company will also prioritize ease of use in its privacy design fewer privacy changes facebooks goal is to make privacy related changes with less frequency and to work within the framework announced today as it continues to innovate new features and products less publicly available information significantly less public information facebook has drastically reduced the amount of information that is available to everyone this information is now limited to name profile picture should a user choose to have one gender though this can be hidden on the profile and networks should the user join any privacy controls for pages connections to pages which were previously available to everyone will have privacy settings that work for both ends of the connection people can prevent others from seeing pages on their profile and from seeing them in the people who like this boxes on the pages themselves applications will also need to ask for explicit permission in order to access any of your pages that are not visible to everyone easier opt outs full control over how applications and websites on facebook platform access information in response to requests facebook has added a simple way for people to completely turn off platform applications and websites so that your information is not shared with applications even information available to everyone easier opt out of instant personalization pilot program facebook has also made it easier for people to turn off the instant personalization program which prevents those and any future applications in the program from accessing their information granular data permissions for applications and websites facebook also highlighted the new controls users have over information shared with applications and websites on facebook platform with the new data permissions model applications must obtain specific approval before gaining access to any personal information that a user has not made available to everyone what people are saying facebooks users have spoken and made it clear that they want control of their information despite all rumors to the contrary privacy is not dead it is on its way to a comeback in the form of simplified controls and better policies said leslie harris president center for democracy and technology while more work still needs to be done these changes are the building blocks to giving people what they want and deserve people care about privacy now more than ever we are pleased that facebook has pledged to improve user control and choice and we look forward to working together to help them follow through on this commitment said michelle de mooy senior associate at consumer action we believe the company must work with a broad coalition of consumer and privacy advocates regulators and legislators in order to raise the bar and lead the industry toward empowering and protecting consumers online we also hope that this step forward from facebook will send a message to industry that strong privacy standards arent just good policy theyre good business the message that all companies should be taking away from this is that managing digital identity is critically important to internet users of all ages and backgrounds facebook is taking steps that are essential for user trust by providing users with additional control over the personal data they share as sites services and devices grow increasingly complex the challenge for facebook and for others going forward is to continue to seek innovations that ensure that privacy tools can be intuitive for users said jules polonetsky director future of privacy forum facebooks announcement should remind us all that online services actively compete in the market of public opinion based on their commitment to empowering users to make their own choices about privacy said berin szoka senior fellow and director of the center for internet freedom at progress and freedom foundation facebook has affirmed that commitment by responding to user demands to allow users to restrict visibility of their friends and their likes and to opt out completely from sharing of information with third party applications and external websites just as important is the improved user interface which maximizes both granularity of user control and ease of usetwo things that are always in tension achieving both complexity and simplicity requires ongoing iterative process of innovation these new features give consumers more choice and more control over their informationa win for both facebook and its users said daniel castro senior analyst for the information technology and innovation foundation facebooks latest changes show that companies are responding appropriately to their customers concerns about privacy in this case market and customer feedback are more effective tools for meeting consumer needs than heavy handed privacy regulations that would only impede innovation providing people with true privacy choices that are both simple and transparent is no easy task facebooks changes to make its privacy settings more accessible as well as to provide broader opt out choices reflect both the companys deep commitment to control and its ability to quickly innovate and incorporate feedback said fran maier president of truste we will continue to work closely with facebook to ensure that it lives up to the commitments it has made to its users announcement fact sheet the changes completely redesigned the privacy settings page to be much more simple created one control for content a new simple control makes it easy to share on facebook with friends friends of friends or everyoneall with just one click the corresponding settings are immediately applied and displayed in an easy to understand grid at the same time facebook has maintained its more granular settings for those who want to customize their level of sharing these settings now all appear on a single page for easier access significantly reduced the amount of information that is always visible to everyone friends and pages your connections can now be restricted to anyone you want to help people recognize you your name profile picture networks and gender are always open to everyone though half of these you dont need to add given you more control over how applications and websites access your information now you can completely turn off facebook platform applications and websites which means that your information will not be shared with applications we also made it very simple to turn off instant personalization you can ensure that your information is not shared with current or future instant personalization applications by un checking the box to enable instant personalization get a better understanding of how you like to share on facebook the new presets help us understand the overall privacy level youre comfortable with for the things you share as we roll out new products we want to apply the right setting for you at the outseteliminating the need for you to check your setting each time a new feature is introduced were committed to carrying over your presets for new products that facilitate sharing so if you choose the friends only preset for sharing on facebook new products that have privacy settings will be automatically set to friends only as well not changing anything about our advertising programs we never sell any of your personal information to anyone theres a rumor that the more openly you share your information the more money we make but its just wrong advertisers may target ads to people according to certain demographics but they receive only anonymous data reports we dont share your personal information with our advertisers data points reduced the number of settings required to make all information private from nearly 50 to less than 15 introduced presets that cover 18 individual settings for sharing with one single controltwo clicks to control what had been more than 100 different options consolidated 10 settings on 3 separate pages into 7 settings on one page reduced the number of separate pages in privacy center from 13 to 8 faq q how are users being informed of these changes as we roll this out we will be posting a message to all users on the homepage pointing them to information that explains the changes in addition we have and will continue to devote significant resources to educating people about the control they have on facebook before rolling out these changes we will update our robust privacy education materials including a new privacy guide http www facebook com privacy explanation php instructional videos posted to our blog and facebook page and numerous faqs in our help center finally we are committed to working with non profit organizations to raise awareness among their constituents q were users involved in this redesign yes we incorporated four rounds of iterative user testing into the redesign process in each of these tests we worked with a variety of users from those that classified themselves as very open to those that classified themselves as very closed in each round of testing users were given a variety of tasks to measure both their understanding of the features as well as their experience using the privacy controls we then continuously modified the explanatory language the placement and the visual presentation of the controls based on the users experiences q where can people provide feedback on these changes we hope these changes demonstrate the tremendous respect we have for the hundreds of millions of people who use facebook every day and our commitment to ensuring that each of these people continues to feel comfortable sharing and connecting today as always we encourage our users to submit their thoughts and feedback http www facebook com privacyfeedback q how soon until everyone gets the new privacy settings we are working hard to make the simpler privacy controls available to everyone as soon as possible however as is our standard practice with most products we launch we will begin with a slow roll out and will gradually increase the number of people who with new controls this process started today and will be complete

weeks"},{"id":"d461825b-4f41-4f67-8ffe-b62f3073202f","platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-launches-in-south-africa","date":"2010-05-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products

now after a few more additions based on your latest feedback we are rolling it out to 100 of youtube users here s what s new about the page overall look and functionality it s cleaner simpler and easier to use information about a video is now grouped together in one place and there s a consistent way to get more detail when you need it this way unless something s truly useful to you it doesn t clutter up your page we ve cleaned up the actions bar you ll see a streamlined presentation for sharing flagging and embedding controls discovery the right hand side of the page is devoted to the next video to watch we re smarter about suggesting the next videos to watch based on how you found the video you re watching in the first place the channel name and subscribe button are now both on top of the video we found that you prefer having a quick peek at more videos uploaders have created before deciding whether to subscribe to their channels playlists there s a new playlist interface with the next video in the list appearing consistently in the top right you can easily expand that list or skip ahead using a new next button in the player controls saving to playlists is easier and we ve made

every minute we support 1080p and hd uploads are rising quickly but thats also meant increasing bandwidth costs cutting into our bottom line and so in our drive to keep expenses under control weve decided that april 1 is the perfect day to take the important step of offering a new way to experience youtube text only mode or textp textp is the result of months of intense transcoding efforts by our engineers who toiled for weeks to ensure that a large chunk of videos on the platform could be reduced to their most basic elements by replacing the images in the video with a series of letters and numbers the videos are far less taxing on our system and have the added benefit of promoting literacy to give it a whirl make sure you have the latest flash player 10 0 and click here or you can

as 50 of views in the first 48 hours kicking off a great cycle we offer a few size choices when you grab a video s embed code the default size used to be on the smaller side smaller than the size displayed on youtube com but as of today we re defaulting to a larger size one that s the same size of a video on youtube com either 480x385 if 4 3 video or 640x385 for 16 9 content these new defaults were selected because they will give the majority of people the best possible viewing experience and because they better match our current video encoding sizes when you click on the embed code the

large size at least 1280x745 in order to accommodate the large size of the video if you play hd video in a small player the user s computer will have to scale down the video to fit within the player

people in the u s experience some kind of hearing impairment and recent studies have predicted that over 700 million people worldwide will suffer from hearing impairment by 2015 to address a clear need the broadcast industry began running captions on regular video programming in the early 1970s today closed captions on video are more prevalent than ever but generating captions today can be a time consuming and complicated process making video easily accessible is something we re working hard to address at youtube one of the first steps we took was the development of a caption feature in 2008 in november of last year we released auto captioning for a small select group of partners auto captioning combines some of the speech to text algorithms found in google s voice search to automatically generate video captions when requested by a viewer the video owner can also download the auto generated captions improve them and upload the new version viewers can even choose an option to translate those captions into any one of 50 different languages all in just a couple of clicks today we are opening up auto captions to all youtube users there will even be a request processing button for un captioned videos that any video owner can click on if they want to speed up the availability of auto captions it will take some time to process all the available video so here are some things to keep in mind while we plan to broaden the feature to include more languages in the months to come currently auto captioning is only for videos where english is spoken just like any speech recognition application auto captions require a clearly spoken audio track videos with background noise or a muffled voice can t be auto captioned president obama s speech on the recent chilean earthquake is a good example of the kind of audio that works for auto captions auto captions aren t perfect and just like any other transcription the owner of the video needs to check to make sure they re accurate in other cases the audio file may not be good enough to generate auto captions but please be patient our speech recognition technology gets better every day auto captions should be available to everyone who s interested in using them we re also working to provide auto captions for all past user uploads that fit the above mentioned requirements if you re having trouble enabling them for your video please visit our help center this article is for uploaders and this article is for viewers for content owners the power of auto captioning is significant with just a few quick clicks your videos can be accessed by a whole new global audience and captions can make is easier for users to discover content on youtube twenty hours of video is uploaded to youtube every minute

engineer and ipv6 samurai feb 05 2010 copy link copy link the first telephone numbers in the latter part of the 19th century were short and simple made up of no more than a few digits calls would be routed through operators and these operators would then manually patch these calls into the lines of their intended recipients as more and more people got telephones the length of telephone numbers grew from three to four to seven and then eventually to 10 digits and beyond today cities like manhattan have been forced to have multiple area codes 917 646 212 347 etc and if you want to dial outside of your country add on a few more numbers so what does this history lesson have to do with youtube ip the internet protocol is the protocol used to communicate data across the internet in the same way telephones connected conversations over a century ago each connection has an ip address that works like a telephone number just like telephone numbers these ip addresses need to grow to accommodate all the new people coming online the problem is that ipv4 the current version of the internet protocol uses a 32 bit address and those addresses are running out of space fast in 2000 internet users had consumed 50 of ipv4 address space today ipv4 has less than 10 of addresses available when address space runs out users will have to share addresses because there won t be enough to go around but there is hope ipv6 has a vastly larger address space 128 bit and allows everyone to have an incredibly large number 2 64or more of personalized ip addresses for all their devices think of it as having a whole telephone exchange in your home not having to share ip addresses is good for users because it means better more relevant information can be delivered to them whenever they want it it s a win for openness and new applications because any device can connect directly to any other device on the internet it s even a win for security because it s harder for hackers to find your computer and attack it but up until now ipv6 still hasn t gotten as much traction as ipv4 and content creators and users have yet to adopt it on a wide scale since the very first announcement of ipv6

recently we published a blog post on our pre spring cleaning effort and your number one request was that youtube do more with html5 today we re introducing an experimental version of an html5 supported player html5 is a new web standard that is gaining popularity rapidly and adds many new features to your web experience most notably for youtube users html5 includes support for video and audio playback this means that users with an html5 compatible browser and support for the proper audio and video codecs can watch a video without needing to download a browser plugin our support for html5 is an early experiment and there are some limitations html5 on youtube doesn t support videos with ads captions or annotations and it requires a browser that supports both the video tag and h 264 encoded video currently that means chrome safari and chromeframe on internet explorer we will be expanding the capabilities of the player in the future so get ready for new and improved versions in the months to come to try it out go to the html5 page via testtube or visit this page and join the experiment this will enable html5 video for your browser provided that it s one of the browsers mentioned above and fits in with the parameters we already referenced if you ve opted in to other experiments you may not get the html5 player you can also enable feather watch visit http www youtube com feather beta along with html5 video for an even simpler faster youtube experience we are very excited about html5 as an open standard and want to be part of moving html5 forward on the web related

facebook in the area that says where do i share my activities if you ve already hooked this up you may need to disconnect and reconnect accounts to enable you can choose to disable autoshare right afterwards if you don t want your youtube actions to be syndicated out to facebook but if you do want your youtube related facebook activity to be syndicated back to youtube the key is that you just stay connected to facebook alternatively you can search for your friends using the friend finding module on the homepage and that will also connect you to facebook once hooked up it might take a little while for videos to start appearing on your homepage during this experimental phase we see the youtube homepage as only the start of your video journey it s where you should be able to get a snapshot of the youtube zeitgeist at any moment that is those videos that are most relevant to you and to the times sometimes those videos are served up by algorithms that offer recommendations based on your viewing history or the channels you re subscribed to by adding the videos your friends are embedding on facebook into the mix we re hoping to close a loop with regards to how videos are shared

ll notice a the action links are a bit smaller and more condensed b we ve eliminated the tabs for comments statistics data and instead made all of these available in expandable sections which you can collapse uncollapse using the little arrow making it easy to expose or hide information in a consistent way as a side note we ve begun work on a broader watch page redesign to incorporate all the

commons licenses permit people to reuse downloaded content under certain conditions we re also testing an option that gives video owners the ability to permit downloading of their videos from youtube partners could choose to offer their video downloads for free or for a small fee paid through google checkout partners can set prices and decide which license they want to attach to the downloaded

sharing of information we are testing free downloads of youtube videos from stanford duke uc berkeley ucla and uctv broadcasting programs from throughout the uc system youtube users who are traveling or teachers who want to show these videos in classrooms with limited or no connectivity should find this particularly useful a small number of other youtube partners including khanacademy

broadcast a bulletin directly to your channel visitors in your recent activity box this not only provides a fun place to shout out personal updates and news but also provides an additional way to communicate and engage with your channel s fans we hope you like these changes and are always eager to hear your feedback so please feel free to share your thoughts with us update as some people have

rolling out today in order to highlight the most recent and relevant information that users value give users even more control and ownership over their profiles and simplify the user experience said facebook founder and ceo mark zuckerberg facebooks new design makes it a lot easier for users to share information and we encourage them to check it out the company has been developing the new design since early this year over the past six months more than 100 000 facebook users offered constructive suggestions on the layout and features many of which were included in the final version the power of feeds facebook uses feeds to deliver people news and information in a social context the evolution of the site design focuses on integrating powerful feed technology and the wall a forum for users and their friends to post comments photos videos and more including content from third party applications the wall now surfaces more current and pertinent information or stories about a user and their friends on facebook new types of stories users have complete control over the stories published on their profile they also have the ability to adjust the size and prominence of stories and can choose between having one line stories short or full stories one line stories are one sentence long while short stories include thumbnail photos or content and full stories display large noticeable images publish more content located on the wall tab the publisher feature enables users to create more content than ever and in a centralized place from the publisher a user can add photos upload video or write notes rather than navigating to each individual application similarly users can add content to their friends profiles through the publisher on their profiles easier site navigation with tabs the top menu is similar to the old design and allows users to access their profile friends and inbox the left hand applications menu has been moved to the applications link on the top of the menu screen

change frequently the photos tab shows photos of the user as well as their albums the boxes tab features all of a users existing application boxes users are also able to add individual tabs for their

integrated into facebook in order to make using applications simpler and more seamless users will have the option to interact with an application before adding it grant it access to their information and decide where they want it placed if at all on their profiles privacy controls on facebook users choose what information they put in their profile including contact and personal information pictures interests and groups they join and they control the users with whom they share that information through the privacy settings on the privacy page of their profile the new design does not change any of the privacy settings previously selected by the user the new facebook design will be made available to users at http www new facebook com in the coming weeks all facebook users will

campaigns with new ways to evaluate information and formulate campaign strategy our new analytics tool youtube insight allows any video uploader to view detailed statistics about the videos that they upload to the site including aggregated information about the age sex and geographical location of their viewership over time you can also see how people found your video whether by searching on youtube or google browsing related videos or visiting blogs and other websites for campaigns with politician channels on the site this means improving their ability to understand and engage with the millions of voters that make youtube the world s largest focus group for example steve novick who the new york times declared the first major youtube candidate narrowly lost the democratic senate nomination in oregon while the campaign knew their success on youtube was substantial the site itself still seemed like a black box a novick strategist told the new york times we don t know how many people who saw the ads were oregon voters as opposed to people in norway here s what the novick campaign could have learned using insight the most views in the united states did in fact come from oregon the most views in scandinavia came from sweden not norway novick also had a strong following in california his viewers skewed older and the vast majority were men 84 over 30 of his viewers were in the age range of 45 55 throughout the entire campaign novickforsenate org was the main source of traffic for his videos however in the week prior to the may 20 oregon primary the political blog tpm election central was responsible for over one third of all views coming from external websites novick s own website was a distant second there are many ways both national and local candidates can use this information on and off of youtube is an ad about iraq more popular in virginia or colorado do videos about health care skew old or young does an ad targeted on television to new mexico get most of its views online from the same state are there national pockets of support from which a local candidate might fundraise with five months until november look for more and more politicians using

today unveiled facebook platform calling on all developers to build the next generation of applications with deep integration into facebook distribution across its social graph and an opportunity to build new businesses until now social networks have been closed platforms today were going to end that zuckerberg told an audience of more than 750 developers and partners with this evolution of facebook platform any developer worldwide can build full social applications on top of the social graph inside of facebook the keynote opened the facebook f8 event named to reflect the developer hackathon that ends 8 hours after the address during which new applications will be created for facebook today facebook platform launched with more than 65 developer partners and 85 applications and with the introduction of an example application called video video allows for the simple sharing of personal videos between friends within facebook as well as the creation and sending of video messages directly to and from the facebook inbox to allow users to better share the increasing amount of video being shot from mobile devices video supports mobile uploading of video directly into the application deep integration into facebook website zuckerberg detailed how any developer can build an application that is as integrated into the sites information flow and connections of relationships as facebooks own applications facebook users decide which applications to add and can control their order and appearance within their profiles all with the familiar facebook design users can always remove applications including those built by facebook and will have their granular privacy controls maintained across applications facebook introduced a new markup language facebook markup which along with its previously released apis allows developers to build applications fully integrated into the site facebook markup includes features such as dynamic information tags conditional privacy tags image caching and flash developers can build anything they want in full unlimited application pages on facebook called the canvas pages and applications also can have a box in users profiles and navigation mass distribution through the social graph applications will gain distribution through what zuckerberg called the social graph the network of real connections through which people communicate and share information facebook and all social networks have two core elements the social graph and the applications that run on it because of the efficient spreading of information through the social graph existing facebook applications such as photos have grown to leaders in their categories the social graph is the changing the way the world works zuckerberg said we are at a time in history when more information is available and people are more connected than they ever have been before and the social graph is at the center of that as with existing applications on facebook new

images clicking on it will add that video to a list that is saved for later viewing you can access your quicklist at anytime by clicking on the link at the top of every page or by clicking the quicklist bar under any video you watch you can watch all the videos in your quicklist at once by clicking play all and if you want to keep the list permanently you can save it as a playlist we ve also been working diligently to combat two issues that have been somewhat plaguing youtube lately abusive flaggers and spammers we get a lot of emails about both problems and although we re not able to respond to everyone individually please be rest assured that we are actively working on both of these issues and developing ways to abolish this type of abuse from the site it s one of our highest

at youtube thanks to all of you we ve been going through unprecedented growth most days it seems we can barely catch our breath trying to keep up with everything and sometimes i sit at my desk and look around at the 20 or so people around me and cannot believe how far we ve come in such a short period of time no matter how fast we grow or how large we may become our primary goal is and will always be about being in touch with our users and providing them the best online video experience possible that being said we ve gotten a fair amount of emails lately about the new 10 minute limit we ve implemented for video uploads for those of you not familiar with this change we ve always had a 100mb file limit for uploads we also recently implemented a 10 minute length limit this change won t impact the vast majority of our users we know that over 99 of videos uploaded are already under 10 mins and we also know that most of our users only watch videos that are under about 3 minutes in length so if most of our users are uploading and watching short form video clips why even bother to make the change if it ain t broke don t fix it right well if you ve followed our blog postings or any of the press articles you know we re constantly trying to balance the rights of copyright owners with the rights of our users we poked around the system a bit and found that these longer videos were more likely to be copyrighted videos from tv shows and movies than the shorter videos posted however we also recognize that there are legit content creators out there who may have videos over 10 mins so we ve created a premium content program for those of you with professional produced videos what about the little guys you ask we hear ya we know that although most users are uploading short form clips there are those of you out there that are video bloggers or amateur film makers that have legitimate user generated content over 10 mins and obviously this is not an ideal situation for you we recognize that and we re actively working on a solution that will allow for those of you with longer form user generated content while still preventing copyrighted full length episodes from entering the system in fact if you are a user with videos over 10 mins please contact us we want to hear from you we want to know how you ve been impacted by this change and any thoughts or ideas you may have remember this site is about you and we re listening best maryrose related topics products and

of 4 7 million and 10 million in november 2003 and october 2004 respectively and will not require any additional investment to fund business operations linkedins emphasis for the next six to nine months will be to broaden the utility of its offerings that are free to all members currently the most active members are those who frequently need to contact professionals as part of their job recruiters analysts researchers investment professionals entrepreneurs and management consultants hiring managers and job seekers also search on linkedin whenever they need to identify top recruits or

to stay in touch and strengthen ties with their existing network of business contacts and as most seasoned professionals know the best opportunities tend to come through ones network of relationships

members among the people their connections know for job seekers linkedin has already begun recommending jobs offered by people their colleagues know this matching takes into account the individual career history of members as well as likely future career progression based on the aggregate data of linkedin profiles created by over five million professionals around the world for example if a

currently offered by people his or her connections know recently linkedin has given members the ability to optimize their linkedin profile for pickup by leading internet search engines in 2006 people search is expected to become another major vertical in the internet search category more and more professionals will want to make sure they put their best foot forward when employers prospects and business partners search for them whether on generic search engines or specialized people search engines like linkedin or ziggs later this month anyone visiting the linkedin site will be able to search for people on linkedin and find profiles maintained by professionals who have joined linkedin however to get details such as what former bosses co workers or business partners say about someone visitors will need to sign up for a free linkedin membership membership has additional benefits not offered by regular search engines linkedin members see shared professional connections and can get in touch with the people they find via introductions from people they already know linkedin is committed to making people search smart and easy for example once members find someone who matches their criteria they will be able to find professionals with similar characteristics with a single click also members will be able to create search agents that notify them of new members who match their criteria linkedin is already used frequently to look up people before business meetings to learn about the backgrounds and interests of other meeting attendees like co workers suppliers or potential customers similarly job seekers routinely look up the profiles of employees who will be interviewing them some job seekers even use linkedin to get in touch people who used to work for their potential future boss when it comes to career success degrees of separation are generally more important than academic degrees as linkedin is becoming a profitable internet business the company has set its sights on becoming the most valuable web site for business users around the world the company currently has 50 employees and will grow its staff based on increased revenue from premium accounts job listings and advertising the company is expecting the rate of membership growth to further accelerate in 2006 it took linkedin three years to gain five million members given current accelerating growth the company anticipates that the next five million members will join linkedin over the next ten months and bring linkedins total membership to 10 million before the end of 2006 while a certain percentage of new members will directly contribute to the companys bottom line by upgrading their account or posting a job each new member adds value to the linkedin network by contributing his or her professional profile the value of the network grows stronger with each new member in new people and in trusted professional connections many will also click on an ad or invite their trusted contacts

on the site really piss you off we want to hear it all the good the bad and the ugly secondly we want you to know us how we work what we re doing and the challenges we deal with we get such an intimate view sometimes a little too intimate admittedly into the lives of so many of users it s about time you start seeing us as well so what have we been up to lately thanks to all of you our growth has been absolutely phenomenal these past months and as you can probably imagine with such rapid growth comes a whole host of scalability problems believe me these are the best kind of problems to have but they are still problems none the less and we ve spent much of our time and energy focused on just dealing with the amount of traffic we re getting this has been a bit frustrating for all of us since it distracts us from improving the site and working on new features as much as we would like to however we re continuing to do things to improve the scalability and stability of our site which will give us more time to focus on what matters most bringing you all the features you want to see we did push out some new features this week that we re all pretty excited about we d love to get your feedback seriously developing features in a black box sucks so let us know what you think for your viewing pleasure i put together some clips of all us here at youtube i have to admit to being an imovie novice so please excuse the amateur editing the video opens in chad s garage oh so many months sketching out the very first layout drawings of the site that s steve our other fearless leader taking the video and talking in the background this is followed by our last day working in our vc s office first days in our new office and out to dinner celebrating our funding close no more

check back here often for more updates features ideas and feedback here are all the new features we just released again we encourage your thoughts ideas and feedback logged in home page we finally cleaned this page up it s been one of my personal 1 pet peeves with the site that i d rather see the logged out home page than the logged in home page every single time i login all i see is my subscribed videos and all of the cool new content is pushed way down the page so we finally cleaned this up and added a cool new scrolling format for viewing videos we ve also added this video inbox idea basically anytime someone sends you a video or you get a subscription it will appear in your video inbox subscriptions center again we just cleaned up the ui for this feature but we also added the ability to subscribe to tags conceptually i really dig the idea of subscribing to tags and i m eager to see if the community uses this feature new video player new look and feel for the video player hopefully you all will find this cleaner and easier to use blocking reporting a user sure we would all like to believe that people are basically good but unfortuently the truth of the matter is on any site like ours there are going to be problem users blocking a user is now the easiest way to stop a harassing or malicious user from both your message center and from the user s profile page you can choose to block that user this prevents the user from commenting on your videos or sending you messages additionally you can report a user to us from their profile page if you feel the user has been continuously abusing youtube or posting offensive content message center we cleaned up some of the old annoying things about the message center like not being able to delete new messages hopefully this will make the message center easier to use and will help encourage inter member communications profileswe added my recent videos to all user profiles this is really just a baby step

announced the release of linkedin jobs the internets first relationship powered job network the company also announced the public availability of the linkedin jobsinsider a browser companion that informs job seekers of inside connections they have to employers when they browse major internet job boards linkedin jobs is linkedins first premium service it follows the preview release of a services marketplace which enables professionals on linkedin to find business service providers recommended by their trusted contacts the launch of these new applications further strengthens the value of linkedin to its more than two million users where over 500 000 introductions have already been facilitated to help users get in touch with the job candidates industry experts and business partners they want to reach linkedin jobs is a relationship powered job network that connects job applicants with the hiring managers hr professionals or recruiters representing the jobs listed on linkedin on linkedin jobs candidates not only find open positions that match their interests but also get background information on the job poster that can help them tailor their cover letter more importantly job seekers can learn which of their existing professional contacts can introduce them to the hiring manager or recruiter or to someone who knows these key contacts candidates who come referred by a company employee have a significantly higher chance of landing a job than those who apply via traditional internet job boards according to a recent study by careerxroads employee referrals account for 28 5 percent of external hires while the largest online job board accounts for only 2 8 percent of external hires since referrals are the preferred source of candidates for employers linkedin jobs dramatically increases the chances that job seekers land the job they want by helping them identify which of their existing contacts can refer them to the hiring manager or to someone who knows the hiring manager rob sullivan author of getting your foot in the door when you dont have a leg to stand on explains linkedin jobs is unlike anything currently available it enables candidates to network their way into target companies on the strength of their existing business relationships at the same time companies benefit because they gain a ready made network of referrals and independent references for the candidates under consideration for companies this is particularly compelling because it provides valuable insights into the trustworthiness reliability and work ethic of potential candidates factors that are difficult to assess through resumes and interviews alone hiring managers hr professionals and recruiters have flocked to linkedin jobs because it enables them to leverage referrals from their existing professional relationships to prioritize applicants and to discover which of their own contacts know people who have had experience working with the candidate 75 percent of all listings posted on linkedin jobs so far have been for mid to senior levels and 7 percent have been posted for senior executive positions said linkedin user allan techko regional recruiting manager at compuware corporation who filled a project manager position using linkedin jobs by posting our open positions on linkedin i was able to reach a pool of candidates that is not available on traditional job boards since professionals use linkedin to find business partners industry experts and recommended service providers linkedin jobs gives me access to a group of highly qualified candidates who are currently employed and therefore not spending their time on internet job boards another linkedin user will lopes vp and general manager at audible had tried various job sites including careerbuilder and craigslist to find the right candidate for a director of project management position within one day of posting the position on linkedin jobs will received stephen harris application and it instantly stood out the resume looked similar to some of the others i had received but i saw on his linkedin profile that david simpson a former colleague of mine at audible knew stephen stephen had also asked david to reach out to me via linkedin about his application and david sang stephens praises i asked stephen to come in for an interview right away he was highly qualified and the interviews went very well as a result we extended him an offer for a full time position which he accepted for stephen the job listing on linkedin stood out when he saw that one of his contacts used to work at audible and was linked to will lopes i had no idea that i was so close to someone at the company and i appreciated being able to learn more about will and the company through some of the people we both knew he said in a recent survey of linkedin users who searched for a job on linkedin 58 percent of the 1 400 respondents rated having an inside connection to the hiring manager as very important 51 percent of respondents rated it as somewhat or very likely that they will find their next job through linkedin jobs linkedin is committed to helping professionals find inside connections for jobs whether or not the position is listed on linkedin to support this endeavor the company also today released the linkedin jobsinsider a browser companion that informs users which of their existing contacts know people who work at target companies as they search major internet job boards the linkedin jobsinsider operates entirely in the background it only activates when users search major job boards at that point a research pane opens on the left hand side of the browser showing users inside connections they have to the company posting the position all employees listed at the target company are registered linkedin users who have specifically indicated that they are willing to help job seekers by providing them with additional information about the position or referring them on to the hiring manager job seekers can then choose which of their own contacts theyd like to make the introduction to help them land the job they want almost half of the contact
