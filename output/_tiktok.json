    "description": "Time doesn’t feel like it’s moving at a usual pace, but one consistent reminder to help people notice the change of months is a concept called \"seasons.\" Among those seasons, none has a flair for drama more than autumn. For those who live in climates where the leaves change into a rainbow of well, autumn colors, people are inspired by the peak fall season to bob for apples, put pumpkin in their lattes, and watch the leaves fall. Creators on TikTok have brought the natural sights of the season onto the platform, showing the community what fall looks like in their neck of the woods. By watching others jump into leaf piles, drink pumpkin things, and wear scarves, everyone can enjoy the season, no matter where they live.",
