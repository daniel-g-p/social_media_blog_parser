Google, a case that could dramatically change the way companies and users engage with content online. The case addresses Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that has held for nearly three decades that “no provider or user” of a service can be held liable for others’ speech. While much of the conversation around 230 focuses on the world’s largest social media platforms, what’s missing is that 230 also protects everyday Internet users. This includes protections when users interact with online content, whether that’s leaving a two-star review for a restaurant, upvoting or downvoting content on Reddit, or editing a public source like Wikipedia. Because Reddit is a community-oriented platform, we are deeply concerned with the impact Gonzalez could have on real people. That’s why last month, Reddit filed an amicus brief alongside a group of our user-moderators, who are as much at risk as we are.Understanding the basics of Section 230 230 promotes free expression by enabling platforms to host diverse viewpoints while also allowing them to remove harmful content, like harassment, non-consensual sexual media, or revealing someone’s home address. As Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted in the Gonzalez oral arguments, it protects not just companies from frivolous lawsuits, but also everyday people. It also helps to ensure that smaller tech companies can compete against the big players. It does not shield people who are engaging in illegal activity. All of this results in a safer, more vibrant Internet, and all of it is at risk as the Supreme Court weighs in on 230 for the first time in Gonzalez v. Google. Without 230, the Internet could be reduced to the worst extremes. While some may argue that 230 is a shield allowing companies to leave up too much content, others will say it’s a censorship tool. However, without 230, companies would be incentivized to more heavily censor content, or to carry everything—even harmful content and spam. A world without 230 is even more polarized than the one we live in today. Gonzalez asks whether online “recommendations” are excepted from 230’s protections. But there’s no simple way to define what a “recommendation” is. When you upvote or downvote content on Reddit, is that a recommendation? When a search platform returns good results instead of spam, is that a recommendation? The real result of weakening 230 will be countless lawsuits brought over petty disagreements and courts wasting time deciding the merits of everything on the Internet.Protecting Reddit, our moderators, and users The concern about frivolous litigation isn’t hypothetical. Reddit and our moderators have been sued on multiple occasions, often for petty reasons or jokes. 230 allows these suits to be dismissed and serves as a deterrent to meritless plaintiffs. Without 230, people could not safely moderate, rate, or interact with content, making online communities and conversations less safe, less colorful, and less relevant, or destroying them altogether. It would also harm both users’ free speech and their freedom to associate with like-minded individuals. Just listen to the Reddit moderators who contributed to our amicus brief: “To make it possible for platforms such as Reddit to sustain content moderation models where technology serves people, instead of mastering us or replacing us, Section 230 must not be attenuated by the Court in a way that exposes the people in that model to unsustainable personal risk, especially if those people are volunteers seeking to advance the public interest or others with no protection against vexatious but determined litigants.” u/AkaashMaharaj “Indicating [that] my actions as a single individual performing [a moderation] role in my spare time are the same as Google’s automated challenges suggest that any individual who litigates for any reason against platforms like Reddit should enjoy the same protections as a victim of terrorism. This is not consistent with what I consider a standard of freedom or free speech.” Anonymous moderator “Subreddit[s]...can have up to tens of millions of active subscribers, as well as anyone on the Internet who creates an account and visits the community without subscribing. Moderation teams simply can't handle tens of millions of independent actions without assistance. Losing [automated tooling like Automoderator] would be exactly the same as losing the ability to spamfilter email, leaving users to hunt and peck for actual communications amidst all the falsified posts from malicious actors engaging in hate mail, advertising spam, or phishing attempts to gain financial credentials.” u/Halaku Should the Court roll back 230, it could also significantly reduce the ability of smaller platforms—essentially all but the few largest social media companies—to compete, or put them out of business altogether. These largest platforms have near-unlimited legal budgets and would likely be least affected by changes to 230. Real people and smaller companies would be hit the hardest. We believe a better path lies with Congress directly addressing some of the real problems on the Internet by, for example, requiring transparency about how platforms use algorithms and protecting people’s privacy online. As our amicus brief outlines, sweeping, poorly understood changes could risk breaking the Internet entirely, especially since today’s 230 already does not protect platforms and users who are breaking the law. The Court should not “move fast and break things” by stepping in and drastically changing Section 230."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/sharing-our-findings-around-a-data-security-incident","date":"2023-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Sharing Our Findings Around a Data Security Incident","text":"Reddit recently experienced a data security incident in which someone outside of Reddit accessed some of our internal systems using a sophisticated phishing campaign. Safety, security, and transparency are top priorities at Reddit, so we are sharing this update on our response and findings. What Happened? On February 5, 2023, Reddit became aware of a phishing campaign targeting Reddit employees. After obtaining one employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal documents and internal business information. The information that was accessed may have included limited Reddit code, limited contact information for a small number of company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information (no high risk data was accessed such as credit card details, company financial information, account passwords, campaign strategy or performance). Production systems, including Reddit Ads platform, were not impacted and continue to operate as normal. Based on our investigation thus far, we have no evidence to suggest that any Reddit information has been published or distributed online. How Did We Respond? Our employee self-reported and the Security team responded quickly to remove the infiltrator’s access, notify law enforcement, and commence an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported and are being investigated by law enforcement. We’re continuing to investigate the situation internally and working to fortify our security posture against these types of attacks. Our goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/expanding-our-senior-leadership-team-congratulations-and-welcome","date":"2022-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Expanding Our Senior Leadership Team: Congratulations and Welcome!","text":"As we embark on a new year at Reddit, we extend our congratulations to Harold Klaje, who has been promoted to Reddit’s first-ever Chief Revenue Officer, as well as Neal Hubman, who joins the executive team as Vice President of Global Client Solutions.

Based on earned Karma points, the card places redditors into one of three categories of Rare, Epic, or Legendary. To add to the experience, it also displays their most recent Avatar, the top three visited communities, and assigns a generated persona gathered from the topics they were most interested in. Users can download and share this unique card on and off Reddit to highlight their Reddit Recaps with others. To help protect privacy, users can decide if they do or don’t want to display their username and Avatars when sharing their Recaps. Turning off the username shows \"Redditor\" instead of a username, and turning off the avatar shows a generic Snoo. The Road to Recap To celebrate the return of Recap, users were also granted access to free Avatar accessories that dropped throughout the fall in the Avatar Builder, including the Tardigrade, Narwhal, and Banana Mask.

Now, onto the fun, weird, exciting, and heartwarming Reddit moments of the past year. From embracing inner-kid energy and celebrating special moments, to seeking advice and joining together for good, redditors kept it real this year. Let’s take a look at the moments, communities, and conversations at the heart of Reddit in 2022. Keeping it real (because we needed to in 2022) This year, redditors leaned into their humanness and normalized messing up. r/tifu (which means Today I F***ed Up) jumped 20 positions in just one year, going from the #47 most-viewed community to #27. Whether people wanted to share about their music choices, misuse of office supplies, or chaotic work video calls, they knew where to find their community in r/tifu. Redditors continued to keep it real with their desire for genuine feedback from others, so much that r/amitheasshole became the #1 most-viewed community on the platform. Here people asked if they were wrong for things like teaching their 4-year-old niece a new word and questionable paper airplane contest strategies. r/AskReddit rose to become the #2 most-viewed community on the platform and the curiosity of opinions didn’t stop there—r/AskMen and r/AskWomen saw respective 59% and 52% increases in views this year, compared to last year, as people sought honest conversations there, from inspiring quotes to quality of life. Alongside this shift toward embracing humanness, many redditors sought out wholesome and joyful moments to upvote and comment on. You know, spreading the love! Enter: r/mademesmile, which saw a 45% increase in views compared to last year—making it the #38 most-viewed subreddit overall. Some of the biggest smiles came from posts about brave cancer survivors, sleepy baby otters, and proposals in mid-air. Redditors didn’t just learn about themselves—they also learned about the world around them and beyond. There was a major movement to understand what was happening across the globe and not just in their backyards, as r/worldnews became the #3 most-viewed community. r/ukraine had 1.8 billion views (a 76,000% increase from last year) and 6M+ posts and comments in 2022 alone, showing how redditors cared to stay informed and show their support. In the tech category, r/space went from the #11 to the #4 most-viewed subreddit, a 79% year-over-year (YoY) increase in views, and an awe-inspiring tool allowed redditors to explore outer space further. Expanding on last year’s focus on URL to IRL, where redditors were catalysts for change both online and in the real world, this year redditors didn’t just talk about climate change, they also took action. Communities like r/nolawns, r/climateoffensive, and r/guerillagardening all saw massive increases in views, which hopefully resulted in increased sustainability and climate advocacy. Redditors shared climate change research, grass-free yard inspiration, and more. r/place: Breaking the internet, again Speaking of taking meaningful action together and thinking collaboratively, this year redditors went above and beyond with their creative contributions to r/place. As many of you know, r/place is a collaborative digital canvas on which a single redditor can only place a single tile every five minutes. In this year’s 87-hour run of the project, Redditors from 236 countries and territories contributed 160+ million tiles—adding all kinds of art, memes, and memorable moments. Though it was only a four-day event, r/place was the #16 most-viewed subreddit, and the most upvoted post in all of 2022. Here’s a look at some of the numbers that reflect Reddit’s awesome community: Views: 1.1+ billion Place total canvas views: 157+ millionTotal redditors who placed a tile: 10.4+ millionHeight of r/place activity: 5.9+ million tiles placed per hour In addition to those broad themes, Reddit continued to be a home to laughs, tears, courage, bravery, and of course, a whole lot of (wonderful) weirdness—a beautiful mess, if you will. Now that we’ve continued to keep it real, even in this report, let’s take a look at Reddit by the numbers in 2022 Reddit is home to more than 100,000 active communities around the world;In 2022, redditors created 430+ million posts, a 14% increase YoY;As of November 20, we’ve seen 2.5+ billion total comments, a 7% increase YoY, and 24+ billion upvotes.

Or keep a finger on the pulse of tomorrow’s trends? Look no further than Reddit, a digital crystal ball full of the communities and conversations that are shaping the future. It may be hard to believe it but our r/bitcoin community was established in 2010, and to put that into context, that’s the same year the first iPad was released. What’s more, r/electricvehicles started in 2009 and r/smarthome in 2013, many years before either of the technologies became mainstream, so there’s no denying that Reddit users have long pointed us to what’s coming next. Understanding how consumers are thinking about the products and services of tomorrow is key to unlocking marketing success today, and that’s exactly what we’ll be unveiling at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) next year as part of our very first activation at the event. It’s time to read the (tech) tea leaves We know that redditors are ahead of the curve. Almost half of our U.S. users identify as tech enthusiasts and 45% consider themselves “early adopters” [1]. Discussions on Reddit between experts and enthusiasts surface opinions, insights and overall sentiment, which can often offer a glimpse into the future. To help marketers better leverage these insights, we’re releasing new research at CES that will showcase the conversations happening today and what they tell us about what’s to come. Our research shows that Reddit users believe the future is closer than it seems, that divisive concepts and innovations like the metaverse, drones, and biometrics-driven tech are here to stay, and that there’s great promise in the future’s ability to optimize our lives, from sleep tracking to DNA-personalized vitamins, to smart glasses and toothbrushes. All of this and so much more will be unveiled alongside data-driven recommendations for how brands can action and activate around these insights. “Reddit is a place where people come to form and inform opinions. There’s a level of richness to the conversations taking place that tell us so much about the world around us and how people are thinking and feeling – Reddit communities provide an unofficial (and free) market research group on any given topic,” said Reddit Director of Global Insights, Rob Gaige. “However, not everyone knows how to navigate this information, and with this research, we aim to help brands understand how their audiences are showing up today in order to better plan for tomorrow.” Introducing Reddit Future Tellers at CES We’re bringing the best of Reddit to life at CES this year with our “Future Tellers” installation. It’s a uniquely Reddit experience that will guide guests through an interactive house of clairvoyance and provide the opportunity to gaze into the future through the lens of our most forward-thinking communities. Hosted at the Wynn Hotel, Reddit’s Future Tellers will arm brands and marketers with the tools, insights, and inspiration to drive meaningful business outcomes on and off the Reddit platform. Here’s a taste of what to expect: The Reddit community Crystal Ball: A digital art installation that, with the push of a button, showcases ideas and predictions around the future of tech, gaming, transportation, and more, from Reddit’s leading communities on these topics, served up as easy-to-digest thought startersRead your Communi-Tea Leaves: A tea bar that showcases key vertical-focused conversations and threads on Reddit – from media and entertainment to Web3 – that are driving opinions and culture, to demonstrate the origins of these trends within Reddit communities, and help marketers predict what’s coming next Prediction Challenge: Guests can try their hand at telling the future themselves and see how their predictions stack up against those of the Reddit community “With so many broad industry shifts bringing uncertainty to the year ahead, understanding attitudes and perspectives, and how to reach audiences in relevant, meaningful ways has never been more important,” said Timo Pelz, VP of Business Marketing. “Online communities provide a valuable backdrop for a deeper level of consumer connection, and our inaugural CES activation will not only showcase the opportunity for brands on Reddit, but will help inform wider business strategies with forward-facing insights.” Find us at CES 2023 in the Alsace Ballroom of the Wynn Hotel from 9:00am - 5:00pm Thursday, January 5 and Friday, January 6, 2023.

With more than 100,000 active communities from around the world across Reddit, there are a lot of conversations happening in any given moment.

Some of our favorite memories out of the United Kingdom: Big Ben - Maybe it was worth the wait after all I’m Mike Spencer, Executive Producer of Love Island. Ask Me Anything! Now onto the fun, weird, exciting, and heartwarming Reddit moments of the past year around the world. Keeping it real (because we needed to in 2022) This year, redditors leaned into their humanness and normalized messing up. r/tifu (which means Today I F***ed Up) jumped 20 positions in just one year, going from the #47 most-viewed community to #27. Whether people wanted to share about their music choices, misuse of office supplies, or chaotic work video calls, they knew where to find their community in r/tifu. Redditors continued to keep it real with their desire for genuine feedback from others, so much that r/amitheasshole became the #1 most-viewed community on the platform. Here people asked if they were wrong for things like teaching their 4-year-old niece a new word and questionable paper airplane contest strategies.. r/AskReddit rose to become the #2 most-viewed community on the platform and the curiosity of opinions didn’t stop there—r/AskMen and r/AskWomen saw respective 59% and 52% increases in views this year, compared to last year, as people sought honest conversations there, from inspiring quotes to quality of life. Alongside this shift toward embracing humanness, many redditors sought out wholesome and joyful moments to upvote and comment on. You know, spreading the love! Enter: r/mademesmile, which saw a 45% increase in views compared to last year—making it the #38 most-viewed subreddit overall. Some of the biggest smiles came from posts about brave cancer survivors, sleepy baby otters, and proposals in mid-air. Redditors didn’t just learn about themselves—they also learned about the world around them and beyond. There was a major movement to understand what was happening across the globe and not just in their backyards, as r/worldnews became the #3 most-viewed community. r/ukraine had 1.8 billion views (a 76,000% increase from last year) and 6M+ posts and comments in 2022 alone, showing how redditors cared to stay informed and show their support. In the tech category, r/space went from the #11 to the #4 most-viewed subreddit, a 79% year-over-year (YoY) increase in views, and an awe-inspiring tool allowed redditors to explore outer space further. Expanding on last year’s focus on URL to IRL, where redditors were catalysts for change both online and in the real world, this year redditors didn’t just talk about climate change, they also took action. Communities like r/nolawns, r/climateoffensive, and r/guerillagardening all saw massive increases in views, which hopefully resulted in increased sustainability and climate advocacy. Redditors shared climate change research, grass-free yard inspiration, and more. r/place: Breaking the internet, again Speaking of taking meaningful action together and thinking collaboratively, this year redditors went above and beyond with their creative contributions to r/place. As many of you know, r/place is a collaborative digital canvas on which a single redditor can only place a single tile every five minutes. In this year’s 87-hour run of the project, Redditors from 236 countries and territories contributed 160+ million tiles—adding all kinds of art, memes, and memorable moments. Though it was only a four-day event, r/place was the #16 most-viewed subreddit, and the most upvoted post in all of 2022. Here’s a look at some of the numbers that reflect Reddit’s awesome community: Views: 1.1+ billion Place total canvas views: 157+ millionTotal redditors who placed a tile: 10.4+ millionHeight of r/place activity: 5.9+ million tiles placed per hour In addition to those broad themes, Reddit continued to be a home to laughs, tears, courage, bravery, and of course, a whole lot of (wonderful) weirdness—a beautiful mess, if you will. Now that we’ve continued to keep it real, even in this report, let’s take a look at Reddit by the numbers in 2022 Reddit is home to more than 100,000 active communities around the world;In 2022, redditors created 430+ million posts, a 14% increase YoY;As of November 20, we’ve seen 2.5+ billion total comments, a 7% increase YoY, and 24+ billion upvotes.

(223,200 upvotes) From TV shows that made them cry or movies that made them gasp, redditors knew where to go to chat about their opinions (and hopefully not give too many spoilers). Whether they binged from their couches or grabbed popcorn in theaters, redditors gobbled up Movies and TV, with incredible growth in both categories. Music fans also got a treat this year when u/postmalone graced Reddit with his first post and a tease drop of his new songs.

Fosse quando as pessoas quisessem compartilhar suas preferências musicais, o uso indevido de materiais de escritório ou chamadas de vídeo caóticas no trabalho, elas sempre souberam qual era a comunidade certa para compartilhar isso, o r/tifu. Os Redditors continuaram mandando a real querendo receber opiniões verdadeiras das pessoas. Tanto é que o r/amitheasshole tornou-se a comunidade mais visitada na plataforma. Neste subreddit, as pessoas perguntaram se estavam erradas por fazer coisas como ensinar uma nova palavra a uma sobrinha de 4 anos e comer um bolo sozinhas. O r/AskReddit ganhou posições e tornou-se a segunda comunidade mais visitada na plataforma, e a curiosidade por opiniões não parou por aí.O r/AskMen e o r/AskWomen tiveram aumentos de 59% e 52%, respectivamente, nas visualizações deste ano em comparação com o ano passado, enquanto as pessoas buscavam verdadeiras discussões por lá, que englobavam desde citações inspiradoras até questionamentos sobre a qualidade de vida. Junto com essa mudança para adotar qualidades humanas, muitos redditors procuraram momentos plenos e alegres para dar upvotes e comentar. Sabe? Espalhando o amor! Como exemplo, o r/mademesmile, que teve um aumento de 45% nas visualizações em comparação com o ano passado, tornando-se o 38º subreddit mais visto globalmente. Alguns dos maiores sorrisos foram provocados por posts sobre pessoas corajosas que sobreviveram ao câncer, bebês-lontra sonolentos e pedidos de casamento em pleno ar. Os redditors não aprenderam só sobre si mesmos, aprenderam também sobre o mundo ao seu redor e muito mais. Houve um grande movimento para entender o que estava acontecendo no mundo, e não apenas em seus quintais, já que o r/worldnews tornou-se a terceira comunidade mais vista. O r/ukraine teve 1,8 bilhão de visualizações (um aumento de 76.000% em relação ao ano passado) e mais de 6 milhões de posts e comentários só em 2022, o que mostra que os redditors se preocuparam em demonstrar apoio e se manterem informados. Na categoria da tecnologia, o r/space passou do subreddit nº 11 para o nº 4 entre os mais vistos com um aumento de 79% nas visualizações em comparação com o ano anterior, além de lançarem uma ferramenta muito inspiradora que permitiu que os redditors explorassem ainda mais o espaço sideral. Continuando com o foco do ano passado de trazer a URL para a IRL (a vida real), no qual redditors foram catalisadores de mudanças tanto online quanto no mundo real, redditors neste ano não só falaram sobre as mudanças climáticas, como também agiram. Comunidades como o r/nolawns, r/climateoffensive e r/guerillagardening tiveram grandes crescimentos de visualizações, o que esperamos ter resultado em uma busca maior pela sustentabilidade e pela defesa do clima. Redditors compartilharam pesquisas sobre mudanças climáticas, inspirações para jardins sem gramados e muito mais. r/place: quebrando a internet mais uma vez No que diz respeito a tomar medidas relevantes em conjunto e pensar de forma colaborativa, os redditors deste ano foram além com suas contribuições criativas para o r/place. Como muitos de vocês sabem, o r/place é uma tela digital colaborativa em que um único redditor pode colocar somente uma única peça a cada cinco minutos. Nas 87 horas de execução do projeto deste ano, redditors de 236 países e territórios contribuíram com mais de 160 milhões de peças, adicionando todos os tipos de arte, memes e momentos memoráveis. Embora tenha sido um evento de apenas quatro dias, o r/place chegou a ser o 16º subreddit mais visualizado e o post com mais upvotes durante todo o ano de 2022. Veja, aqui, alguns dos números que refletem a incrível comunidade do Reddit: Visualizações: mais de 1,1 bilhão Total de visualizações da tela do r/place: mais de 157 milhõesTotal de redditors que colocaram uma peça: mais de 10,4 milhõesPico da atividade do r/place: mais de 5,9 milhões de peças colocadas por hora Além desses temas principais, o Reddit continuou sendo um local para risadas, lágrimas, coragem, valentia e, claro, muita coisa estranha (e maravilhosa). Uma bela bagunça, se você achar melhor dizer assim.

O Reddit tem sido, historicamente, um local para gamers de todo o mundo se encontrarem, e continuou sendo em 2022.

Avec plus de 100 000 communautés actives sur Reddit dans le monde entier, le nombre de conversations qui ont lieu à chaque seconde est incroyable. Nous allons donc faire un saut dans nos propres archives pour vous donner un avant-goût des moments les plus mémorables, mettre en lumière nos communautés les plus actives et révéler les principaux moteurs de conversation sur Reddit et ailleurs en 2022.

Vous pouvez également lire cette annonce mondiale en français, allemand, portugais ou espagnol. Entrons maintenant dans le vif du sujet et découvrons les moments drôles, bizarres, réjouissants et réconfortants qui ont laissé sur Reddit une empreinte indélébile cette année. Garder les pieds sur Terre : en 2022, les redditors ont appris des choses sur le monde, ont réfléchi sur eux-mêmes et ont échangé sur des sujets qui comptent.Bienvenue sur le Récap Reddit 2022, où nous allons retracer les temps forts de cette année. Qu'il s'agisse de garder l'énergie de l'enfance et de célébrer les moments particuliers, ou de chercher des conseils et de s'unir pour de bon, les redditors ont gardé les pieds sur Terre cette année.

Que les gens veuillent partager leurs choix musicaux, l'emploi abusif des fournitures de bureau ou les appels vidéo professionnels les plus chaotiques, ils savaient où trouver leur semblables sur r/tifu. Les redditors ont gardé les pieds sur Terre également dans leur souhait d'obtenir des opinions sincères, à tel point que r/amitheasshole est devenu la communauté la plus consultée de la plateforme. Les membres ont pu interroger les autres sur le bien-fondé de choses comme apprendre un nouveau mot à leur nièce de 4 ans et manger du gâteau en solo. r/AskReddit s'est hissé à la deuxième place des communautés les plus consultées de la plateforme, et la curiosité ne s'est pas arrêtée là : r/AskMen et r/AskWomen ont respectivement enregistré une augmentation du nombre de vues de 59 % et 52 % cette année, par rapport à l'an dernier. Les membres ont cherché à engager des conversations honnêtes sur des thèmes comme les citations inspirantes ou la qualité de vie. Outre ce pas vers plus d'humanité, de nombreux redditors ont été en quête de moments simples et candides à upvoter et à commenter. Bref, ils ont voulu répandre l'amour ! Citons par exemple r/mademesmile, dont le nombre de vues a progressé de 45 % par rapport à l'an dernier, et qui est devenu le 38e subreddit le plus consulté. Les plus larges sourires proviennent de publications à propos de courageux survivants du cancer, de bébés loutres endormis et de demandes en mariage à bord d'un avion. Mais si les redditors ont appris des choses sur eux-mêmes, ils se sont aussi intéressés au monde qui les entoure. Nous avons observé une envie de comprendre ce qu'il se passait aux quatre coins du monde, par-delà les frontières, comme en témoigne r/worldnews qui est devenu la troisième communauté la plus consultée. r/ukraine a enregistré 1,8 milliard de vues (soit une progression de 76 000 % par rapport à l'année dernière) et plus de 6 millions de publications et de commentaires rien qu'en 2022, ce qui montre combien les redditors ont à cœur de rester informés et de manifester leur soutien. Dans la catégorie de la tech, r/space est passé de la 11e à la 4e place, soit une augmentation du nombre de vues de 79 % d'une année sur l'autre, et un outil impressionnant a permis aux redditors d'explorer les confins de l'espace. Dans la continuité de l'accent mis l'an dernier sur le pont entre le monde virtuel et le monde réel (ou de l'URL à l'IRL, pour « In real life »), où les redditors impulsaient des changements tant sur la toile que dans le monde réel, cette année, les redditors ont certes parlé du changement climatique, mais ils ont également agi. Des communautés comme r/nolawns, r/climateoffensive et r/guerillagardening ont toutes constaté une augmentation exponentielle de leur nombre de vues, ce qui, espérons-le, a incité au développement durable et à la promotion de la lutte contre le changement climatique. Les redditors ont partagé des études sur le changement climatique, des idées de création de jardins, etc. r/place : à l'assaut d'Internet En parlant de prendre des initiatives ensemble et d'unir nos cerveaux, cette année, les redditors ont rivalisé de créativité sur r/place. Comme la plupart d'entre vous le savent, r/place est une toile numérique collaborative, où un redditor ne peut placer qu'un seul pixel toutes les cinq minutes. Le projet a duré 87 heures cette année, et les redditors de 236 pays et territoires y ont participé avec plus de 160 millions de pixels, regroupant tous types d'œuvres d'art, de memes et de moments mémorables. Alors même que l'événement n'a duré que quatre jours, r/place a été le 16e subreddit le plus consulté et la publication la plus upvotée de toute l'année 2022. Voici quelques chiffres qui témoignent de cette étonnante communauté Reddit : Vues : plus de 1,1 milliard Nombre total de vues de la toile sur Place : plus de 157 millionsNombre total de redditors ayant placé un pixel : plus de 10,4 millionsFréquence d'activité sur r/place : plus de 5,9 millions de pixels placées par heure Au-delà de ces sujets généraux, Reddit est resté un espace de rires, de larmes, de courage, et bien sûr, de bizarreries (que l'on adore)... Un joyeux bazar, quoi ! Comme nous gardons les pieds sur Terre, y compris dans ce rapport, regardons les chiffres de Reddit pour 2022. Reddit compte plus de 100 000 communautés actives dans le monde.En 2022, les redditors ont créé plus de 430 millions de publications, soit une augmentation de 14 % par rapport à l'année dernière.Le 20 novembre, Reddit enregistrait un total de plus de 2,5 milliards de commentaires, une hausse de 7 % d'une année sur l'autre et plus de 24 milliards d'upvotes.Publications les plus upvotées :r/place: Full screenshot of r/place 2022 (342,600 upvotes)r/interestingasfuck: In 1996 Ukraine handed over nuclear weapons to Russia \"in exchange for a guarantee never to be threatened or invaded\" (335,546 upvotes)r/mademesmile: he finally got his acorn 🥺 (326,900 upvotes)r/aww: Man stops to rescue kitten, gets ambushed by platoon (308,700 upvotes)r/place: Place has ended.

En 2022 (et toutes les autres années, soyons honnêtes), les redditors ont partagé et apprécié des photos et des vidéos de toutes sortes d'animaux, des coyotes joueurs au roi des animaux sur Internet : le chat. En chiffres : Pour la deuxième année consécutive, r/aww a été la communauté la plus consultée de cette catégorie, suivie de r/cats et de r/funnyanimals. r/funnyanimals a enregistré une hausse fulgurante de 652 % du nombre de vues d'une année sur l'autre.

(191,700 upvotes) Des séries et émissions de télé qui les ont fait pleurer aux films qui les ont fait sursauter, les redditors savaient où aller pour donner leur avis (sans trop spoiler...!). Depuis leur canapé ou la salle de ciné, les redditors ont enchaîné les films et les programmes TV, deux catégories qui ont connu une hausse incroyable. Les fans de musique ont eux aussi été gâtés cette année, quand u/postmalone a honoré Reddit de sa première publication et d'un aperçu de ses nouvelles chansons. En chiffres : Sur Reddit, les catégories Films et Télévision ont respectivement enregistré une augmentation de 55 % et de 38 % du nombre de vues d'une année sur l'autre.

Reddit a toujours été un lieu de rencontre pour les gamers du monde entier, et 2022 n'échappe pas à la règle. En chiffres : Avec 30,9 millions d'abonnés, r/gaming est la 4e communauté Reddit au monde qui compte le plus grand nombre d'abonnés.r/eldenring est devenu le subreddit le plus consulté de cette catégorie, et le 8e le plus consulté de la plateforme.

Ein paar unserer schönsten Erinnerungen aus Deutschland:Deutsche tun sich zusammen, um die Ukraine zu unterstützen.Aber auch, um gemeinsam zu stricken, häkeln. nähen und sticken.Werfen wir einen Blick auf die Momente, Communities und Gespräche, die im Jahr 2022 bei Reddit im Mittelpunkt standen. Authentizität ist alles (besonders im Jahr 2022) In diesem Jahr haben Redditoren sich auf ihre Menschlichkeit besonnen und normalisiert, dass jeder mal etwas vermasseln kann. r/tifu (das steht für „Today I F***ed Up“, d. h. „Ich habe heute Mist gebaut“) stieg in nur einem Jahr um 20 Plätze von Rang 47 auf Rang 27 der am häufigsten aufgerufenen Communities. Manche Redditoren wollten über ihre Musikauswahl sprechen, manche über den nicht ganz vorschriftsmäßigen Gebrauch von Büromaterial und manche über chaotische berufliche Videoanrufe – sie alle wussten, dass sie in r/tifu ihre Community finden würden. Die authentischen Redditoren wünschten sich auch authentisches Feedback von anderen – und zwar so sehr, dass r/amitheasshole zur am meisten aufgerufenen Community der gesamten Plattform wurde. Hier fragten Redditoren, ob es ein Fehler war, der 4-jährigen Nichte ein neues Wort beizubringen oder alleine den Kuchen aufzuessen. Die am zweithäufigsten aufgerufene Community war r/AskReddit und die Neugier auf die Meinung anderer hörte dort nicht auf – r/AskMen und r/AskWomen verzeichneten in diesem Jahr einen Anstieg der Aufrufe um 59 % bzw. 52 % im Vergleich zum letzten Jahr. Redditoren suchten dort ehrliche Gespräche, von inspirierenden Zitaten bis hin zum Thema Lebensqualität. Neben diesem Bekenntnis zu mehr Menschlichkeit suchten viele Redditoren nach wohltuenden und freudigen Momenten, die sie upvoten und kommentieren konnten. Du weißt schon: etwas Positives für alle! r/mademesmile zum Beispiel verzeichnete im Vergleich zum Vorjahr einen Anstieg der Aufrufe um 45 % und belegte damit Rang 38 unter den am häufigsten aufgerufenen Subreddits. Am meisten Anklang fanden Beiträge über mutige Menschen, die den Krebs besiegt haben, schlaftrunkene Babyotter und Heiratsanträge in der Luft. Redditoren haben nicht nur etwas über sich selbst gelernt, sondern auch über die Welt um sie herum und darüber hinaus. Viele Leute wollten verstehen, was auf der ganzen Welt passierte, nicht nur bei ihnen in der Nähe. r/worldnews wurde zur am dritthäufigsten aufgerufenen Community. r/ukraine verzeichnete allein im Jahr 2022 1,8 Milliarden Aufrufe (ein Anstieg von 76.000 % gegenüber dem Vorjahr) und mehr als 6 Mio. Beiträge und Kommentare. Dies belegt, dass es Redditoren wichtig war, gut informiert zu bleiben und ihre Unterstützung zu zeigen. In der Kategorie Technologie stieg r/space von Rang 11 auf Rang 4 der am häufigsten aufgerufenen Subreddits auf, was einem Anstieg der Aufrufe um 79 % gegenüber dem Vorjahr (YoY) entspricht. Ein beeindruckendes Tool ermöglichte es Redditoren, das Weltall weiter zu erkunden. Im letzten Jahr gab es eine Bewegung von der Online-Welt in die reale Welt. Dies setzte sich in diesem Jahr dadurch fort, dass Redditoren online sowie offline als Katalysatoren für Veränderungen auftraten. Sie unterhielten sich nicht nur über den Klimawandel, sondern ergriffen auch Maßnahmen. Communities wie r/nolawns, r/climateoffensive und r/guerillagardening verzeichneten alle einen massiven Anstieg der Aufrufe, was hoffentlich zu mehr Nachhaltigkeit und Klimaschutz führte. Redditoren teilten Forschung zum Klimawandel, Inspiration für grasfreie Gärten und vieles mehr. r/place: erneut das Internet im Sturm erobert Apropos gemeinsames Handeln und zusammenarbeit orientiertes Denken: In diesem Jahr haben sich Redditoren mit ihren kreativen Beiträgen zu r/place selbst übertroffen. Wie viele von euch wissen, ist r/place eine gemeinschaftliche digitale Leinwand, auf der ein Redditor nur alle fünf Minuten eine einzige Kachel platzieren kann. Während der diesjährigen 87-stündigen Laufzeit des Projekts trugen Redditoren aus 236 Ländern und Gebieten über 160 Millionen Kacheln bei, die Kunst, Memes und denkwürdige Momente aller Art enthielten. Obwohl dieses Event nur vier Tage lang dauerte, belegte r/place Platz 16 unter den am häufigsten aufgerufenen Subreddits und war der am meisten upgevotete Beitrag im gesamten Jahr 2022. Hier ein Blick auf einige der Zahlen, die die großartige Reddit-Community widerspiegeln:Aufrufe: mehr als 1,1 Milliarden Gesamte Leinwandaufrufe: mehr als 157 MillionenGesamtzahl der Redditoren, die eine Kachel platziert haben: mehr als 10,4 MillionenHöchststand der Aktivität auf r/place: mehr als 5,9 Millionen platzierte Kacheln pro Stunde Neben diesen allgemeinen Themen gab es auf Reddit auch immer wieder Lacher, Tränen, Mut, Tapferkeit und natürlich jede Menge (wunderbare) Verrücktheiten – ein wunderbares Chaos, wenn man so möchte. Nun, da wir auch in diesem Bericht weiterhin authentisch geblieben sind, werfen wir einen Blick auf Reddit in Zahlen im Jahr 2022 Auf Reddit gibt es mehr als 100.000 aktive Communities aus aller Welt.Im Jahr 2022 haben Redditoren über 430 Millionen Beiträge erstellt, was einem Anstieg von 14 % gegenüber dem Vorjahr entspricht.Bis zum 20.

Im Jahr 2022 (und, ganz ehrlich: in allen anderen Jahren auch) haben Redditoren Fotos und Videos von allen möglichen tierischen Freunden geteilt und sich darüber gefreut – von verspielten Kojoten bis hin zum Internet-Tier schlechthin, der Katze.

Keeping it real (because we needed to in 2022) This year, redditors leaned into their humanness and normalized messing up. r/tifu (which means Today I F***ed Up) jumped 20 positions in just one year, going from the #47 most-viewed community to #27. Whether people wanted to share about their music choices, misuse of office supplies, or chaotic work video calls, they knew where to find their community in r/tifu. Redditors continued to keep it real with their desire for genuine feedback from others, so much that r/amitheasshole became the #1 most-viewed community on the platform. Here people asked if they were wrong for things like teaching their 4-year-old niece a new word and questionable paper airplane contest strategies.. r/AskReddit rose to become the #2 most-viewed community on the platform and the curiosity of opinions didn’t stop there—r/AskMen and r/AskWomen saw respective 59% and 52% increases in views this year, compared to last year, as people sought honest conversations there, from inspiring quotes to quality of life. Alongside this shift toward embracing humanness, many redditors sought out wholesome and joyful moments to upvote and comment on. You know, spreading the love! Enter: r/mademesmile, which saw a 45% increase in views compared to last year—making it the #38 most-viewed subreddit overall. Some of the biggest smiles came from posts about brave cancer survivors, sleepy baby otters, and proposals in mid-air. Redditors didn’t just learn about themselves—they also learned about the world around them and beyond. There was a major movement to understand what was happening across the globe and not just in their backyards, as r/worldnews became the #3 most-viewed community. r/ukraine had 1.8 billion views (a 76,000% increase from last year) and 6M+ posts and comments in 2022 alone, showing how redditors cared to stay informed and show their support. In the tech category, r/space went from the #11 to the #4 most-viewed subreddit, a 79% year-over-year (YoY) increase in views, and an awe-inspiring tool allowed redditors to explore outer space further. Expanding on last year’s focus on URL to IRL, where redditors were catalysts for change both online and in the real world, this year redditors didn’t just talk about climate change, they also took action. Communities like r/nolawns, r/climateoffensive, and r/guerillagardening all saw massive increases in views, which hopefully resulted in increased sustainability and climate advocacy. Redditors shared climate change research, grass-free yard inspiration, and more. r/place: Breaking the internet, again Speaking of taking meaningful action together and thinking collaboratively, this year redditors went above and beyond with their creative contributions to r/place. As many of you know, r/place is a collaborative digital canvas on which a single redditor can only place a single tile every five minutes. In this year’s 87-hour run of the project, Redditors from 236 countries and territories contributed 160+ million tiles—adding all kinds of art, memes, and memorable moments. Though it was only a four-day event, r/place was the #16 most-viewed subreddit, and the most upvoted post in all of 2022. Here’s a look at some of the numbers that reflect Reddit’s awesome community: Views: 1.1+ billion Place total canvas views: 157+ millionTotal redditors who placed a tile: 10.4+ millionHeight of r/place activity: 5.9+ million tiles placed per hour In addition to those broad themes, Reddit continued to be a home to laughs, tears, courage, bravery, and of course, a whole lot of (wonderful) weirdness—a beautiful mess, if you will.

With more than 100,000 active communities from around the world across Reddit, there are a lot of conversations happening in any given moment. So we jump in our very own wayback machine to provide insight into 2022's most memorable moments, highlight our most active communities, and reveal the biggest conversation drivers on Reddit and beyond.

Some of our favorite memories out of the United Kingdom: Big Ben - Maybe it was worth the wait after all I’m Mike Spencer, Executive Producer of Love Island. Ask Me Anything! Now onto the fun, weird, exciting, and heartwarming Reddit moments of the past year around the world. Keeping it real (because we needed to in 2022) This year, redditors leaned into their humanness and normalized messing up. r/tifu (which means Today I F***ed Up) jumped 20 positions in just one year, going from the #47 most-viewed community to #27. Whether people wanted to share about their music choices, misuse of office supplies, or chaotic work video calls, they knew where to find their community in r/tifu. Redditors continued to keep it real with their desire for genuine feedback from others, so much that r/amitheasshole became the #1 most-viewed community on the platform. Here people asked if they were wrong for things like teaching their 4-year-old niece a new word and questionable paper airplane contest strategies.. r/AskReddit rose to become the #2 most-viewed community on the platform and the curiosity of opinions didn’t stop there—r/AskMen and r/AskWomen saw respective 59% and 52% increases in views this year, compared to last year, as people sought honest conversations there, from inspiring quotes to quality of life. Alongside this shift toward embracing humanness, many redditors sought out wholesome and joyful moments to upvote and comment on. You know, spreading the love! Enter: r/mademesmile, which saw a 45% increase in views compared to last year—making it the #38 most-viewed subreddit overall. Some of the biggest smiles came from posts about brave cancer survivors, sleepy baby otters, and proposals in mid-air. Redditors didn’t just learn about themselves—they also learned about the world around them and beyond. There was a major movement to understand what was happening across the globe and not just in their backyards, as r/worldnews became the #3 most-viewed community. r/ukraine had 1.8 billion views (a 76,000% increase from last year) and 6M+ posts and comments in 2022 alone, showing how redditors cared to stay informed and show their support. In the tech category, r/space went from the #11 to the #4 most-viewed subreddit, a 79% year-over-year (YoY) increase in views, and an awe-inspiring tool allowed redditors to explore outer space further. Expanding on last year’s focus on URL to IRL, where redditors were catalysts for change both online and in the real world, this year redditors didn’t just talk about climate change, they also took action. Communities like r/nolawns, r/climateoffensive, and r/guerillagardening all saw massive increases in views, which hopefully resulted in increased sustainability and climate advocacy. Redditors shared climate change research, grass-free yard inspiration, and more. r/place: Breaking the internet, again Speaking of taking meaningful action together and thinking collaboratively, this year redditors went above and beyond with their creative contributions to r/place. As many of you know, r/place is a collaborative digital canvas on which a single redditor can only place a single tile every five minutes. In this year’s 87-hour run of the project, Redditors from 236 countries and territories contributed 160+ million tiles—adding all kinds of art, memes, and memorable moments. Though it was only a four-day event, r/place was the #16 most-viewed subreddit, and the most upvoted post in all of 2022. Here’s a look at some of the numbers that reflect Reddit’s awesome community: Views: 1.1+ billion Place total canvas views: 157+ millionTotal redditors who placed a tile: 10.4+ millionHeight of r/place activity: 5.9+ million tiles placed per hour In addition to those broad themes, Reddit continued to be a home to laughs, tears, courage, bravery, and of course, a whole lot of (wonderful) weirdness—a beautiful mess, if you will. Now that we’ve continued to keep it real, even in this report, let’s take a look at Reddit by the numbers in 2022 Reddit is home to more than 100,000 active communities around the world;In 2022, redditors created 430+ million posts, a 14% increase YoY;As of November 20, we’ve seen 2.5+ billion total comments, a 7% increase YoY, and 24+ billion upvotes.

Reddit Celebrates One Year in Germany","text":"Time flies when you’re having fun! 12 months ago, we entered Germany, our first non-English speaking market, with ambitious plans to grow our platform and business locally. Since opening our Berlin office we’ve not only grown our user base (Germany is now home to Reddit’s fourth largest user base globally!), we’ve also built out our advertising business to connect more German brands with Reddit’s unique audiences. Throughout all of this, we’ve continued to build out our local workforce, tripling the size of our German team on the ground. An Evolving German Community Our team in Germany has expanded to now include dedicated local Sales, Community, Operations, and Product and Engineering teams in major cities across the country. With bolstered resources, we’ve been able to continue building out more engaging, meaningful, and locally nuanced experiences for our German users and clients. At the heart of it all is our German audience which continues to be highly engaged, contributing 160M posts, votes and comments each month, a 15% increase year over year. Our German users are also viewing more content than ever – 60% more year over year to be exact – with communities like r/Arbeitsleben, r/de, r/de_lAmA, r/finanzen, r/fragreddit, and r/ich_iel among the most popular for German redditors. With a keen interest in technology, gaming, and regional topics still going strong, it’s clear that as more Germans find their people on Reddit, their interests continue to expand. We’re seeing more German users gravitate to food-related communities with the likes of r/veganDE growing 204% in subscribers year over year, thanks in part to a string of engaging AMAs with experts in vegan cooking, most notably German star chef, Ricky Saward. Popular arts and crafts community, r/Handarbeiten, is another example. The community was awarded Reddit Community Funds for an IRL seasonal knitting project. The Funds covered packages of autumnally-themed yarn and fabrics, which were sent to participating members to knit, crochet, sew and embroider their own thematic masterpieces – including impressive bags to baskets – that they later posted for all to enjoy. A welcome home for brands With a leaned in audience that can’t be found anywhere else online – 41% of Reddit users in Germany aren’t on Facebook and 53% are not on Snapchat [1] – Reddit represents a significant opportunity for brands. We recently partnered with Talk Shoppe to better understand how our German users feel about brand participation on the platform. We found that local users are more likely to trust a brand that participates on Reddit than brands they see advertising on other platforms. What’s more, with Reddit considered a “go-to” place for Germans to learn more about brands and services (+24% compared with other platforms), we found that Reddit helps German users make more informed purchase decisions (+29%) and that Redditors in Germany like when brands interact directly with them (+26%)[2]. [1] GWI Q2 2021 [2]Reddit / Talk Shoppe, Quantitative study, “Find your People”, DE, n=1068, 18-54 y/o, social media users, fielded in Aug-Sep 2022. “The main reason people come to Reddit is to be informed by passionate communities they trust and this makes for an environment of highly engaged, leaned in users who are ready to take action. Reddit users in Germany are coming to the platform because they want to learn more about products and services, so this in turn creates an immense opportunity for brands to reach relevant audiences when they are already actively engaged in the topic or interest,” said Oliver Wendt, Reddit Manager, Large Customer Sales for DACH. “As a brand, being able to tap into an environment where trust is already baked in is pretty unique, and something we are seeing more and more of as more local brands connect with our German user base.” Growing our advertiser base With such strong community engagement and a receptive environment for brand participation, it’s no surprise we’re also seeing more local German advertisers find their home on Reddit as they connect with our local user base. Bethesda, Seven.one, Deutsche Telekom, MSFT, Hutchison Drei Austria GmbH, Nintendo, Walt Disney, IBM EMEA, Babbel, AMD, Delivery Hero, HelloFresh, InnoGames, and TaxFix are just some of the advertisers actively working to reach Reddit’s German audiences through a variety of campaigns. To drive awareness and excitement for a partnership between MINI and Pokémon on a capsule edition of the new MINI Aceman electric car, MINI and its agency Jung von Matt Nerd tapped the Reddit community with a highly successful engagement prompt. Calling on relevant Reddit users—from Pokémon fans to gamers to car enthusiasts—to be part of the limited edition design process, MINI rallied the community to share their favorite Pokémon and inspired accessories for a chance to have them featured on the cars, and rewarded participants with Reddit Gold for their efforts. The post generated more than 1,600 comments from excited users. “Reddit is one of the most important platforms for fandom, pop culture, and community-centric communication. Many brands underestimate not only the power, but also the community’s influence on brand credibility. It’s a hidden champ if you want to build brand equity in subcultures,” said Founder of Jung von Matt NERD, Toan Nguyen. “The value of Reddit was shown in many different layers of our campaign. While Reddit was the perfect place to be right in the middle of fandom communities and gain their trust, it was also a powerful way for us to get their feedback. We know how smart the community is and we did not want to miss any chance to show it. Fandom marketing is about communication at eye-level and genuine appreciation for the community.” For more information and to learn more about reaching our German audience, please contact us."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/strengthening-our-ads-business-leadership","date":"2022-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Strengthening our Ads Business Leadership","text":"As our advertising business continues to scale globally, we are thrilled to announce today two new senior leaders Stephen Riad, Reddit’s VP of Global Mid-Market and SMB Sales, and Roelof van Zwol, Reddit’s VP of Ads Engineering, who join our executive team in newly established roles. Stephen Riad Charged with defining the global strategy and structure for Reddit’s mid-market and small business (MM and SMB) sales organization, Stephen Riad will lead the sales teams responsible for driving monthly active advertiser growth within these important segments, oversee client and agency relationships, and work closely with cross-functional leaders across the business to ensure the strongest solutions for these partners. Stephen joins us from Google where he held senior roles across strategy, sales, operations, and business growth, and was charged with establishing the company’s first MM and SMB acquisition business across the Asia Pacific region. An Australian now based in London with his wife and three children, Stephen’s favorite Reddit communities include r/casualUK and r/boxing, which is not surprising given his background as a competitive boxer. “I’ve been fortunate in my career to see several clients evolve from a small business to an enterprise brand and it’s one of my favorite aspects of the job to contribute to that journey,” said Reddit VP of Global Mid-Market and SMB, Stephen Riad. “Reddit’s ads business has seen incredible growth in recent years but is only scratching the surface of its full capability, and I'm excited to be part of the team to further unlock that potential and drive meaningful business outcomes for clients.” Roelof van Zwol With almost 20 years of experience in machine learning, most recently from Pinterest where he was Head of Monetization Sciences and ML Engineering, Roelof van Zwol is focused on leading the technical strategy, execution, and team behind Reddit’s monetization engine. He is responsible for building the architecture that powers Reddit’s Ads Marketplace and overseeing the Ads Software, Solutions, and Reliability Engineering teams to ensure a best-in-class offering for Reddit advertisers around the world. Prior to Pinterest, Roelof held senior positions at Netflix and Yahoo!, with roles spanning engineering, product innovation, and research contributing to his well-rounded career in tech. Originally from the Netherlands, Roelof lived and worked in Barcelona for several years before settling down in Silicon Valley with his wife and two teenage children. He holds a Masters and Ph.D. in Computer Science and when he’s not working, you’ll likely find him fine-tuning his bass skills or connecting with others doing the same in r/bass. “It’s a thrilling time to join Reddit as online communities are becoming more and more integral to the daily lives of audiences around the world. I personally find myself using Reddit every day, whether it’s to find answers to specific questions or learn and share knowledge around topics that interest me,” said Reddit VP of Ads Engineering, Roelof van Zwol. “Reddit is in a unique position to bring together users and advertisers based on their shared interests and goals, and I’m so pleased to be able to help advance the monetization of Reddit as a platform by bringing more value to advertisers and users alike.” Stephen reports to Reddit’s Global EVP and President of Advertising Harold Klaje, and Roelof reports to Reddit’s EVP of Ads Monetization, Shariq Rizvi. Both start immediately."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-welcomes-dave-habiger-to-board-of-directors","date":"2022-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Reddit Welcomes Dave Habiger to Board of Directors","text":"We are delighted to grow our Board of Directors today with Dave Habiger as the newest addition.

Reddit feiert das einjährige Bestehen in Deutschland","text":"Die Zeit vergeht wie im Flug, wenn man Spaß hat! Vor 12 Monaten sind wir in Deutschland, unserem ersten nicht-englischsprachigen Markt, mit ehrgeizigen Plänen für das Wachstum unserer Plattform und unseres Geschäfts vor Ort gestartet. Seit der Eröffnung unseres Berliner Büros haben wir nicht nur unsere Nutzerzahlen ausgebaut – Deutschland beherbergt nun die viertgrößte User-Base von Reddit weltweit! Darüber hinaus haben wir unser Werbegeschäft weiter vorangetrieben, um immer mehr deutsche Marken mit der einzigartigen Community von Reddit zu verbinden. Während all dieser Entwicklungen konnten wir unsere lokale Belegschaft kontinuierlich vergrößern und unser deutsches Team vor Ort verdreifachen. Eine wachsende Community in Deutschland Unser Team in Deutschland hat sich vergrößert und umfasst nun lokale Teams für Vertrieb, Community, Betrieb sowie Produkt und Technik in den wichtigsten deutschen Städten. Mit den verstärkten Kapazitäten sind wir in der Lage, weiterhin ansprechende, informative und lokal zugeschnittene Inhalte für unsere deutschen Nutzer und Kunden zu entwickeln. Im Mittelpunkt steht unser deutsches Publikum, das sich mit 160 Mio. Beiträgen, Votes und Kommentaren pro Monat kontinuierlich stark engagiert, was einem Anstieg von 15 % im Vergleich zum Vorjahr entspricht. Außerdem sehen sich unsere deutschen Nutzer mehr Inhalte als je zuvor an - 60 % mehr als im Vorjahr, um genau zu sein – wobei Communities wie r/Arbeitsleben, r/de, r/de_lAmA, r/finanzen, r/fragreddit und r/ich_iel zu den beliebtesten unter den deutschen Redditoren gehören. Das große Interesse an Technologie, Gaming und regionalen Themen ist nach wie vor ungebrochen und führt dazu, dass immer mehr deutsche Nutzer auf Reddit ihre Community finden und somit ihre Interessen weiter ausweiten. Wir sehen, dass sich immer mehr deutsche Nutzer zu Communities rund um das Thema Essen hingezogen fühlen, wie z. B. r/veganDE, das im Vergleich zum Vorjahr einen Zuwachs von 204 % an Abonnenten verzeichnet, was unter anderem einer Reihe von spannenden AMAs mit Experten der veganen Küche zu verdanken ist, allen voran dem deutschen Starkoch Ricky Saward. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist die Kunst- und Bastel-Community r/Handarbeiten, die so engagiert ist, dass sie Reddit Community Funds für ein IRL-Community-Strickprojekt erhalten hat. Dabei wurden Garn, Stoff und Nadeln in herbstlichen Farben an die teilnehmenden Mitglieder verschickt, um Kunstwerke zum Thema Herbst zu stricken, häkeln und zu nähen, damit sie diese für alle anderen in der Gruppe präsentieren können – darunter beeindruckende Taschen und Körbe. Ein willkommener Ort für Brands Mit einem Publikum, das nirgendwo sonst online zu finden ist – 41 % der Reddit-Nutzer in Deutschland sind nicht auf Facebook und 53 % nicht auf Snapchat [1]– stellt Reddit eine große Chance für Marken dar. Wir haben uns kürzlich mit Talk Shoppe zusammengetan, um besser zu verstehen, wie unsere deutschen Nutzer über die Beteiligung von Unternehmen auf der Plattform denken. Wir fanden heraus, dass lokale Nutzer einer Marke, die auf Reddit vertreten ist, eher vertrauen als Marken, die sie auf anderen Plattformen werben sehen. Darüber hinaus wird Reddit von den deutschen Nutzern als erste Anlaufstelle angesehen, um mehr über Marken und Dienstleistungen zu erfahren (+24 % im Vergleich zu anderen Plattformen). Außerdem stellten wir fest, dass Reddit den Nutzern in Deutschland dabei hilft, fundiertere Kaufentscheidungen zu treffen (+29 %). Zudem begrüßen deutsche Reddit-Nutzer die direkte Kommunikation mit Brands (+26 %) [2]. [1] GWI Q2 2021 [2] Reddit / Talk Shoppe, Quantitative Studie, “Find your People”, DE, n=1068, in der Social Media Nutzer zwischen 18-54 Jahren, im Zeitraum von Aug-Sep 2022 befragt wurden. „Der Hauptgrund, warum die Menschen zu Reddit kommen, ist, dass sie von leidenschaftlichen Gemeinschaften, denen sie vertrauen, informiert werden wollen. Das schafft eine Umgebung mit hoch engagierten, handlungsbereiten Nutzern. Reddit-Nutzer in Deutschland kommen auf die Plattform, weil sie mehr über Produkte und Dienstleistungen erfahren wollen. „Das wiederum bietet Marken eine große Chance, relevante Zielgruppen zu erreichen, wenn diese sich bereits aktiv mit einem Thema beschäftigen “, sagt Oliver Wendt, Reddit Manager, Large Customer Sales für DACH. „Als Marke in der Lage zu sein, ein Umfeld zu betreten, in dem das Vertrauen bereits vorhanden ist, ist ziemlich einzigartig und etwas, das wir mehr und mehr sehen, da sich immer mehr lokale Brands mit unserer deutschen Nutzerbasis verbinden.“ Ausbau unserer Anzeigenkundenbasis Bei einem so starken Engagement der Community und einem aufgeschlossenen Umfeld für die Beteiligung von Marken ist es keine Überraschung, dass auch immer mehr lokale deutsche Werbetreibende auf Reddit ein Zuhause finden, um mit unserer lokalen User-Base in Kontakt zu treten. Bethesda, Seven.one, Deutsche Telekom, MSFT, Hutchison Drei Austria GmbH, Nintendo, Walt Disney, IBM EMEA, Babbel, AMD, Delivery Hero, HelloFresh, InnoGames und TaxFix sind nur einige der Werbekunden, die aktiv daran arbeiten, das deutsche Reddit-Publikum durch eine Vielzahl von Kampagnen zu erreichen. Um die Partnerschaft zwischen MINI und Pokémon für eine Capsule Edition des neuen MINI Aceman Elektroautos zu fördern, hat der Autobauer und seine Agentur Jung von MATT NERD die Reddit-Community mit einer sehr erfolgreichen Kampagne eingebunden: MINI rief relevante Reddit-Nutzer – von Pokémon-Fans über Gamer bis hin zu Auto-Enthusiasten – dazu auf, Teil des Design-Prozesses für die limitierte Edition zu werden. Die Community wurde aufgerufen, ihre Lieblings-Pokémon und inspirierende Accessoires zu teilen, um eine Chance zu erhalten, diese auf den Autos abzubilden, wobei alle Teilnehmer mit Reddit-Gold für ihre Mühen belohnt wurden. Mehr als 1.600 Kommentare von begeisterten Nutzern folgten auf den Beitrag. „Reddit ist eine der wichtigsten Plattformen für Fankultur, Popkultur und Community-zentrierte Kommunikation. Viele Marken unterschätzen nicht nur die Kraft, sondern auch den Einfluss der Community auf die Glaubwürdigkeit einer Marke. Es ist ein Geheimtipp, wenn man einen Markenwert in Subkulturen aufbauen will“, sagt Toan Nguyen, Gründer von Jung von Matt NERD. „Der Stellenwert von Reddit hat sich in unserer Kampagne auf vielen verschiedenen Ebenen gezeigt. Reddit war der perfekte Ort, um mitten in den Fandom-Communities zu sein und ihr Vertrauen zu gewinnen, aber es war auch eine gute Möglichkeit für uns, ihr Feedback zu bekommen. Wir wissen, wie smart die Community ist, und wir wollten keine Gelegenheit verpassen, das zu zeigen. Beim Fandom-Marketing geht es um Kommunikation auf Augenhöhe und echte Wertschätzung für die Community.“ Für weitere Informationen und um mehr darüber zu erfahren, wie wir das deutsche Publikum erreichen können, wenden Sie sich gerne jederzeit an uns."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/announcing-our-first-alpha-partners-as-we-build-out-reddits-marketing-api-ecosystem","date":"2022-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Reddit for Business"],"title":"Announcing Our First Alpha Partners as We Build Out Reddit’s Marketing API Ecosystem","text":"As we work to build out our developer ecosystem and create industry-leading solutions for our clients, we are thrilled to announce today the first four alpha partners for Reddit’s Ads API.

The official dates for Hispanic Heritage Month purposefully span a month to include several notable events throughout Latin America, which is reflected in the activities that Reddit’s Employee Resource Group (ERG), Organization for LatinX Employees (OLE), planned for the next several weeks. Though Hispanic Heritage Month places an emphasis on Hispanic, OLE has created educational programming and interactive sessions for employees to celebrate the diverse spectrum of LatinX and Hispanic communities. These special events are all anchored around OLE’s theme for the month: “Unidos: ni de aquí, ni de allá” which directly translates to “United: not from here, not from there.” With over 65 million individuals identifying as Hispanic or Latino in the United States alone and more all over the world, we celebrate that no one label or identity could ever contain the vibrance, spirit, and flavor of these unique identities. This year’s theme recognizes different experiences and identities while celebrating a shared unity in the intersection of it all – belonging is found in Unidos. LatinX and Hispanic communities are more of a mosaic than a painting, meaning each unique tile combines to form a complex and beautiful image of migration, hardship, assimilation, discovery, family, and friendship. Each event that OLE is hosting over the next few weeks provides an opportunity for all employees at Reddit to come together and create more shared experiences across our diverse communities. We have the distinguished opportunity to welcome LatinX community leaders to discuss the impact of their work on the LatinX community in the US. OLE is also connecting with Reddit moderators from r/MexicoCity, r/conversas, and r/MexicoFinanciero to learn how they support users and drive Unidad in their communities. Additionally, it wouldn’t be a celebration of Hispanic and LatinX culture if we didn’t cook and enjoy traditional food recipes shared by our employees. Finally, we’ll be highlighting the impact of music across the diaspora with live performances in our offices. Building these cultural connections across our company and celebrating special moments during Hispanic Heritage Month further creates an environment where our employees feel at home. Organization for LatinX Employees (OLE) (founded in 2020): We aim to reflect our diverse communities by being a resource for Reddit employees who have a cultural connection to or identify as Latino/a, Hispanic, LatinX, or for those that simply want to learn more. We strive to be a community group that drives diversity and inclusion while paving the way for Latinos to build, evolve, and enhance their professional development at Reddit and beyond."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/supporting-safe-fair-elections-on-reddit","date":"2022-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Supporting Safe & Fair Elections on Reddit","text":"Voting is at the heart of the Reddit experience, so supporting voter participation and education is an important priority for us. As the United States heads into the 2022 midterm election season, we thought it would be a good time to provide some helpful resources and give a summary of what we do to prepare for elections. Resources and voting support We believe that access to high-quality information is critical to the democratic process and fight against misinformation, so we regularly run voting-related educational campaigns and initiatives. Here are a few resources to support voting in 2022: If you are wondering where or how to vote, you can look up your local polling place through your state elections office here. Vote.gov is also a great resource to learn more about how and where to vote. States have different registration requirements - you can check what you need to vote here. We’ll also have banners displaying this information to US users on key days throughout the election season, including Election Day. This year, we’re partnering with Vote.Org to support their ElectionDay.org initiative which asks companies to provide paid time off to vote. (US Reddit employees can already use unlimited PTO or volunteer hours to vote and / or volunteer on election day.)Starting September 20 until Election Day, we will provide voting resources to users seeking information about civic holidays, such as National Voter Registration Day and Vote Early Day, in Reddit search. We’re also once again providing awards for users to show that they have voted. We’re partners of National Voter Registration Day, National Voter Education Week, and Vote Early Day. We amplify information about these civic holidays on web and mobile through tools like our announcement banner.In July 2022, we announced an AMA (Ask Me Anything) series titled “The 2022 Midterms on Reddit” to help connect redditors with quality voter information ahead of the midterms. Our content and ad policies We have strict sitewide policies against content manipulation, which includes disinformation campaigns, falsified documents, and deepfakes intended to mislead. We also prohibit illegal content, including false information intended to prevent people from voting, such as incorrect information about polling times or locations. We believe political ads are an important part of the democratic process and therefore, we permit them to run on Reddit with certain restrictions. We aim to promote transparency and dialogue in these ads on our platform, and maintain strict policies to ensure they meet these standards. Each political ad is manually reviewed and subject to our Advertising Policy, which prohibits deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising. We also publish all political ads in a dedicated transparency subreddit with detailed information about who purchased the ads, how the ads were targeted, and other useful information. How we protect our platform Our Safety teams enforce our Content Policy at scale using a combination of automated tooling and human review. These teams strengthen our defenses, mitigate threats, and proactively take action against known disinformation agents and other bad actors. (For an example, take a look at the results of our team’s work around the 2020 US election.) As you can imagine, this work is “always on.” In particular, ahead of major world elections, our Safety teams assess potential threats and how adversaries could dissuade people from exercising their vote, disrupt our communities, or cause real world harm. They work closely with our Community team, who serve as a direct point of contact to moderators and deliver vital information about potential threats that may have an impact on their communities. In addition, our Safety teams maintain external partnerships with safety and civil organizations and consult with law enforcement to help us understand emerging issues that might affect Reddit. Additionally, part of the unique nature of Reddit is that information is curated by the upvotes and downvotes of real people, forming a distributed and resilient information ecosystem that is more structurally resistant to manipulation. Our moderators and users are quick to downvote and challenge misleading content at scale, which helps ensure that quality information rises to the top, while suspect content is called out, less visible, or removed. Transparency with our community We also believe transparency is important. We share information about our efforts to detect and mitigate content manipulation directly with our community in r/RedditSecurity, and highlight how we moderate content in our annual Transparency Reports. As noted above, for political ads, we disclose information about the purchasing individual or organization in our Political Ads Transparency Center. We know that keeping Reddit safe, healthy, and real is a serious responsibility - particularly around elections when open discourse is most critical. We’re always working to find new ways to support voting and protect our platform, and we’ll keep our community updated on our efforts."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-acquires-spiketrap","date":"2022-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Reddit Acquires Spiketrap","text":"Reddit is home to the most passionate and engaged conversations on the internet and as we continue to scale our business, we are constantly looking for ways our partners can tap into the unique power of Reddit and reach relevant and leaned-in audiences.

Moderators, in particular, have developed numerous tools and bots to lighten their load and help subreddits function better. That is why today we are opening up a waitlist for our developer platform - a suite of developer tools and resources that will enable and empower developers whose contributions will support millions of users and over 100,000 active communities on Reddit.

Featuring creative by R/GA Australia as well as media strategy and buying led by Initiative, \"Find your people\" will reach Australian audiences through the region’s first-ever national out-of-home, digital and audio campaign that reflects Reddit’s diverse and unquestionably unique communities across Australia. The national campaign draws attention to the special and distinctive interests shared among Australians, in communities such as r/magpies and r/australia, and will appear across out-of-home placements in major cities including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth as well as on radio, podcast and digital channels throughout the country. “People naturally want to connect with others who share similar interests and champion their dreams and this has only intensified in a post-COVID world,” said Claire Waring, Executive Creative Director, R/GA Australia. “Reddit is a unique platform that unites people of all ages and backgrounds. This wealth of humanity creates a huge range of intelligent, hilarious, and heart-warming content that has been the inspiration for this campaign.” Growing our team Down Under With Reddit’s local team tripling in size over the last year, we’ve dedicated resources to our Product, Sales, Marketing, Policy, Engineering, and Community teams. They’re driving user growth and engagement while bringing greater visibility of the incredible local subreddits for Australian Reddit users to join. “The sparks fly when Aussies engage in communities, where their shared interests and experiences are seen, understood, and celebrated with other Reddit users.

The Australian Football League partnered with Reddit by becoming the world’s first sports league to create personalised AFL-themed Reddit Avatars, allowing fans to proudly showcase their footy colours on Reddit throughout the 2022 men’s AFL season. Over 700,000 users around the world saved AFL-themed content to their Reddit Avatar profiles, which enabled them to build their own profile Avatar with the guernseys of their favorite AFL club. When it came to Australian digital bank Up, they wanted to increase awareness of their banking products among Gen Z audiences. By targeting technology, gaming, music, and finance communities, Up saw a 51% month-over-month increase in ad-driven conversions through a combination of four front-page takeovers and promoted posts. “Reddit drove eyeballs for us – we knew we wanted to accelerate the spikes in visibility (in particular with young Aussies), to run alongside our ‘always on’ activity. Reddit gave us far better access to the niche communities of people who were either highly knowledgeable or joined to learn more about our industry, resulting in half a million unique reach each time,” said Seb Neylan, Growth Marketing at Up. Our local Sales team is committed to helping Australian brands participate in best-in-class creative campaigns on Reddit. Here's what our partners have to say: \"Reddit provides a platform for businesses to engage and connect with consumers in an authentic way, and we look forward to working with them to connect with customers seeking to learn more about Dell. Congratulations for celebrating the first year in Australia,” said William Hasko, Market Lead for SMB, ANZ at Dell Technologies. \"Reddit offers an alternative in the social media marketing ecosystem that proved successful in driving brand results for our clients,” said Alice Isola, Head of Social, APAC, Essence. “While complementary to the wider media mix, Reddit provided highly engaged communities as an added value to the generally challenging, low-attention in-feed environment on social media platforms.\" Our Reddit users in Oz Australia’s communities are a hub for cultural conversations, with r/australia among the most popular in the region, accompanied by half a million Reddit users devoted to their city in r/melbourne. Die-hard sporting fans in r/AFL saw a 53% year-over-year increase in subscribers, while finance fanatics in r/fiaustralia saw a 73% year-over-year increase in subscribers. We also saw Aussie Reddit users highly engaged in election discourse through the 2022 Australian Federal Election in May. They were active in AMA® conversations with the Australian Electoral Commission about the voting process, and participated in over 40 AMAs with political party candidates in subreddits such as r/AustralianPolitics, with activity in the community growing over 200% over the last year. Local Reddit users also embraced connection and collaboration, claiming a stake in global efforts like r/place, where Australia was one of the top 10 most active countries in one of the world’s largest digital art projects.

In fact, we’ve seen a 34% increase year-over-year in conversations about UK travel destinations and holidays across Reddit. The community makes Reddit a go-to hub for holiday-goers to chat and share real and unfiltered recommendations. Redditors are able to engage with other like-minded staycationers and ask hard-hitting questions about their potential trips... is it dog friendly? … suitable for little ones? … travelling alone?...what’s the food scene like? Timed with the official summer holiday season, we’ve huddled with some of the leading travel resources and platforms in the UK, including Airbnb, English Heritage, Rough Guides, and Trainline, to share the ultimate guide for underrated summer travel spots. Whether people are itching to get off the beaten path, looking for short trips, or have an upcoming unplanned bank holiday to take advantage of, Reddit has them covered While a foreign, exotic holiday destination may often be the dream trip, if people know where to go, a UK staycation can offer just as much beauty, adventure, and luxury. And, it can often be the more sustainable choice as people can forgo flying and instead travel by train, bus or car – keeping their carbon footprints low and avoiding the hassle and stress that an airport often brings. From beachy vibes on the Welsh coast to a Highland hike, there’s something for everyone on our list. Based on conversations on Reddit, here are the best underrated staycation spots this summer as judged by Redditors - with some destinations also seeing search increases according to Airbnb [1]: Bedfordshire, England The Highlands, ScotlandOrkney Islands, ScotlandPembrokeshire, WalesGower Peninsula, WalesYorkshire EnglandLancashire, England [1] Airbnb data showing YoY % increase in searches for some Reddit trending destinations, comparing searches in Q1 2021 vs searches in Q1 2022 BEDFORDSHIRE, ENGLANDHappily Bedfordshire has more to offer than £1 flights to Magaluf via. Luton Airport. This Redditor shared a few scenic snaps from Wrest Park in the quaint village of Silsoe, Bedfordshire; a magnificent 19th century French chateau style house set in an outstanding restored landscape garden originating in the 17th century. According to their post, no matter their mood, they always feel more centred after a couple of hours wandering the grounds. Fun fact: Wrest Park’s grounds reflect three centuries of English garden design, including one of the few remaining early 18th century formal gardens.People are starting to catch on; the number of visitors to Wrest Park has increased by 12% since 2019, according to English Heritage, with 2021 being its best ever year yet [2]. Respectively, the latest statistics from Trainline shows that train travel to nearby Flitwick station has gone up by 174% this year[3]. So get there quick!

So much so that this redditor was surprised to see that the Lochniver beach they used to visit as a child looks the exact same all these years later. The signature combination of mountains, glens, lochs and rivers, surrounded on three sides by a magnificently pitted and rugged coastline, guarantees wonderful moody views. While you’re in the Highlands there try wild camping in the region - as this redditors puts it: ‘it doesn’t get much better than this!’. Fort William is gaining in interest -- having seen almost 130% increase in Airbnb searches over the past year [4]. In line with that, according to Trainline data, Fort William has seen a 146% in train passengers over the past year.

The Orkney islands are a unique and fiercely independent archipelago, and features in the Rough Guides reader survey as the most beautiful places in Scotland. In fact, according to data from Airbnb searches for the Orkney Islands have increased by over 120% in the last year[5]. This wild life enthusiast spent an entire week on the islands and was so chuffed they took 1600 pictures - you can take a look at some of their top snaps on Reddit. Doehouse Cottage, Sandwick, OrkneyOrkney, Scotland, United Kingdom www.airbnb.co.uk North Walls KirkOrkney, Scotland, United Kingdom www.airbnb.co.uk (image credit: ​​Inga Williamson) For an Orcadian, the Mainland means the largest island in Orkney rather than the rest of Scotland, and their history is inextricably linked with Scandinavia. If you’re into your ancient civilizations this redditor in particular is raring to pay a visit and explore early Christian and late Druidic sites up there. PEMBROKESHIRE, WALES. 'Who needs holidays abroad when Wales exists?' exclaims one redditor. The southern zigzag of the Pembrokeshire coast darts west from Tenby (one of the best holiday destinations in the UK according to this redditor) is a strange mix of caravan parks, Ministry of Defence shooting ranges, spectacularly beautiful bays and gull-covered cliffs. Insight from Trainline shows travel to the resort town has shot up by more than 50% [6].

The ancient town of Pembroke really only warrants a visit to its impressive castle and the fine Bishop’s Palace in neighbouring Lamphey. GOWER PENINSULA, WALES A fifteen-mile-long finger of undulating sandstone and limestone, Gower (Gŵyr) is a world of its own, pointing into the Bristol Channel to the west of Swansea. The winding lanes afford wonderful opportunities for exploration - in fact, not only will you find the most beautiful beaches in the world here, according to one redditor, but you’ll also find an up and coming to-die-for gastro scene; with a mix of traditional pubs and modern bars too. Hidden Gem - Cosy, Modern Cottage w/Log fire Gower, Swansea, United Kingdom www.airbnb.co.uk The entire peninsula is fringed by sweeping yellow bays and precipitous cliffs, with caves and blowholes to the south, and wide, flat marshes and cockle beds to the north. Bracken heaths dotted with prehistoric remains and tiny villages lie between, and there are numerous castle ruins and curious churches lurking about. YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND It’s easy to be glib about Yorkshire – to outsiders it’s the archetypal “up North” with all the clichés that implies, from flat caps to grim factories. For their part, many Yorkshire locals are happy to play up to these prejudices, while nursing a secret conviction that there really is no better place in the world to live. In some respects, it’s a world apart, its most distinctive characteristics – from the broad dialect to the breathtaking landscapes – derived from a long history of settlement, invention and independence. Make your way to the rural market town of Otley, just north of Leeds; the perfect spot for amazing views, dog friendly walking trails and pubs according to one redditor. Robin Hood's Bay Coastguard's Cottage with a ViewNorth Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom www.airbnb.co.uk If you find yourself in the south of the county stop by Roche Abbey - a 12th century now-ruined abbey situated in a valley landscaped by renowned gardener and landscape architect, ‘Capability Brown’ in the 18th century. The site has one of the most complete ground plans of any English monastery and the Gothic transepts still remain to their original height. One redditor was sizing up the location for an upcoming race, and was pleased he brought his camera along to capture the beautiful site… and they’re not the only ones! The abbey has seen somewhat of a resurgence this past year, reaching its highest levels of popularity since 2005 according to English Heritage. The closest train station is Conisborough, where the number of passengers has grown by 74% since 2021 [7].As for Yorkshire’s other boasts (the beer’s better, the air’s cleaner, the people are friendlier) – anyone who spends any time here will find it hard to argue with those. LANCASHIRE, ENGLAND The historical county of Lancashire reached industrial prominence in the nineteenth century primarily due to the cotton-mill towns around Manchester and the thriving port of Liverpool. Today, neither city is part of the county, and Lancashire’s oldest town, and major commercial and administrative centre, is Preston, though tourists are perhaps more inclined to linger in the charming towns and villages of the nearby Ribble Valley. *Charming Garden Pod* Couple/family with Hot tubForton, England, United Kingdom www.airbnb.co.uk Along the coast to the west and north of the major cities stretches a line of resorts – from Southport to Morecambe – which once formed the mainstay of the northern British holiday. Only Blackpool is really worth visiting for its own sake, a rip-roaring resort which has stayed at the top of its game by supplying undemanding entertainment with more panache than its neighbours. If you’re after a super non-obvious place these two redditors are gushing over the town of Ormskirk, for being the perfect central location to anywhere in the North West. Data from Trainline shows that the number of passengers travelling to the town have increased by 127% in the last year [8].

Shortly thereafter, we made countless accessories, outfits, and hairstyles available to allow for even more expression. We also brought redditors custom avatars in collaboration with partners like Netflix, Riot Games, and the Australian Football League (AFL). Seeing avatars take off got us thinking - what would happen if we gave artists on Reddit license to make any style of avatar they wanted? And what if we could help these artists showcase their art to the entire Reddit community and make it easy for them to earn money for their work? Our new Collectible Avatars storefront does just that. Collectible Avatars In this series, Collectible Avatars are limited-edition avatars made by independent artists, in partnership with Reddit, and provide owners with unique benefits on the Reddit platform. If someone sets their Collectible Avatar as their avatar on Reddit, they can mix-and-match the avatar gear with other Reddit avatar gear and accessories, and their profile image in comments sections will have a glow-like effect. Collectible Avatars differ from other avatars on Reddit in a few ways: They are available for purchase (vs. being free or available via Reddit Premium), and artists will be paid for each Collectible Avatar sold. Collectible Avatars are backed by blockchain technology, giving purchasers rights (a license) to use the art – on and off Reddit.You do not need cryptocurrency to purchase these avatars, nor are they being put up for auction. Each avatar has been priced at a fixed amount and is purchasable with fiat (government-issued) currencies. https://www.redditinc.com/assets/images/blog/TeaserVideo_Final.mp4 More on blockchain Right now, blockchain technology provides purchasers with ownership and portability of their Collectible Avatar, and provides artists with a way to have their work live beyond the virtual walls of Reddit (and be compensated for future sales of their art). Collectible Avatars are currently stored on Polygon, a general-purpose, Ethereum-compatible blockchain. We chose Polygon for its low cost transactions and sustainability commitments. In the future, we see blockchain as one way to bring more empowerment and independence to communities on Reddit. Reddit has always been a model for what decentralization could look like online; our communities are self-built and run, and as part of our mission to better empower our communities, we are exploring tools to help them be even more self-sustaining and self-governed. Blockchain-backed Collectible Avatars are one of the early steps we’re taking to test out the potential benefits of this concept on Reddit. How redditors can purchase Collectible Avatars Collectible Avatars will be available to everyone in the coming weeks, but today we’re allowing first-look early access to a limited number of redditors who join the r/CollectibleAvatars community. In that community, people can learn more about how to purchase Collectible Avatars, set up wallets to store them, and get to know our artists with behind-the-scenes posts, AMAs, and more. When available, people can purchase Collectible Avatars where they normally build avatars on Reddit, using local currencies, such as dollars in the U.S. As soon as someone completes a purchase, they’ll be able to use their avatar on Reddit. To store and manage Collectible Avatars, redditors will use their Vault – a blockchain-powered wallet on Reddit. A Vault gives users a specific digital wallet address that works across Ethereum-compatible blockchains; it’s the same Vault where redditors currently store Community Points. Empowering artists on Reddit Many of the artists we worked with for this first series came from popular creative communities like r/Comics. Some have cultivated the skills they utilized for this program in subreddits like r/ProCreate or r/AdobeIllustrator. We also worked with artists from our networks who are bringing their work to Reddit for the first time. From the start, our goal has been to empower artists to create and sell their work. Artists will get paid for every Collectible Avatar that sells on Reddit, less any fees, and are also entitled to receive royalties from secondary sales of their Collectible Avatars on open marketplaces. Aspiring artists interested in being featured in an upcoming release are encouraged to join our creator waitlist and keep sharing their skills and work with other redditors.

Though the month’s end is near, our celebrations are year-round. This is reflected in the theme selected by our LGBTQSnoo Employee Resource Group (ERG) this year: Pride 365. Creating opportunities for our employees that encourage community-building and education around Pride is a staple to bringing inclusion and belonging to everyone at Reddit. We spend 365 days of the year uplifting and supporting our communities, and during the month of June, our global workforce came together to enjoy special programming and activities for Pride. Each one of our offices around the world engaged in our company-wide “Celebrate Pride” campaign by spotlighting local employees who chose to share their personal experiences as members of the LGBQTIA+ community. The campaign also encompassed important moments of open dialogue and spaces where employees could connect and delve into hard topics in the spirit of vulnerability and intersectionality. Each Reddit office facilitated different Pride activations including games with local drag queens and celebratory meals for employees to gather and come together IRL. Festivities continued as Reddit’s LGBTQSnoo ERG organized live musical sessions with singer-songwriter and vocalist, WATA, and dialed the fun up with a fierce and entertaining workout with Hyperbody Fitness for all of our employees. Our LGBTQSnoo ERG also hosted a meaningful panel discussion that focused on queer families and featured guests from the ERG as well as drag chanteuse and LGBTQIA+ activist, Bebe Sweetbriar, and our very own COO, Jen Wong, who was recently recognized on Fast Company’s third annual Queer 50 list of LGBTQ women and nonbinary innovators in business and tech. Ensuring that all of our employees can connect with each other and find a home at Reddit is critical to our mission of bringing community, belonging, and empowerment to everyone in the world. Our north star also extends to our platform of over 50 million daily active uniques. Reddit’s values-based platform fosters LGBTQIA+ communities that provide a safe space where users can seek support, advice, and encouragement on issues that are most relevant to their everyday lives and can embrace their authentic selves. Support from others is critical in supporting oneself, and 41% of redditors* use the platform to get advice from others who are open with empathy and transparent about their personal journeys and experiences; which is critical for folx in the LGBTQIA+ community who are navigating their gender and identities. We will continue to provide a place for our employees at Reddit and users across our platform for support, validation, and education when connecting over these shared experiences. *Source: Reddit Internal Data Insights LGBTQSnoo (founded in 2021): Our vision is to foster a workplace where queer identities are continuously valued and celebrated. Our mission is to provide spaces and opportunities for LGBTQ+ employees at Reddit to socialize and express themselves.

ARIES: MARCH 20 - APRIL 19 Symbolized by the ram, Aries represents Cardinal Fire and is ruled by Mars. When Mercury is ruled by Mars, it makes a native that is action-orientated, assertive, and driven in communication and learning. Mercury in Aries natives should check out r/changemyview where they can jump head first into debate over whether politicians should have to advertise their donors like NASCAR drivers or if cruise ships are bad. TAURUS: APRIL 19 - MAY 20 Taurus is the sign of Fixed Earth. Ruled by Venus, those with Mercury in Taurus appreciate calm and soothing settings to keep their minds relaxed. That’s why r/cozyplaces is the place for this sign – with its never-ending stream of beautiful images of comfortable places where a Taurus Mercury can imagine themselves staying put and escaping the world. GEMINI: MAY 20 - JUNE 21 Mutable Air is what defines the sign of Gemini. With Mercury itself as the ruler, this sign is naturally sociable, flexible, and irreverent. Mercury really shines in this placement and will love to joke around and make witty observations in r/me_irl. CANCER: JUNE 21 - JULY 22 Ruled by and in tune with the emotional moon, Cancer is the sign of Cardinal Water. When Mercury is in Cancer, it has incredible empathy and adeptness at communicating emotion. That’s why r/emotionalsupport is the perfect haunt for those with this placement. The Cancer Mercury natives can put their natural talents into practice as a shoulder to cry on for their fellow internet strangers. LEO: JULY 22 - AUGUST 22 Fiery and fixed, Leo is ruled by the sun, and the sun loves nothing more than to shine. When Mercury lives in the sign, the native will thrive in the spotlight and be a natural public speaker. Spend some time as the center of attention in r/AMA, where Leo don’t have to be an actual celebrity to have their fifteen minutes of fame. VIRGO: AUGUST 22 - SEPTEMBER 22 Another Mercury ruled sign, Virgo, represents Mutable Earth. Logical, practical, and systematic, but not afraid of change, Virgo Mercury natives know how to organize time, space and information. Their attention to detail, work ethic, and structured lifestyle make r/organization a must-be-bookmarked community for this star sign. Here, Virgo can share suggestions on what to do with their space and workplace centre to help keep their hub happy and humming. LIBRA: SEPTEMBER 22 - OCTOBER 23 The combination of style and judgment are perfect for those with Mercury in Libra. Libra, ruled by Venus, knows what’s beautiful, and when Mercury resides here, they won’t hesitate to share. The sign’s Cardinal Air qualities mean it leads the way in new fashion concepts. In r/malefashionadvice and r/femalefashionadvice, Libra can put their natural gifts to use helping others be as on point as they are. SCORPIO: OCTOBER 23 - NOVEMBER 22 Because of their listening skills and ability to keep secrets, Scorpio is often considered one of the more mysterious signs. Fixed Water and ruled by Mars, they understand emotions but can handle the darker side of life; which is why r/confessions is the go-to place for Scorpio Mercury natives. In r/confessions, redditors share their secrets, unfiltered opinions, and gossip. These natives will be enthralled by the humorous and outrageous stories ranging from still being in love with an old friend after 3 years to knowing shocking family secrets. SAGITTARIUS: NOVEMBER 22 - DECEMBER 21 Ruled by Jupiter and representing Mutable Fire, Sagittarius stands out! When Mercury is here, this star sign is loud and proud and not afraid to share their opinion, no matter what anyone else thinks. These natives will feel right at home in r/unpopularopinion where they will tell you that you aren’t as smart as you think you are and that vanilla doesn’t get the credit it deserves. CAPRICORN: DECEMBER 21 - JANUARY 20Responsible and practical are two words that perfectly describe this Saturn-ruled Cardinal Earth sign. Those with Mercury in Capricorn are old souls who start talking about their 401k while still in pre-K. They will thrive on giving and getting tips and tricks on early retirement over in r/financialindependence. AQUARIUS: JANUARY 19 - FEBRUARY 18Another Saturn-ruled sign, Aquarius uses its Fixed Air energy to cross boundaries rather than erect them. With Mercury here, the native will be inspired by the innovation and technology in r/futurology. Shamelessly revolutionary, Aquarius Mercury natives can explore out-of-this-world content such as the retro but all-electric Ford pick-up, new methods to break down plastic in days, how 1.8M Australians were provided power by wind and solar for six and a half days, and so much more. PISCES: FEBRUARY 18 - MARCH 20 Pisces is Mutable Water and ruled by Jupiter. When Mercury lives here, the native is especially creative, receptive, and open to new experiences. These natives are often gifted artists, and their dreamy nature is perfect for r/art, a space where they can express their creativity and imagination. This community is an online museum of content – home to different types of art including the viral Moniz image and the intricate and mesmerizing Fibonacci."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-acquires-machine-learning-platform-spell","date":"2022-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Reddit Acquires Machine-Learning Platform Spell","text":"Reddit’s mission is to bring community, belonging, and empowerment to everyone in the world, and one of the ways we do this is by connecting people to the topics, interests, and passions they care about the most.

Mental health support is especially important at Reddit where our core mission is anchored around empowering community and remembering the human. Raising Awareness and Empowering Others Throughout the month of May, Reddit’s People & Culture team alongside our Ability employee resource group (ERG) developed valuable programming for employees to engage in mental health-related conversations, find supportive resources, and build support systems with colleagues. Devoting time to learn and discuss mental or behavioral health problems opens up the opportunity for understanding and gives people the ability to talk openly about their struggles. The Ability ERG promoted this by creating a workshop geared towards equipping employees with helpful strategies to support others who may need help. They also launched a Mindful Minutes Challenge through a self-care app that employees have free subscriptions and 24/7 access to for better sleep, reduced anxiety, and improved focus. Supporting mental health online is just as essential, which is why we offer a variety of different initiatives and assistance on Reddit’s platform. To educate and bring awareness to mental health issues, we’ve announced a special Ask Me Anything (AMA) series with academics and health experts. Participants confirmed at the time of writing (with more to be added) include: professor Patricia Deldin in r/IAMA on Thursday, May 19th, for Mental Health Action Day. For those seeking additional information and support for themselves or others, Mental Health Awareness Network provides helpful online resources, and we’ve also offered our volunteer Reddit moderators a one-year prepaid subscription to a self-care app to promote mindfulness and reduce stress. Finding Your Workplace Balance Reddit’s benefits are thoughtfully designed to support the health and safety of our employees. With our flexible-first workforce model, existing and future employees are empowered to manage their work in a way that is most effective and flexible for them. Employees are encouraged to create work boundaries that help them stay healthy, sane, and productive, which may take the form of blocking time on calendars or taking advantage of Reddit’s volunteer benefit which provides 8 work hours a month to dedicate to volunteer work. They can also use their yearly Workplace stipend to fund at-home workspace expenses (e.g. desk, chair) that they may need to be successful in their environment. Our entire global workforce can also unplug, reset, and enjoy personal time in a way that’s most meaningful to them during our monthly Global Wellness Days. In addition, all Reddit employees have access to a mental health service which includes 12 paid coaching or therapy sessions per year with a licensed professional. All the programs and experiences created for our employees are a reflection of our Company Values and are meant to foster diverse needs. We continue to evolve our workplace with a sustainable approach that supports all employees as unique individuals, small teams, whole departments, interest groups, and as an entire company. Ability: We are a space of belonging for Reddit employees with disabilities and neurodiversity. We raise awareness of disabilities and neurodiversity by planning awareness events, being visible, and celebrating accessibility within Reddit.

As our communities reflect on the past year since the signing of COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, the public demonstrations that were reignited have paved the way for heightened awareness for Stop AAPI Hate and opened up a space for communities to share their experiences. Our greatest power is our voice. In the spirit of continuing conversation with Reddit’s Employee Resource Group (ERG) Reddit Asian Network (RAN) and beyond, we introduce this year’s AAPI month theme: Renewing & Rebuilding the Community. We recognize the importance of laying an even stronger foundation for the future in order to rebuild the community into a better normal. With that goal in mind, members of RAN created three pillars to build a deeper sense of community and belonging amongst Reddit employees: Programming & Events: Celebrate key cultural events to strengthen connection and inclusion through engaging activations and cross-functional collaboration within the global Reddit community. Community: Introduce sub-communities to recognize the diversity within the broader Asian culture, deepen belonging, and increase relevance and engagement within RAN through monthly touchpoints, in-person get-togethers, and water cooler chats.Development & Advocacy: Develop programming aimed at personal and professional development and advocacy through networking events, speaker series, mentorship opportunities, and mental health or self-care moments. To bring together RAN and celebrate AAPI Heritage Month, a few events have been organized throughout the month: Crazy Funny Asians: This comedy event will feature Asian American comedians from across the nation bringing light-hearted humor to the forefront of serious conversations. In the midst of Renewing & Rebuilding, there is also an important opportunity to take time to heal. And we’ve heard that laughter is the best medicine. Humans of RAN Launch & Debut: Think humans of New York but with a twist - a spotlight on Reddit employees that are members of RAN. We’ll be hearing about the experiences of our employees across the Asian diaspora to celebrate our differences and dispel the myth of the Asian monolith. RAN Exec Panel: We are proud of our executives that are of AAPI heritage and we want to take time to celebrate them and learn more about their journeys. It’s also Mental Health Awareness Month so we’ll be creating space for a discussion on the importance of prioritizing mental health on their road to being senior leaders. As we kick-off events this week, a special thank you to RAN for planning a month packed with programming for AAPI Heritage Month and to all employees at Reddit for participating in important discussions and celebrating each other’s cultures and communities.

People come together to do surprising, incredible, and inspiring things. For the past six months, Reddit has been experimenting with a program called Community Funds to help Reddit community ideas and passions come to life with financial support. Through our experiment, we funded 13 projects that communities nominated. Projects have included a comics tournament, a community-designed musical artist billboard in Times Square, and a digital conference for history buffs. We want to foster more opportunities for connection by making Community Funds official, with $1 million in funding. Community Funds aligns with our mission of bringing community, belonging, and empowerment to everyone in the world. We believe that empowering communities to do more by awarding funds to support their best ideas is one way we can accomplish this. “Sometimes it just takes a little boost to make a great idea come to life, and we want to help communities find that support,” said Laura Nestler, Reddit Vice President of Community. Beginning in June, we will invite communities to submit ideas for projects, events, contests, giving, almost anything you can think of to bring people together for inspiration and delight. We will be accepting nominations for projects needing anywhere from $1,000 to $50,000 in funding, and selecting grantees based on their creativity, feasibility, and community impact. Until then, we will be building out more submission details and guidelines.

Over the last year, we’ve been steadily improving and updating our search experiences to support the millions of posts, communities, and people that make up the platform, helping people find and engage in the topics that matter most to them. Today, we’re announcing a number of new updates to Reddit’s search capabilities to make our vast platform of content more easily searchable, starting first with the ability to search comments. With this latest update, for the first time in sixteen years everything on Reddit is now searchable - users, posts, communities, and now comments - making Reddit one of the first platforms with this capability. Additional new features include completely new user interfaces for search and improved search relevance. Comment Search With this new capability, users looking for particular discussions or comments on Reddit no longer need to click on several posts and then scroll through what can sometimes be thousands of comments to find threads that are relevant to them. The new feature solves this problem and quickly gives redditors the ability to comment search directly and further refine their searches by searching for comments within specific communities. For example - if someone wants to find a thread about the best locations in London, previously they would have to look through each post in the r/London community, browsing the comments to find it. Now, they can easily see all the different recommendations on the best places for high tea that people have shared in comments. Last year, we surveyed users asking what they wanted to see most out of search, and one of the top results was comment search. In our limited initial testing, we saw that more than 26,000 redditors used comment search to scan through over five billion comments. New User Experiences and Interfaces We’ve also been hard at work creating a new look for the search results page on desktop and mobile – showing content in a new, simpler design. Based on user feedback we now prioritize posts over other content types in our updated search design and simplified the results page so users can more easily skim through the results and find what they’re looking for. The team is also working to make search safer for all users by reducing the number of unexpected results based on the searcher’s intent. In Q1 of 2022 alone, we've seen a 20% growth increase up from Q4 2021 in users utilizing the search function on Reddit, signaling our continued improvements are helping redditors quickly and easily find what they're looking for. Improved Search Relevance and More Improving relevance in search has been another core area of focus. To make search a better experience, we updated our infrastructure and focused on: Allowing for less restrictive matching - 100% of a query doesn’t have to match the text of a post to return relevant results. By doing this we saw a 60% increase in results for queries that previously didn’t receive results. For example, let’s say someone searches for “dogecoin stonks 2021,” and doesn't find what they’re looking for because there isn't an exact match; with our new treatment, they’re more likely to get related results (and more of them) than they would have before. Using user patterns to improve results - we now have a better understanding of user intentions when they search for something on Reddit. For example, if someone is searching for a topic that a lot of other people are searching for, we'll automatically sort their results to prioritize the newest content to make sure the results are fresh. Incorporating signals for post results - this enhancement looks at users’ clicks and interactions on search results as a ‘signal’ of what might be valuable for them. For example, if 30 other people clicked on the fourth post result when they searched for “succulents'', the next time someone else searched for “succulents,” we are more likely to show the fourth post at the top position in results. Check Out All the New Updates The ability to comment search is rolling out today on desktop. This feature, along with the other updates, can be accessed by heading to the home feed and clicking within the search bar, and conduct a search.

We added some improvements this year such as putting in more colors to the color palette and expanding the canvas each day to see how communities would interact and collaborate on it, which led to one of the most engaging moments we’ve ever seen on the platform.

Our achievements from the past year include building out a team of over 60 employees that are dedicated to creating a sense of community and belonging for Redditors in Canada. We’ve built a meaningful presence in the country – and we’re just getting started. Building out our Canadian workforce In the 12 months since opening our Toronto office, the workforce has also significantly grown its local team comprised of Product, Engineering, Community, and Sales teams. The hiring growth doesn’t stop there as Reddit continues to hire for sales and multiple front-end and back-end engineering roles. As RJ Pauloski, Country Manager for Canada, noted: “Canadians are continuing to find communities and dive deeper into their interests on Reddit. Now, we are able to serve users in our country with more nuance and resources to create meaningful experiences based on the topics and conversations most valuable to them. Our commercial presence and current slate of brand partners are strong and we are excited to scale further by growing our user base and creating unique consumer touchpoints for Redditors on and off the platform in 2022 and beyond.” Canadians and brands alike find their home on Reddit With a highly engaged audience, it’s no wonder so many Canadians are finding their home within Reddit’s community of communities. Local Canadian subreddits like r/vancouver, r/toronto and r/ottawa are just some of the thriving places Canadians visit to find information pertaining to their everyday lives and be part of a community that’s meaningful to them. It’s also a place where businesses in Canada are finding their voice – and the ability to access distinctive communities to propel their business objectives. “Canada serves as a powerful opportunity to support our internationalisation efforts. Over the last year we’ve seen success and we’re continuing to work with brands that want to reach communities on Reddit to meet their business goals,” said Tariq Mahmoud, Reddit’s Head of International. Brands like Mitsubishi, Dapper Labs, Questrade and Microsoft are also continuing to find success in reaching passionate online communities delivering positive results. When it came to Wealthsimple, Canada’s only commission-free trading platform, their strategy was not only to reach users within business and finance communities but also to expand their audience using run-of-site targeting to gain better efficiencies across the board. By testing one of Reddit’s newest ad products, Conversation Placements, they tapped into users already discussing finance on Reddit, resulting in 33% of installs becoming Canadian Wealthsimple Trade clients. “Advertising on Reddit helps us reach new and existing customers where they’re at. We’re able to help beginners get into personal finance when they’re at that info-seeking stage by providing supplemental educational information, and ultimately the tools they need to be successful in investing at a lower cost than big banks,” said Cedric Hulin, Wealthsimple’s Director of Acquisition. “Not only that, Reddit is a great tool for learning what questions people have about personal finance, and what they think of Wealthsimple. Reddit has been instrumental in our growth in both 2020 and 2021, and we look forward to working together in the future.” Reddit users in the Great White North Country-specific communities have seen the most growth, with r/PersonalFinanceCanada increasing by 34%, and was the fastest-growing community among Canadian users in 2021. It also warms our hearts to see other fast-growing subreddits in Canada: people are finding friendships IRL via r/Vancouver4Friends and others are creating and finding local goodies and hidden gems on r/BuyCanadian.

So on April 1, we’re launching its comeback and showcasing the magic of online communities, conversation, and collaboration. When we first ran r/place in 2017, more than one million redditors placed approximately 16 million tiles on a blank communal digital canvas - resulting in a collective digital art piece. Every year since then, users have asked us to bring it back. It was hands down one of our most popular April Fools' Day experiences. The community asked; we answered. With an improved platform, international expansion, and a user base of more than 50 million daily active uniques and over 100,000 communities, r/place is back. https://www.redditinc.com/assets/images/blog/A1_Trailer.mp4 How r/place Works To participate, redditors can tap or click on the new widget icon with the letter “P” at the top of the home feed, or open their community drawer in their app and tap on it. Once people navigate to r/place, they’ll see a communal 1000x1000 tile canvas where (logged in) redditors can place a tile or pixel of their color choice (once every 5 minutes by tapping or clicking anywhere on the canvas). People who are logged out of Reddit can view the canvas unfolding in real-time, but can’t place a tile. r/place will be available across Reddit and via our apps for 87 hours, ending on April 4 at 9:00 pm PT. The r/place Widget at the Top Right of the Home feed (far left) and the UI of Choosing a Tile on r/place History of April Fools' Day on Reddit We’ve always taken a different path and used April Fools' Day as an opportunity to test new ideas and systems and connect with users – this year is no different. r/place was created and brought back to explore a piece of humanity – to examine what happens when a person doing something affects a collective. Specifically, what happens if you only let an individual place one tile at a time, so that they must work with others to build together on a massive online cooperative canvas. “We learned from the original experiment that people online are naturally collaborative, that redditors are more creative than we are, and that Reddit is a place where great things blossom,” said Alex Le, EVP Strategy and Special Projects at Reddit. “April Fools' Day on Reddit has a history of inspiring how we build new features on the platform. From Robin inspiring our real-time chat product to Circle of Trust inspiring real-time comment and upvote counts, April Fools' Day provides Reddit a period to test infrastructure at a grand scale and try things that are new and off the wall. We look forward to seeing what collaboration happens on r/place this year and learning how we can better our platform.” The Ending Art Piece of r/Place from 2017 For more details about Reddit or our features, you can check out our help center."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-wpp-announce-multi-year-commerce-advisory-partnership","date":"2022-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Partnerships"],"title":"Reddit and WPP Announce Multi-Year Commerce Advisory Partnership","text":"To help brands better leverage the purchase power of online communities, we’re excited to today announce a long-term consultative partnership with the world’s largest marketing communications company, WPP. The partnership, a first of its kind for Reddit, led by our global Agency Development team, will strengthen Reddit’s on and off-platform commerce offering by closely aligning with WPP’s industry-leading commerce roadmap. About the Partnership The partnership will tap into the commerce and technology expertise across WPP and its media agencies within GroupM through quarterly advisory meetings. Teams will consult on Reddit’s commerce strategy, ensuring it incorporates the latest insights and intelligence from across the WPP network. WPP will receive a first look at Reddit’s commerce solutions with early access to alpha and beta tests so both companies can collaborate on joint products to take to shared clients. The joint partnership will also include a joint research piece, to test the effectiveness of future commerce products on Reddit, along with a training program through Reddit Ads Formula, which soft-launched last year. Building on our existing partnership with WPP media arm, GroupM, who was one of the very first to meet with Reddit’s Ads Product team when it was first introduced, this partnership will widen the aperture of Reddit’s relationship with WPP and help inform Reddit’s long term commerce strategy, firmly cementing its role in the wider commerce mix. “Online communities are not new but they have emerged throughout the pandemic as an integral part of the commerce mix thanks to the highly influential role they play in the consumer path to purchase,” said Reddit Global EVP and President of Advertising, Harold Klaje. “I am excited to further strengthen our relationship with WPP and its suite of clients as we continue to collaborate and build together, tapping into the holding company’s impressive expertise and working towards mutually beneficial outcomes for our advertising partners.” Mutually Beneficial Many WPP client brands already working with Reddit to drive commerce solutions through Reddit’s highly engaged user base and 100,000+ communities. WPP was also an instrumental part of Reddit’s Product Council, which launched last year as a first-look and feedback session for key partners regarding Reddit’s evolving ads product roadmap. This new partnership will see Reddit and WPP continue to collaborate on client campaigns with a particular focus on lower-funnel education, strategy, and tactics to drive the strongest purchase outcomes. “Being a part of the Reddit Product Council in the past year has given us a seat at the table in terms of early product design, leading to better aligned product development and advertiser interest. The partnership brings key stakeholders in early enough to steer concepts rather than confirm formed hypothesis,” said GroupM VP, Managing Partner, Global Head of Social, Amanda Grant. “GroupM and WPP are approaching commerce evolution much more methodically with our partners, as our performance expertise helps to connect user behaviors, to platform utility, and finally advertiser need. We are looking forward to richer contributions and partnership with Reddit.“ We’re Just Getting Started The partnership comes as we continue to grow Reddit’s Global Agency Development team, which has recently appointed London-based Susanne Schmid who joins from Facebook where she was Regional Agency Lead and will serve as Reddit’s Global Agency Lead for WPP. Additionally, former VP, Global Head of Partnerships at Verizon Media, John Baylon has also joined the team as Regional Agency Lead, EMEA, and will be responsible for servicing all holding companies across EMEA in a newly-developed role.

We’re spotlighting our inspiring women employees through a global lens during March and have intentionally created more programming and events to bring everyone together regardless of their location. As we reflect on the tributes of women by women, we have anchored several activities around this year’s theme for Women’s History Month designated by the National Women’s History Alliance: “Women Providing Healing, Promoting Health.” Several of our women-focused employee resource groups (ERGs) including WomEng, Women in Product, and Women of Reddit, collaborated in bringing this month of celebration (and beyond) to life with interactive events. These activities range from mentoring sessions with fellow employees to collaborating on solving each other's career challenges to life coaching lessons that provide tools to help map our careers and achieve our goals. We’re also hosting sessions on life empowerment topics including a financial literacy workshop on how to take mindful actions towards cultivating wealth, as well as toasting to success during mixology classes across all of our locations. In addition to all of the global activities taking place, several of our local offices have created plans as well. Our London workforce is hosting a special local event with industry guests to discuss the topic of resilience – how have women and allies coped with trauma and how can we learn from them to use tough times to grow and flourish. There will also be an open panel session with guest speakers followed by a lunch catered by women-owned businesses. In addition, we will commemorate the month with a celebration across Reddit’s EMEA workforce to connect, speak on topics closest to our women employees, and share experiences that have shaped personal and professional journeys. More about our women ERGs: WomEng (founded 2017): Women Eng aims to advocate for women engineers at Reddit and foster a greater sense of community amongst them.

Recognizing that this is first and foremost a human tragedy, we have been working to ensure that those in our community and colleagues who are impacted by these events have the support that they need during this difficult time. We wanted to take this opportunity to share with you some of the steps that we are taking in that regard, understanding that this is a quickly evolving situation and we will continue to reevaluate and adjust our response as the changing situation may warrant. We are in active contact with our moderators and communities—particularly those most affected by the conflict—to provide support, resources, and specialized tooling so they can continue to function without interference. We have a process to escalate moderator requests and reports related to the Ukraine situation so that our team can quickly review and act upon them. In addition to these support measures, we have calibrated our automated safety systems and are providing daily guidance to our community and safety team members to ensure that we are not incorrectly removing important and newsworthy citizen journalism that might otherwise be mistaken for rule-breaking content. We have been working diligently behind the scenes to shore up our site-wide defenses. We stood up a cross-functional team to monitor and respond to developments in real time, assisted by Russian and Ukrainian speakers. We are in regular contact with peer companies and government stakeholders to anticipate issues that might appear on Reddit, and we are working to limit the exposure of communities with questionable moderation practices, including through Quarantine, and removing moderators acting in bad faith. We also see time and again that coordinated disinformation attempts struggle to take hold on Reddit because—in addition to our detection systems—our deeply-engaged moderators and users quickly remove, downvote, and challenge misleading content. While many communities on Reddit already prohibited links to Russian state media outlets like RT, Sputnik, and their foreign language affiliates, we have made such restrictions universal across the site in all geographies. Furthermore, we will continue not to accept advertisements that target Russia or originate from any Russia-based entity, government or private. We are also assisting affected Reddit colleagues in Ukraine, including providing advanced income payments and housing allowances and supporting their relocation. This is a live situation, and our response is evolving every day as we gain new information. The measures above are not a complete or final list of what we’re doing, but we hope it provides some insight into our efforts right now. Reddit, at its core, is about community, and we will continue to do whatever we can to ensure that our platform remains available for people to connect, support each other, access reliable information, and express their authentic opinions and feelings during this difficult time."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/celebrating-black-history-month","date":"2022-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Life at Reddit"],"title":"Celebrating Black History Month","text":"Since its inception in 1926 as Negro History Week and later its extension in 1976 to a month-long celebration, Black History Month has served as a pivotal moment where all Americans can reflect on the many contributions that the Black community has and continues to contribute to society. Each year, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History selects a theme for the month. This year, the theme is Health and Wellness. In alignment with the theme, our Black People Reddit (BPR) employee resource group has been intentional in making health and wellness a priority through all of our celebrations with our employees this month. Elevating Black Voices and Conversations BPR leaned into this annual observance in an engaging and purposeful way with curated content and programming for employees including “Soul Symphony,” which provided a forum for mindfulness through meditation and sound therapy, and “Chicken Soup for the Black Soul,” a space where Black employees at Reddit came together to discuss the challenges and triumphs that define the Black community. BPR also arranged an interactive panel focused on “Black Identity in Corporate,” which brought together Black professionals across multiple industries for an important conversation around navigating how we show up as Black people in the workplace, regardless of function. The activities continued with a “Real Talk Series” where employees connected with Black executives from other organizations to have honest and candid conversations about their paths to success and learnings along the way. We also had the distinguished opportunity to host poet Dr. Nikki Giovanni for a fireside chat where she read from her collection of poetry in Make Me Rain including “Ego Tripping,\" \"Vegetable Soup,\" \"But Some of Us Stayed,” and \"Physics.” We also heard her unfiltered reflections of the past, thoughts about celebrating the present, and visions about the promises of the future. All of these events and programs are important initiatives that help celebrate Black culture while also providing meaningful impact for our employees throughout their everyday lives. Enriching Reddit’s Employee Experience At Reddit, we are committed to supporting our Black employees year-round through various benefits and partnerships. We work with organizations such as the Valence Community, which is a community of Black tech professionals offering mentorship and educational opportunities. We also have a comprehensive Learning & Development department and offer all of our employees an annual professional development stipend to use towards sharpening skills and helping our underrepresented groups identify impactful external workshops to participate in. We also uphold an extensive University Recruiting strategy in which we recruit from minority-led student groups with the schools that we have traditionally recruited from alongside HBCUs. We’re constantly exploring new ways to bring more community and belonging to our employees, and it's all building towards making sure our company reflects the diversity of our communities, on Reddit and in real life. Black People Reddit (BPR) (founded in 2017): BPR’s goal is to create a forum where BPR members are seen, heard, and celebrated via the three pillars of recruiting, retention, and allyship. By cultivating a positive experience for all Black employees, working to expand Reddit’s presence, capabilities, and opportunities to put diverse talent in front of hiring managers, and creating partnerships to grow Black talent within the Black community, we are actively celebrating the skill and contributions our members bring to the broader Reddit family."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/introducing-our-discover-tab-a-new-way-to-use-reddit-and-find-more-communities","date":"2022-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product & Design"],"title":"Introducing Our Discover Tab – A New Way to Find Content, Conversations, and Communities on Reddit","text":"At Reddit, we’re always looking for ways to help people find more communities and make it easier to discover new content. Part of this is listening to feedback and acting on it to bring community, belonging, and empowerment to everyone. Redditors told us they want an easier way to explore current and new interests, so today, we are rolling out our first new surface in nearly two years – the Discover Tab. This new navigational tool provides redditors with an engaging way to more easily find content and communities across Reddit. During initial testing, we saw one in five people join at least one new community after using the Discover Tab. “We’re ushering in a new era of discovery on Reddit, with images and video top of mind,” said Jason Costa, Director of Product for Content and Communities at Reddit. “We’re making discovering relevant content and communities more intuitive with the Discover Tab. It’s a great new way for people to explore and engage with hundreds of thousands of communities around the world.” How Discover Tab Works We’re able to tailor each redditor’s Discover Tab to surface what we think they’ll enjoy the most. What we show is based on communities they’re already a part of as well as time spent. For example, if a redditor subscribes to and spends a significant amount of time in football and baseball subs, Discover Tab will prompt them with other sports-related content. To access the Discover Tab, redditors can tap on the new compass icon on the bottom bar – to the right of the home button. At the top of Discover Tab, redditors can filter the feed to a specific topic to find new content and communities. Underneath the topic filters is the feed where content is shown. To ensure that the feed improves over time, we’ve added feedback mechanisms that allow people to select: show me more of this content, show me less of that content, and hide that content. From houseplants and pickling at home, to Golden Globe moments and Dungeons and Dragons memes, the new feed brings a rich variety of content to the forefront in a visually appealing way, and makes it simple to engage and enjoy spending more time on Reddit. New Community and Profile Drawers Once you discover and join new communities, how do you keep them organized in the app? To solve this, we’re introducing new Community and Profile Drawers to make it easier for redditors to prioritize the communities they care about most. Community DrawersBy tapping the drop-down menu at the top left on the home screen, redditors can get to their communities and custom feeds faster than before. The Community Drawer is divided into four sections: “Moderating entry points” in which moderators can see their mod feed, mod queue, and the subreddits they moderate.“Your communities” where the communities redditors subscribe to can be sorted and customized;“Following” which shows redditor accounts a user follows;The “r/all” entry point Profile DrawersWe’re also introducing a Profile Drawer where redditors can access their profile and customize it on the fly by swiping left or tapping on their profile icon at the top right of the home screen.

They shape how we stay connected with one another, how we show up to work every day, and help navigate important daily decision-making. These core principles are bolstered by our Community Values, which inform how we develop our product, policies, and community relationships. From building new features that enhance existing products to sharing insights about content moderation, our Community Values are embedded across multiple facets of how we support and engage with our users. These values will only become more important as we continue to provide an online space for more people to interact and connect with one another. Both sets of our values have existed within Reddit long before they were written down, and steer us toward our mission of bringing community, belonging, and empowerment to everyone. Sharing these values with the world captures our ethos of community and transparency, while also giving a deeper understanding of what we believe is important about Reddit. They are a reflection of our company and platform, and also exist as an aspiration for what we work toward every day alongside our users. Reddit would not be Reddit without our community. Remember the Human We believe Reddit is the most human place on the internet. It’s powered by the creativity, passion, and generosity of the people who spend time here and make it their own. We respect redditors and work hard to give them a place where self-expression can thrive and communities can achieve amazing things together. We also remember that there are real people on the other side of the screen who lead full and complex lives. And often, when someone is struggling or in need of support, they come to Reddit to find help and understanding they can’t find elsewhere. We take this role seriously and aim to make Reddit a place where people can continue to find communities that accept and appreciate them for who they are. Empower Communities Reddit succeeds when our communities succeed. When we build anything on Reddit, we start with community—evaluating ideas by how well they empower communities. Reddit has evolved by decentralizing control and empowering communities to create the spaces that work for them—spaces that have become some of the most selfless, ingenuitive, funny, and enriching communities on the internet. We trust communities to know what works best for them and give them the autonomy to make decisions for themselves. Keep Reddit Real Reddit is where people can be genuine. The humans of Reddit are a vast and diverse group of people, who come to the platform as their full, imperfect, human selves. Sometimes this results in the type of candid, honest discussions you can’t have anywhere else; other times it results in the type of communities you find on r/wowthissubexists. We present an authentic, unmanicured version of the world, and as long as being your unfiltered self isn’t hurting anyone or violating the Content Policy, then there’s a place for you on Reddit. We don’t understand or agree with everything on Reddit (we’re a vast and diverse group of people, too), and we don’t try to conform Reddit to what we or other people think it should be. We do, though, try to create a space that is as real, complex, and wonderful as the world itself. Privacy is a Right Reddit stands for privacy. Redditors have complete control of their identity and are empowered to share as much or as little personal information as they want. Redditors don’t reveal information about each other without permission, and Reddit Inc. doesn’t use nonpublic information about redditors without their consent. To use Reddit, you’ll never have to surrender your privacy or pay us with your data or information. We also let people know and control how we use their data. We run ads, and use what people agree to share with us to show them ads we think they might be interested in (and yes, to make money) but we don’t and won’t ever sell redditors’ information. Believe in the Good Reddit reflects humanity. When people on Reddit come together around something they really care about, they can and will do extraordinary things. In our interactions, we try to give each other the benefit of the doubt and remember that most people—even when upset, frustrated, or misguided—are decent and reasonable, and will do the right thing given the right circumstances. Believing in the good does not mean disbelieving the bad. There will always be redditors (and people everywhere) who are nasty or just outright horrible at times. But if that was how all redditors were, the platform and its culture wouldn’t be what it is today. The overwhelming majority of people come to Reddit because they genuinely want to contribute and feel a sense of belonging. If that's not happening, something is wrong and we’ll fix it. People are good, and if we empower them, the good will always outshine the bad."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/adding-new-features-to-reddit-talk-recording-function-web-experiences-comments-and-emojis-and-live-bar","date":"2022-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product & Design"],"title":"Adding New Features to Reddit Talk: Recording Function, Web Experiences, Comments and Emojis, and Live Bar","text":"Last year, we introduced Reddit Talk to empower moderators to host live audio conversations in their communities. And, in the last three months, we've seen more than 250% growth in daily active listeners of Reddit Talk. We’ve also seen Talks enabled in more than 1,000 subreddits and take place in some of our most popular communities, including a r/cryptocurrency Reddit Talk featuring Kevin O’Leary, a r/movies Reddit Talk with Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, and Paul Scheer, a r/space Reddit Talk with Chris Hadfield, as well as community Talks in r/wallstreetbets, r/dadjokes, and r/relationship_advice. Building on these successes, today we’re rolling out a number of new features for Reddit Talk, including: a recording function so community members can listen to Reddit Talks after they’ve happened, bringing the Reddit Talk experience to web users, the ability to interact with text and emojis during Talks, and a live bar experiment on the top of the feed that shows when live Reddit Talks are happening. Recordings If redditors can’t make it to a live Talk, we want to make it easy to listen to past Talks on their own time. Starting today, when a redditor visits a Reddit Talk post from a past live session, they will be able to listen to a recording of the conversation. The new feature includes a playback bar that enables redditors to skip to any timestamp, pause or unpause, and fast-forward or rewind 10 seconds at a time. Web Experiences We’re also bringing Reddit Talk features previously reserved for our native app to web users. Now, anyone can listen to Talks and raise their hands to speak and moderators can mute speakers and remove them from the stage when using Reddit.com. Creating talks on desktop is coming later this month. Comments and Emojis Redditors can now use text and emojis to actively participate in a Talk. Previously, redditors who were listening to a Talk were able to raise their hand to join the stage, but couldn’t comment in real time. Enabling comments and emojis makes Talks easier to engage with, even without speaking. Live Bar We heard from Redditors that it was hard to find live audio talks in their favorite communities. So starting today, we are testing a live bar at the top of home feeds that highlights what Reddit Talks are happening, making it easier for redditors to discover Reddit Talks in the communities they love.

Communities celebrate this holiday in many different ways, but it has historically served as an annual family gathering for those who commemorate the special occasion. Although many of us may be physically apart from our family and friends, we are brought closer by our love and care for each other (and with a little help from technology). Based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar, the shared foundation for Lunar New Year across many Asian cultures, 2022 is the Year of the Tiger. The tiger is traditionally associated with courage and strength in many cultures, making it an apt symbol for the Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community as we enter the third year of the COVID pandemic. Our courage is not only shown through resilience in the face of adversity but also in our openness and vulnerability in seeking and giving help. AAPI community members continue to thrive around the world, and with our traditional wishes of good fortune and good health, we bring that fortitude into this new year. At Reddit, the employee resource group (ERG) Reddit Asian Network (RAN) continues to recognize, cultivate, and support the AAPI employee community in many different ways. To celebrate this Lunar New Year, RAN created educational and cultural experiences for Reddit employees including sending virtual Red Envelopes with lucky fortunes and sharing restaurant guides to support Asian-owned local restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, London, Dublin, and more. There will also be special programming and events for employees throughout the month featuring senior leadership at Reddit and notable figures from the AAPI community. Additionally, to share the goodwill of the Lunar New Year with the Reddit community, we have also released Lunar New Year-themed Snoovatars so that users can spread cheer and celebrate the holiday in their favorite communities. In 2022, RAN and other ERGs at Reddit will continue to create shared experiences and explore new ways to bring more community and belonging to employees and our community. Thank you to our employees for their generous donation of time to help make this Lunar New Year at Reddit a joyous and memorable one.

These principles exist as a touchstone for employees as they learn and progress throughout their career journey at Reddit and to also evaluate potential employees while scaling our global workforce. As we continue to grow and strengthen our company culture, we want to share our values broadly with the world to provide more transparency into how we work towards our mission together. We strive to build a company and platform that people are excited and passionate to be part of. Reddit’s Mission First Our mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. As we move towards this goal with different initiatives from different parts of the org, it's important to remember that we're in this together with one shared goal above all others. Make Something People Love Our surest path to success is to make something people love. Evolve Only by continually improving and learning will we succeed. Add Value We constantly evaluate our work to ensure it’s adding value and bringing us closer to achieving our mission. It’s easy to fall into the trap of conflating activity with value. Adding value requires hard work, but not all hard work is valuable. Default Open The free flow of ideas and feedback is the lifeblood of a healthy organization, and Reddit must embrace it if we are to thrive."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/introducing-new-members-to-our-executive-leadership-team","date":"2021-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Introducing New Members to Our Executive Leadership Team","text":"We are thrilled to announce four key additions to Reddit’s executive leadership team: Carla H.

In our newly renamed Reddit Recap 2021, we take a deep dive into the moments and communities that inspired redditors to be catalysts for change both online and in the real world. This past year, Reddit became the place where people felt empowered and inspired to share their opinions, experiences, and stories and connect with one another to take action and positively impact their communities. As a company, our continued global expansion opened up Reddit to more and more people. We announced new offices in Canada, Australia, and Germany, reaching new redditors around the globe. We aired our first-ever, 5-second Super Bowl ad (or as we call it, Superb Owl). We shipped new features -- Reddit Talk, Predictions, and CryptoSnoos -- that gave redditors more ways to connect and engage with each other. As we look back at what took place on Reddit during 2021, we’re reminded that some traditions are worth keeping around. That is why Community Reflections has returned. This year’s reflections capture the thoughts of moderators and redditors from some of our biggest communities such as r/antiwork, and those behind some of the most inspiring moments, such as the young boy who was gifted more than 150 stuffed Manta Ray toys. Community members share their experiences, reactions, and reasons why Reddit brings people together “one sh*tpost at a time.” (Thank you, u/WildfireSmile, for that very on-brand quote). Let’s take a look at all that happened on Reddit this past year. By the Numbers: Reddit is home to more than 100,000 active communities around the world;In 2021, redditors created 366 million posts, a 19% increase YoY; As of November 9, 2021, we’ve seen 2.3 billion total comments, a 12% increase YoY, and 46 billion total upvotes, a 1% increase YoY.

Whether it was searching for new fitness routines or sharing new diets, redditors found comradery in popular communities such as r/progresspics and r/loseit. By the numbers: The top-five most viewed communities of the year were r/lifeprotips, r/sports, r/progresspics, r/fitness, and r/loseit; andAmong the top-five most viewed communities of 2021, r/progresspics and r/loseit saw the most growth in subscribers with r/progresspics increasing 29% and r/loseit increasing 19% in the last year.

This past year, redditors rallied around movie and TV communities to share news about green lit sequels, reveal their theories on the future of movie and TV franchises, and obsess over streaming hits. Among the highest-viewed of the platform’s movie and TV communities are The MCU’s (Marvel Cinematic Universe) releases, hit shows (i.e. Squid Game), and legendary reality TV shows that never seem to end (*cue RuPaul’s Drag Race’s “Shantay, you stay!”). By the numbers: The top-five, most viewed movie communities were r/movies, r/marvelstudios, r/starwars, r/moviedetails, and r/dc_cinematic; andThe top-five, most viewed TV communities were r/marvelstudios, r/thebachelor, r/prequelmemes, r/rupaulsdragrace, and r/television. For the Squid Game fans -- do you still look at traffic lights the same? Well, let’s dive into the Korean thriller that captivated audiences. Throughout the week of the show’s September premier, r/squidgame saw an increase of 2.5K% members. In fewer than two months, September 17–November 9, the community grew to 125K members. 2021 was also a huge moment for the MCU and its fandoms. r/marveltheories increased 1.1K% in views YoY, and r/gotg increased 958% in views YoY.

And Henry Cavill, of course, was delighted to do so (44.4K upvotes) Around the World We can’t wrap up without talking about all the new places where Reddit opened its doors in 2021. With our continued expansion—in the UK, Canada, Australia, and Germany—Reddit has grown to include people living in different countries, cities, and towns across the world. Among all that happened across Reddit in 2021, whether in the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, or Germany, finance-related communities were among the most viewed communities across every geography. United Kingdom Throughout the past year, UK redditors came to Reddit because that’s where finance conversations were happening. In 2021, r/ukpersonalfinance, a community where UK redditors can “discuss, learn and request help on how to obtain, budget, protect, save and invest [their] money,” had a 75% increase in views. Here, redditors warned one another about sophisticated bank scams, discussed HSBC’s decision to allow homeless people to open bank accounts, and debated the question “should we be more open about our salaries?” As a community, r/ukpersonalfinance was more than a place to discuss numbers, it was a place where redditors were able to ask thousands of questions and get real-life, applicable answers. In 2021, two other popular UK communities (both of which were featured in our London Calling: One Year On report) were r/askuk and r/casualuk -- places where UK (and non-UK) redditors can go to complain about the metric system and confuse the crap out of Americans. Over the last year, while r/casualuk grew by 43% in views, r/askuk increased 70% in views showing that many people have a lot of unanswered questions about the UK and its citizens. Canada In 2021, similar to other geographies, Canadian redditors were most interested in finance, more specifically, r/personalfinancecanada. Over the past year, this community increased in views by 34% and became a space where redditors mulled over topics such as the obstacles in Canadian housing, the increase in minimum wage, and local economics. The second highest viewed community was r/vancouver, a more localized Canadian community, which grew 30% in views YoY. Here, Vancouver residents discussed anything and everything. Whether it was a quippy sign to those refusing to wear masks, a video warning others to be cognizant while walking alone, or a photo from a redditor sketching pedestrians while sitting at a local coffee shop, this community became a dedicated place for Vancouver-based Canadians to talk about things happening in their area.Australia For Australian redditors, while finance was still a hot topic -- r/ausstocks increased 94% in views YoY and r/fiaustralia increased 83% -- COVID-19 related restrictions drove Aussies to r/coronavirusdownunder, which had a 175% increase in views from last year. In this community, redditors discussed intense, albeit important, topics including the recent protests and various lockdown restrictions. But, amidst all of the chaos and frustration that came with the implications of coronavirus, Aussie redditors still found a way to have a laugh (even if it was unironic). Whether Australians were in search of ways to track and manage stocks or make memes apologizing to one another, they did it together.Germany Among German communities, finance ranked high as one of the top two contenders for most-viewed communities in 2021; specifically r/finanzen, which had a 193% increase in views YoY. Similar to redditors in other geographies, German redditors were sarcastic (but accurate) in their complaints about the housing market, that trying to save without money is quite challenging, and the reality and feasibility of work-life balance is debatable. However, amidst German redditors’ financial conversations, they wanted more than a place to crunch numbers, so they turned to r/ich_iel, a community where the home feed is 99% photos and sarcastic memes, and, over the last year, had a 210% increase in views. Here, German redditors also poked some fun at Americans, were able to laugh at themselves, and agreed upon the cultural staple that there are only two types of glasses in German households. Congratulations, you made it to the end of Reddit Recap 2021! From the stock market whirlwind, to the uplifting stories in which strangers came together, to global expansion, and moments that mattered, we saw redditors create moments that extended beyond their online communities into the real world.

These are all new ways for redditors to interact and engage with the platform and over 100,000 active Reddit communities. Voting and Comment Count Animations Votes on content are now non-static numbers in feeds and on posts, and animate as the vote counts go up or down in real-time. Similarly, comment count animations receive the same treatment in feeds and on posts; going up as more comments on posts are shared in real-time. A gif of Reddit’s new voting animation Typing and Reading Indicators New typing indicators show when two or more redditors are typing to comment within posts. Typing redditors are shown via anonymized avatars near comment windows. In a similar fashion, reading indicators note when five or more redditors are reading a post by displaying grouped anonymous avatars in a pill at the top of comment sections in posts. A preview of Reddit’s new reading indicator A sneak peak at Reddit’s new typing indicator New Comment Pill Redditors will now be able to see when new comments are being submitted (when they are viewing a post). When a redditor clicks on the new comment indicator, the comments will sort by new and highlight live comments in real-time.

This year in particular, redditors had a massive impact on each other’s lives. In this year’s Community Reflections, we explore various communities and moments that left a mark on 2021 including r/antiwork’s community growth, the r/wallstreetbets movement, redditor-driven URL to IRL moments, and r/nosleep’s rise to Hollywood fame. Here, moderators and members of these communities share their thoughts on the Reddit experiences that affected their lives beyond the platform. r/antiwork Becomes the Poster Child for The Great Resignation COVID-19 flipped the workplace upside-down. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this past August, 4.9 million Americans (2.9% of the entire workforce) quit their jobs. The lingering effects of COVID-19 continue to impact those who no longer want to abide by the standard 9:00–5:00 workday with poor treatment from bosses and low pay for excessive hours of work. From 2020 to 2021, the r/antiwork community grew by +279% members and has already surpassed 1,000,000. u/abolishwork, one of the early moderators to join the r/antiwork team, commented, “A lot of people say r/antiwork helped give them a sense of community and a place to see their value is not only tied to work.” The Rise of the ‘Apes’ (also the animal) Keeps Going...and Hasn’t Stopped In late January, 2021, r/wallstreetbets took the stock market by storm. Overnight, GameStop’s stock soared, bringing retail investors to the forefront of the market conversation. The community grew by +606% members YoY and spurred the ‘meme stocks’ movement. The consistent conversation around r/wallstreetbets also led to massive growth in cryptocurrency discussion. Cryptocurrency communities, such as r/dogecoin, dominated, and more and more new redditors came to the platform to find a place to talk about financial markets. “The r/wallstreetbets community is special because everyone experiences the same, very real emotional rollercoaster you are. The billboards, the planes, the tattoos -- all these things really brought r/wsb from a niche online community into the physical world,” said the r/wallstreetbets moderator team. But the r/wallstreetbets community didn’t stop there. They went a step further and got involved in the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, donating more than $200,000; and in October, a new networking platform commissioned a 7-ft tall Harambe statue as a commentary on today’s traditional investing structure, which was placed in Wall Street’s famous Bowling Green Park. In response, Reddit’s ‘underdog darlings’ emphatically celebrated the ode to Harambe, commenting, “Knowing my money ended up being used building this makes me smile.” In their own words, “the team that runs this community is a talented, diverse group of rocket scientists, lawyers, recruiters, Wendy’s drive-through operators, med school students, coders, artists, and finance nerds. Reddit gives us a sense of togetherness. It’s kind of comforting to learn that so many experiences were shared.” Redditors Who Made Everyone Say “That’s Amazing” In June, u/memon17, posted in r/MaliciousCompliance stating “HOA won’t let us fly our modest Pride flag, so we just follow the rules” (91.8K upvotes). TL;DR -- in May 2021, a neighborhood HOA declared that residents could only fly the U.S. flag outside their homes. A day later, this redditor received a notice that a neighbor had reported their Pride flag (even though it had been flying for years). They begrudgingly complied but also found a loophole — there weren’t restrictions on removable lights; so u/memon17 decided to buy lights that flooded their house in Pride colors -- a “little less subtle than [the] simple flag.” Overnight, the post went viral. u/memon17’s post is still the most upvoted post in r/MaliciousCompliance. The post, and the overwhelming support from other redditors, caught the attention of many news outlets including CNN, USA Today, and more. To this day, u/memon17 said they “still get an award or two each week.” Beyond the awards, redditors showed how they come together to positively impact one another’s lives. One redditor, u/WildfireSmile, posted in r/povertyfinance that due to financial hardship, they were unable to buy their son a toy for his birthday. Instead, they repurposed their son’s baby blanket and hand-stitched a stuffed Manta Ray (67.9K upvotes). Well, other redditors wanted to celebrate this boy’s birthday with an even bigger surprise, so they mailed him more than 150 stuffed Manta Ray toys (44.5K upvotes). “I did not expect my post to get so many views,” said u/WildfireSmile. “The responses were very humbling -- having all of these people come together to make my son feel seen and loved, it brought joy back into his life.” Others came across u/WildfireSmile’s story and also helped the family. An internet stranger, who later connected with u/WildfireSmile, gifted the family a trip to the zoo, which included a Manta Ray feeding and petting experience. This person also started a GoFundMe page to help raise money for the family as u/WildfireSmile homeschools their four children. To date, the fundraiser has surpassed $43,000 -- more than $40,000 over the initial goal of $2,500. The blessings for the family continued as u/WildfireSmile gifted a portion of their donation money to the Oklahoma Children’s Hospital, which led the hospital to create the Manta Ray Giving Project, a website where individuals can donate to the hospital and gift a sick child a stuffed animal or provide families with gas cards so they can travel to and from the hospital. The joys didn’t stop there. In the massive, 34 million member r/AskReddit community, one redditor posed the question, “What is something you’ve done purely out of the goodness of your heart but have never told anyone?” u/dartdoug commented that they donate to One Simple Wish (33.2K upvotes), an organization that helps foster kids and provides them with something they may not normally receive. “One Simple Wish’s mission hit home with me. My thoughts went to the kids who are shuffled from home to home; so I found a wish on the website, and I did something I hope made a child’s birthday a bit brighter,” said u/dartdoug. Well, the comment gained traction and redditors flocked to the One Simple Wish site, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars and ultimately crashing the site because of the overwhelming amount of online traffic. u/dartdoug commented, “The response floored me. My eyes well up every time I tell the story. I was hoping that word about One Simple Wish would spread, and I have to say it definitely did.” Some redditors go beyond the URL to spread their message IRL, such as u/iLoveLootBoxes, a Canadian redditor who dresses in a costume and live streams their charity runs. When asked about the costume, u/iLoveLootBoxes commented, “I wear the costume because it makes people who have not seen me before wonder why I am wearing it. When they realize it is for charity, it seems to make sense to them. If I ran without the costume, my audience would instead consist of people interested in the running and what times I post.” This redditor, who is the creator of the OrcRun community, has raised more than $16,000 CAD for various charity causes -- cancer research, heart disease, and more, and has witnessed redditors engage in their runs in real time, donating upwards of $2,000 CAD in a matter of two hours. As u/iLoveLootBoxes continues to do charity runs and sees redditors more actively donate, they say they’re at the point “where it feels wrong to stop.” On the opposite side of the globe, an Australian redditor struggled to find available COVID-19 vaccines. As the Delta variant spread, redditor, u/handshakerefuser, created a solution -- COVID Queue, a website that will ‘ding’ Aussies when vaccines become available in their local area. In its initial stage, the website aggregated open appointments in Sydney; however, as redditors found the site helpful, they requested that the site expand outside of the Sydney area to include other portions of Australia. u/handshakerefuser’s COVID Queue has expanded to include Victoria, Melbourne, and the Newcastle/Hunter region. In r/nosleep, Hollywood Finds Writers in an Unlikely Place Last year, traditional television and film witnessed a decline. Studios halted production, movie releases were pushed, and writers lost their jobs. But for some, they found a safe haven on Reddit and gained so much attention that the rights to their stories were picked up by streaming giants. “In r/nosleep, redditors support each other; they cheer one another on and help one another,” said u/cmd102, a moderator of the community. “It’s a big family. We’ve seen people go from writing for fun to writing books and signing movie deals. It has been a growing force.” Redditor, u/Polterkites, got a major start on Reddit. u/Polterkites posted their first of a series story in September 2020. Fast forward to June 2021, and Netflix grabbed up the screen rights to produce u/Polterkites’ We Used to Live Here, which will feature Blake Lively as the main character (NBD). “2020 was a very tough time in my life, but I turned to r/nosleep after a six-year break,'' said u/Polterkites. \"After I wrote ‘We Used to Live Here’, two producers reached out to me, and eventually, I sold the story. All of it has been a complete shock -- I almost thought I was being pranked -- but nothing compares to how meaningful the support from the r/nosleep community was to me during that time.” There’s also u/VatoCabron’s My Wife and I Bought a Ranch (picked up by Netflix), which got the author a publishing deal, as well as an OG r/nosleep, ‘creepypasta’ redditor, who went on to be part of the script-writing team for the streaming hit, The Haunting of Hill House. On a platform with more than 100,000 communities, redditors never stop finding ways to support one another, create waves that change the world, and experience moments that leave an impact on their lives. Whether it be for humor, advice, or support, Reddit is a place where people find comradery and conversation where internet strangers never stop showing up for one another."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-more-of-dubsmash-to-reddit-by-launching-new-video-features","date":"2021-10-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product & Design"],"title":"Bringing More of Dubsmash to Reddit by Launching New Video Features","text":"Late last year, we welcomed Dubsmash to the Reddit family. As a short-form video social platform, Dubsmash built a fun and engaging platform that enabled their users to create unique, dynamic, and interactive content. Combining forces has been a perfect match. Reddit is where passionate communities come together for timely, interactive, and authentic exchanges about topics that matter to them, and video is increasingly core to how people want to connect. To date this year (January 2021 to November 2021), video content has soared on Reddit. We’ve seen: Nearly 70% growth in overall hours watched.More than 30% increase in daily active video viewers growth. And, we’ve seen a 50% increase in quarter-over-quarter short (less than than 2 seconds) video viewership in our new video player. Since joining, the Dubsmash team has been working to integrate their innovative video creation tools into Reddit -- with a goal of empowering Reddit’s own creators to express themselves in original ways that are authentic to our communities. In line with completing this integration, February 22, 2022 will be Dubsmash’s last day as a platform. After February 2022, Dubsmash will no longer be available for download in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store; currently downloaded apps will stop functioning on the same date. The Dubsmash team has been accelerating Reddit’s video, so parts of Reddit will feel familiar to Dubsmashers. Dubsmashers can continue connecting with each other at r/dubsmash and hop over to Reddit to discover an endless stream of new creators and communities -- like r/dance, r/nextf*ckinglevel, and r/pan -- that match their many interests and talents. And, to add even more video functionality to Reddit, today we’re starting to roll out new video creation tools. New Camera Say cheese! New features include the ability to: Change recording speedSet a timerUpload videos in landscape, portrait mode, and fillAdjust and trim multiple clipsUse new Reddit-first lenses to meme yourself as Bread Cat or make yourself a Snoo.

Reddit Is Coming to Germany","text":"Millions of German users flock to Reddit every day to find community and belonging with those who share similar interests, and with 47% user growth year-over-year, Germany is now home to our fifth-largest user base. Today, we’re officially saying “hallo” to our friends in the heart of Europe and opening our doors in Berlin with a dedicated team on the ground. Hot off the heels of our recent expansions to Australia in July and Canada in March of this year, Germany is the next step in our international expansion strategy and marks a key milestone in Reddit’s commitment to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. “Our launch in Germany is the first step in a long-term commitment to the market and expansion beyond English-speaking countries,” said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman. “We’re excited to build out our local workforce, grow more German communities, and enable German advertisers to connect with our users.” Our team on the ground Our Berlin-based team currently spans Community, Sales, Ops, Product, and Engineering, and will be led by a locally-based General Manager who will be appointed in the coming months. The team is managed by Reddit’s Head of International, Tariq Mahmoud, is set to grow by more than 150% by the end of this year, and is already partnering with local entities, working with German-based moderators and communities, and establishing local advertiser partnerships. Our German Sales team sits within our global Sales org under the leadership of Reddit’s EVP and President of Global Advertising, Harold Klaje. Reddit users in Germany Globally, Reddit’s 100,000+ communities unite people around an endless array of topics and interests. It’s home to the most real and passionate exchanges on the internet with topics ranging from cooking to cryptocurrency, pets to parenting, and everything in between. In Germany, Reddit users spend an average of 27 minutes per day on the platform -- which is more time than they spend on Snap, Twitter or Pinterest -- and share similar interests to our global audience but with clear local nuance. From sharing funny encounters in r/wasletztepreis to seeking out budgeting advice in r/finanzen, and learning about planting flowers or vegetables in r/garten, German Reddit users are true meme junkies but also discuss serious topics like finance with an equal amount of fervor. Communities like r/de, which has 500,000 members and is a catch-all resource for any and all German-related content, sit alongside the likes of r/mauerstrassenwetten, which was created as a local German equivalent of the popular global community, r/wallstreetbets -- so it’s clear German users on Reddit have a diverse range of interests. German millennials are particularly well represented on Reddit at 38%, closely followed by Gen Z at 35%, while 23% of the local community belong to Gen X, and 4% are Baby Boomers. Each month, they contribute a total of 151 million posts, comments, and votes on the platform. German brands finding their home on Reddit The real and passionate user experience that is cultivated across Reddit is unmatched, and Reddit users in Germany are unduplicated in that they can’t be found anywhere else online. In Germany, 38% of Reddit users are not on Twitter, while 37% are not on Facebook, and 25% are not on Instagram. Global and German advertisers like Intel, Qualcomm, HP, Amazon, Apple, Aktien.news, and Deutsche Telekom are among those already working with our Sales team to engage with German Reddit users and local communities. “The German advertising market is significant to our global Sales strategy and a key part of our international growth plan. While we have been fortunate to enjoy steady organic growth in the country and have seen this attract advertisers in Germany, Reddit’s official market entry will accelerate our existing momentum in a more focused way,” said Reddit Global President and EVP of Advertising, Harold Klaje. “Reddit is home to more than 100,000 communities which means there is a place for every kind of brand and advertiser on the platform, and I am looking forward to seeing more German brands discover this as our local Sales team continues to scale.” Our German Sales team is committed to helping local brands understand the value of Reddit and our unique community of communities, and to setting German advertisers up for long-term success on the platform. The team will work closely with our global Sales organization to ensure international best practices and a best-in-class offering for German clients. Reddit’s German office is located in Mitte, Berlin, and is officially open for business.

From building out our team on the ground and scaling our local user base, to significantly growing our active advertisers, we’ve solidified a meaningful presence in the country and are just getting started. We mark this milestone today with a look at our in-market momentum, the announcement of Reddit’s new UK General Manager, our very first UK marketing campaign, and so much more. Success to date Reddit launched in the UK in 2020 with an already-strong local advertiser base that has continued to scale at pace thanks to our dedicated regional team. Invoiced ad revenue for the UK and EMEA has increased by more than 250% year over year, and our active advertisers in the region have increased by 55% year over year. “We launched our UK business in the middle of a global pandemic – a risky move in itself – but we believed in the strength of our UK community and the value it could bring to local brands and advertisers with dedicated, highly focused tools, teams and resources on the ground,” said Reddit Global EVP and President of Advertising, Harold Klaje. “One year on, all of the leading indicators of growth are all trending positively: we’re seeing increases in active advertisers, close rates are up, deal sizes are increasing and our partnerships are evolving into long-lasting relationships. This success is a testament to our UK audience, which is growing at pace and bringing local nuance to the platform, and of course to our UK team that continues to demonstrate its wide array of strengths.” Our UK workforce, which is made up of Sales, Community, Product, Media Partnerships, Marketing, and Engineering teams has increased by more than 6x since launch, and we’re working to increase our local headcount by 50% by the end of next year. UK brands find their home on Reddit With a highly engaged audience that can’t be found anywhere else online¹, and home to the most authentic conversations on the internet, it’s no wonder so many UK brands are finding their place within Reddit’s community of communities. Brands like Octopus Energy, Bitstamp, Huel, Capcom and Ooni join global household names including Amazon, Dell, Playstation, Intel, Adobe, Samsung and HP as just some of the advertisers activating campaigns to reach and engage with Reddit’s UK audience. The UK Government was one of the first advertisers to join the platform following our market launch, and has been running consistent public health and safety initiatives, ranging from how to socialize safely during the pandemic to advice for getting tested and vaccinated, ever since. Black, female-owned small business Afrocenchix has recently been working with Reddit to promote its all-natural hair care line and grow its business in the UK, running top-of-funnel ads as a cost-effective way to target new customers. “Afrocenchix prides itself on remaining a community-driven brand despite operating in the fast-paced, growth stage of our business. Reddit users are passionate, invested and already talking about hair care, making our decision to build out our presence on the platform a no-brainer,” said Afrocenchix Co-Founder, Rachael Corson. “We have been able to connect with new audiences, who have in turn become loyal customers, by targeting communities where interest was already baked-in. This has allowed us to join the conversation naturally, share information about our products and provide a real value to people who are interested and want to learn more.” Similarly, when eBay wanted to promote its new sneaker authentication service to UK users, it went straight to the heart of the most passionate online conversation: to Reddit communities like r/sneakers and r/yeezys to reach people where they were most engaged. “We wanted to not only raise awareness of eBay’s new sneaker authentication service in the UK, we also needed to instill confidence among passionate sneaker fans about the program’s effectiveness. Reddit users are among the most engaged and influential audiences on the internet and we knew investing in these spaces would drive significant consideration,” said eBay UK Social Lead, Mary Cleary. “ We targeted a diverse range of communities within the platform’s style, fashion and sports interest groups via a mix of promoted video and Reddit’s new ad surface, Conversation Placement which allowed us to show up in a culturally and contextually relevant way, which has driven meaningful results for us.” Introducing Laurelle Potter At the helm of our UK business is newly appointed General Manager Laurelle Potter, who joins Reddit from Tinder where she served as Marketing Director. With over a decade of experience joining companies in their early growth stages – including her former role as Marketing Director at Snap, where she led the EMEA launch of Spectacles – Laurelle is tasked with leading Reddit’s UK team and setting the overall strategic direction for the country. Her early priorities will include continuing to build out our local communities and user base with a focus on marketing and partnerships, as well as help to scale Reddit’s Ads business and attracting more local brands to the platform. “I’ve enjoyed a long career in marketing and tech, but my passion lies in working for community-driven brands that enable people to connect with one another. Reddit is the home of community, and I look forward to using my years of experience in fostering intimate connections to deliver this on a larger scale, helping to propel Reddit’s mission of bringing community and belonging to all,” said Reddit UK General Manager, Laurelle Potter. “Reddit weaves together the best of what social platforms have to offer, and there is a huge opportunity to ensure people in the UK understand its value and benefits. I am so excited to share the Reddit story and help bring its magic to life so that individuals and brands in the UK see what I see.” Laurelle joins Reddit in October. When she’s not working, you’ll find her deep in her favorite Reddit communities including r/casualUK, r/roomporn and r/skincareaddictionUK. Reddit users in the UK The UK continues to be home to our second largest user base and is growing steadily at 48% year over year. Reddit users in the UK spend an average of 31 minutes on the platform each day, and like most of our users globally, our UK audience brings a wide variety of passions and interests to the platform every day. Country-specific communities have seen the most rapid growth in membership since our launch, with r/askuk increasing by +97% and r/casualuk increasing by +36% to 861,000 members. r/Olympics was the fastest growing community among UK users in 2021, while conversations around beloved reality TV shows also accounted for rapid growth in communities like r/loveislandtv and r/loveisblindonnetflix. Video gaming, life advice, entertainment, national news, gaming, travel and dating interest groups are some of the most popular among UK Reddit users, with cryptocurrency, personal finance, interiors and landscape, and beauty emerging as our fastest growing communities for 2021. Diving into our first brand marketing campaign To celebrate our one year milestone, we are thrilled to today unveil our first ever UK brand marketing campaign, “Maybe Together We’ll”, which is now live throughout London and will appear across high profile out-of-home placements including at Waterloo Station and Westfield London Shopping Centre, as well as within 26 tube stations around central London, and street postings across several neighbourhoods. It will also be live on digital channels, over-the-top video and addressable TV. In partnership with our agency R/GA, “Maybe Together We’ll” is designed to showcase the depth and breadth of Reddit’s communities, including our thousands of thriving UK communities, and inspire more people to dive into the platform. “Community is always at the heart of our marketing efforts and our first campaign in London is no different, though this is the first time we’re showcasing local UK communities at such scale,” said Reddit Chief Marketing Officer, Roxy Young. “Maybe Together We’ll” is a celebration of Reddit’s passionate online communities and aims to serve as a reminder that anything can happen when people unite around things they care about. We hope it will encourage more people in the UK to dive into our platform and find their community.” From spotlights across a wide range of our communities to a mash-up of the diverse user generated content in the campaign’s hero film, we’re bringing to life the heartwarming and hilarious interactions that make Reddit so special, all through the lens of our UK user base. https://www.redditinc.com/assets/images/blog/Reddit_MaybeTogether_UK_60-1-1.mp4 For more information and to learn more about reaching our UK audience, please contact us. 23% of Reddit users in the UK are not on Facebook, 39% are not on Instagram, 47% are not on Twitter, 61% are not on TikTok, 75% are not on Snapchat and 64% are not on Pinterest -- Comscore, June 2021."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/introducing-michelle-reynolds-chief-accounting-officer","date":"2021-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Introducing Michelle Reynolds, Reddit’s Chief Accounting Officer","text":"We are delighted to announce that Reddit appointed its first Chief Accounting Officer.

Today, we are excited to announce the launch of our latest advertiser offering, Conversation Placement, which allows brands to leverage the unique power of Reddit by reaching users where they are most engaged in their passions and interests. The Conversation Placement sits within a conversation thread, under the original post, and above the first comment, giving advertisers the opportunity to scale reach beyond Reddit feeds and connect with users where they are the most leaned-in. The new placement type has a proven track record for advertiser success thanks to extensive beta testing, especially when coupled with Reddit’s in-feed advertising. Reddit’s Most Engaging Ad Placement Community conversations are the heartland of Reddit, where the most engaged exchanges take place across a wide variety of passions and interests, every day. Conversation Placement allows advertisers to connect with their audiences as these exchanges are unfolding, and it works in collaboration with Reddit’s in-feed advertising to reach even more users where they’re most leaned-in. What’s more, the placement drives a deeper audience connection and contextual richness, as it allows advertisers to show up in discussions relevant to their campaigns. “Reddit users thrive on conversations and are highly engaged in unique dialogues around their passions. Conversation Placement is an opportunity for all Reddit advertisers to drive engagement on the platform, positioning themselves right where people are connecting with one another, in a way they can’t on any other platform,” said Reddit Global EVP and President of Advertising, Harold Klaje. “This launch is an outcome of our close and continued collaboration with Reddit advertisers to ensure solutions that tap into what makes Reddit special. It’s the latest example of our Ads business continuing to meet the needs of advertisers. We’ve invested a lot in the past year to evolve our product offering to ensure brands can best leverage the power and value of Reddit, and creating opportunities for advertisers to meaningfully engage with users is key to delivering on this.”Why Conversation Placement? In addition to driving a deeper audience connection, Reddit advertisers can also drive incremental reach through Conversation Placement. Reddit ads have never before appeared in conversation threads, allowing advertisers to expand the reach of their campaigns and speak to a new, untapped audience, many of which land in conversation threads directly from SEO searches and are unreachable anywhere else on the platform. What’s more, when combined with Home, Popular, or Community Feed placements, advertisers can drive higher performance with Conversation Placement as well as more cost-effective campaign outcomes. Advertisers who target both the Reddit Feed and Conversations Placement can reach millions more unique users than when targeting with a single placement, increasing their overall reach by up to 20%. Conversation Placement offers all of the same foundational brand safety features regardless of inventory type, with Oracle Data Cloud’s contextual intelligence applicable to the placement via our Limited Inventory tier. Reddit Advertiser Success Reddit has beta-tested Conversation Placement with more than 600 advertising partners for almost 12 months, running campaigns across entertainment, consumer tech, finance, publishing, and CPG, resulting in significant success for partners across all industries, verticals, and campaign objectives. In aggregate, beta test partners saw a 9% average increase in clickthrough rate (CTR), 10% higher downstream conversion rate (CVR), and 23% lower Cost Per Click (CPC) rate when using both Conversation placement and Feed. Test partners have included HBO Max, Adobe, Monday.com, The Washington Post, and Nespresso. Adobe has been leveraging the Conversation Placement for their evergreen campaign to reach students since Q4 2020. Targeting a wide range of student and creator related interest groups, Adobe worked with Reddit’s KarmaLab team to ensure compelling and engaging creative for their placement in conversations happening in communities such as r/photoshopbattles, r/gradschool, and r/applyingtocollege, which combined with in-feed creative has resulted in an average increase in CTR of 20% and a 25% decrease in CPC compared to an in-feed post alone. HBO Max, one of the first Reddit advertisers to run Conversation Placement, has seen similar success with more cost-effective campaign outcomes. “At HBO Max, our fans inform every decision we make, and we want to reach them where they live. We use a blend of arts and science – coupling data with human insights – to attract new audiences and create personalized, entertaining experiences for every fan,” said Laura Lee, VP, Acquisition & Growth Marketing at HBO Max. “It’s vital that we have tools at our disposal that allow us to target based on passions like entertainment, sports, and gaming. Reddit’s Conversation Placement not only let us target based on passion, but also allowed us to join relevant conversations that are already happening. As a result, we have continued to not only meet but exceed our growth goals.” Cloud-based work project management software company Monday.com has also leveraged Conversation Placement for its performance-focused campaigns with the goal of driving quality sign-ups for user product licenses. “Our campaigns on Reddit are focused on reaching the maximum number of people to encourage quality sign-ups for our product,” said Monday.com User Acquisition Manager, Sara Amati. “Conversation Placement has driven our most efficient sign-ups to date, allowing us to target national news, technology, business and finance interest groups across the U.S., Canada, UK, and Australia via static and video assets in a contextually relevant way.” Conversation Placement is available to all Reddit advertisers from today.

To help fulfill our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world, Australia is core to our international growth strategy. This launch follows Reddit’s successful market entries in Canada in March 2021 and the United Kingdom in September 2020. Our new Australian team launches with dedicated, locally-based Community, Engineering and Sales staff, as well as Country Manager, David Ray, who will join us in the coming weeks from WooliesX, and has experience leading teams in Australia for Amazon, Twitter and Telstra. The Australian business is managed by Reddit’s Head of International, Tariq Mahmoud, and is already partnering with local entities, working with Australian-based moderators and communities, and establishing local brand partnerships. Our Australian Sales team sits within our global Sales org under the leadership of Reddit’s EVP and President Global Advertising, Harold Klaje. \"We’ve been fortunate to experience strong organic growth from our Australian user base in recent years, and with this comes a significant opportunity to level-up our local offering in a more focussed and nuanced way,” said Reddit Chief Operating officer, Jen Wong. “From building out our highly engaged Australian communities to finding homes for local brands on the platform, this launch is just the beginning of our investment in the market and key to our wider international vision as we continue to scale Reddit at pace.” Reddit Users in Australia Globally, Reddit brings together more than 52 million Daily Active Users across 100,000+ communities. In Australia, user activity mimics global trends with gaming, crypto and entertainment among the most popular interest groups, but there is a clear local twist. r/australia, the community of 700,000 members where you can “chew the fat about Australia and Australians” is the most popular subreddit among Australian users, with r/ausfinance and r/asx_bets following closely behind. In a surprise to no one, r/afl and r/nrl also make the Top 10 Australian communities list, joining Reddit’s ever-popular Sports Interest Group which attracted more than one billion screen views globally, for the month of April 2021 alone. Local takes on leading global communities are also popular among Australian Reddit users, with r/askanaustralian, r/australianteachers and r/ausproperty among the fastest growing communities for Australian users in 2021. At an average of 31 minutes per day, Australians spend more time on Reddit than they do Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest and they collectively contribute 158 million posts, comments and votes on the platform every month. 62% of our Australian users sit in the highly desirable 18 – 34 year old segment, with 28% aged between 35 – 49. “Fair Dinkum” for Aussie Brands Unlike other social media platforms, Aussies on Reddit are connected by passions and interests, rather than demographics which makes the platform home to some of the most honest, authentic and passionate conversations on the internet. It also makes for an environment you won’t find anywhere else online. 40% of Reddit users in Australia are not on Twitter, 20% are not on Facebook, 23% are not on Instagram, 51% are not on Snapchat and 70% are not on TikTok. “Reddit is a cultural phenomenon and a great platform for brands wishing to connect with customers, fans, and advocates who influence brand loyalty and purchase decisions,” said UM’s US Chief Digital Officer, Joshua Lowcock. “As an Australian expat living in New York, I have seen first-hand the success clients have had working with Reddit. Investing in a dedicated Australian presence and local approach to community and moderation will reinforce Reddit’s market position for locally-based brands and advertisers seeking to navigate the depth and breadth of the platform and unlock its immense value.” Our local Sales team will be committed to helping Australian brands meaningfully participate with these highly engaged, unduplicated audiences through best-in-class creative campaigns, scalable solutions and industry-leading trends and insights. They will work closely with our global team as we continue to evolve the Reddit Ads platform to meet the needs of all advertisers globally. “With the rise and power of online communities, the launch of Reddit in Australia is exciting not only for us but for the industry at large,” said Reprise CEO Maria Grivas. “Reddit is the home of online community and I’m looking forward to seeing more Australian brands embrace these highly influential online spaces and the distinct marketing opportunities they bring, with Reddit’s official introduction to the market.” Reddit is now officially open for business in Australia and is located in Barangaroo, Sydney.

Throughout June, we highlighted historic moments of significance within the LGBTQ+ community with our employees during our weekly All-Hands meetings. This allowed us to learn more about the impact of lesser-known LGBTQIA+ figures and give them the recognition they deserve. And there would be no Pride month without revolutionaries like Marsha P. Johnson, gay liberation activist and prominent figure in the Stonewall uprising of 1969, so for Juneteenth we made sure to underscore the intersectionality of these two communities and honor the pride our Black employees have in their ancestry. And then there was our 2021 Pride Summit, which left us feeling both proud and extremely starstruck! We had an iconic and glee-filled afternoon that featured a drag makeup tutorial with RuPaul’s Drag Race season 13 finalist, Gottmik, a riveting fireside chat with Emmy award-winning actress and LGBTQIA+ activist, Laverne Cox, and performance from one of our favorite RPAN musical acts, Sub-Radio. Other programming included Gay Jeopardy! with members of our executive team and a candid conversation with our mods. We may have beat our face to the gawds and danced the afternoon away but, by anchoring our celebrations in the pillars of education, entertainment, and community building, we created an opportunity for all of our employees and especially those in the LGBTQIA+ community to have a safe space to learn, live and celebrate Pride.

We believe that people should be able to find a welcoming home on our platform and at Reddit. Over the past year, we have evolved Reddit’s workforce and employee experience to further align with our mission. Our goals around Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB) have been focused on shifting internal paradigms while simultaneously increasing our DIB knowledge, understanding, and awareness through different channels across the company. The foundational work has included appointing key leadership, elevating our employee resource groups and programs, and strengthening our approaches to recruiting. We hired our first Head of Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging last year to spearhead our existing DIB strategy and champion new ways to incorporate diversity within employee touchpoints at Reddit. We also welcomed two Black leaders to Reddit’s Board of Directors, including Michael Seibel and Paula Price. We’ve carved out space and programming for employees to connect and cultivate discussions to help build a healthy, inclusive, and supportive community for everyone. Many of these conversations are emboldened in our internal monthly DIB podcast called ‘Courageous Conversations,’ where employees and external guests explore hard topics without code switching and in the spirit of vulnerability. We also designated Juneteenth as an annual company-wide service day where we encourage employees to not work and provide resources to reflect and educate themselves on the importance of this day. Our response to the Black Lives Matter movement and subsequent calls for social justice across several communities has been through a lens of prioritizing support for our underrepresented employees and 10 employee resource groups (ERGs). Our ERGs lead important activations and initiatives at Reddit including hosting Ask Me Anything (AMA) series with public figures, facilitating community involvement, and developing educational resources and interactive programs for employees. As we look towards the future of Reddit’s workforce, we’re committed to evaluating all compensation and promotion decisions through an equity lens and creating inclusive employee experiences. We’ve intentionally focused on inclusion elements such as leadership workshops and coaching sessions for employees. In the past 12 months, we worked with several external organizations and leadership academies to upskill our Black employees in their journey towards management and offer mentorship and educational opportunities. Every Reddit employee is provided yearly stipends to invest in personal and professional learning and development from external sources. These opportunities are intended to help employees achieve their highest possible performance and to bolster new career passions or interests. We’ve also matured our employee recruiting process and shifted our university recruiting strategy to recruit from minority-led student groups, including at HBCUs. This has led to our upcoming intern class for 2021 being over 33% Black and Latinx. We’re constantly evolving our approaches and programs and exploring new ways to bring more community and belonging to all our employees. Our ongoing efforts build towards making sure our company reflects the diversity of our communities, on Reddit and in real life. We thank all of our employees for being an essential part of our journey, their willingness to learn and evolve, and living our values while upholding Reddit’s mission every day."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/introducing-karmalab","date":"2021-04-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Reddit for Business"],"title":"Introducing Reddit’s First In-House Creative Strategy Agency for Advertisers: KarmaLab","text":"As we continue to scale our Ads business in the U.S. and internationally, we are committed to providing industry-leading creative solutions, inspiration and insights to help our partners build and sustain a meaningful presence among Reddit’s 52 million daily active users.

With an offering that includes social listening and trends reports, step-by-step community management, creative workshops, bespoke 360 campaign development and more, KarmaLab is a full-service creative strategy agency delivering campaigns that resonate with and add value to Reddit users, while driving meaningful results. “Recent months have demonstrated more than ever the impact and influence of Reddit’s passionate communities in the cultural zeitgeist. There is amazing potential and opportunities for brands to be part of the internet’s most relevant and authentic conversations, but with more than 100,000 communities on Reddit, some wonder where to start — this is where KarmaLab comes in,” says Global Director of Reddit’s KarmaLab, Will Cady. “Our mission is to help every brand discover how to contribute authentically, meaningfully and effectively to the communities that matter most to them and their audiences — we turn curiosity into understanding, and signals into strategies.” Our Long Term Commitment to Creative Excellence The transition to KarmaLab, which previously operated under Reddit’s Creative Strategy function, is an effort to bolster our creative strategy offering with more dedicated resources as Reddit’s Ads business continues to grow and attract best-in-class talent. “It’s been a fantastic start to the year for Reddit and especially for our Advertising business which continues to grow with exciting momentum,” said Reddit Chief Operating Officer, Jen Wong. “KarmaLab is a long term investment in industry-leading creative strategy for all Reddit advertisers, and will allow us to serve clients with more dedicated resources and diverse skill sets as more brands find their home on the platform.” Setting Brands Up for Success on Reddit KarmaLab’s services are available to all of Reddit’s partners via a scaled offering dependent on campaign objective and need, with the in-house agency already servicing a diverse range of clients. Affordable meal kit delivery service EveryPlate worked with KarmaLab in April to build custom creative for their promoted posts targeting communities like r/eatcheapandhealthy and r/budgetfood to ensure the tone and language resonated with the audience. Similarly, when Samsung set out to explain the benefits of 5G, the brand worked with KarmaLab to empower Reddit’s r/explainlikeimfive community to have them explain 5G in a simple, relatable and compelling way. Hundreds of responses later, Samsung and KarmaLab turned the responses into ads and promoted them across Reddit to help educate the wider community. When Snickers wanted to more deeply engage with Reddit’s audience and “power up” their Promoted Posts, the brand worked with KarmaLab who hosted a creative workshop to develop a media strategy and visuals that evoked the themes of nostalgia and enjoyment in gaming with fun nods to the audiences’ favorite games. “The gaming audience on Reddit is pretty remarkable and we wanted to reach these fans with our campaign in a way that felt natural to the community and would ultimately drive reach and contextual alignment for Snickers.” said Mars Wrigley North America Head of Social Media & Digital Content, Michael Italia. “We worked closely with the KarmaLab team to develop a series of custom gamer-centric creative and copy — targeting communities like r/gaming, r/overwatch and r/xbox — that put the Snickers-spin on some of their favorite games in a way that landed with the highly engaged audience. The creative allowed Snickers to exist within the culture of the communities’ conversations in a very authentic, relevant way.” For more information, to advertise on Reddit or to connect with someone on the KarmaLab team, please contact us."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-honors-aapi-heritage-month","date":"2021-04-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Life at Reddit"],"title":"Reddit Honors AAPI Heritage Month","text":"Today marks the end of an impactful Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month at Reddit, Inc. This year, our acknowledgment and celebrations of the AAPI community took on new significance in the wake of Anti-Asian violence that has occurred across cities nationwide. The recent signing of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which aims at making the reporting of hate crimes more accessible, directs the Department of Justice to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19, and authorizes grants to state and local governments to conduct crime-reduction programs, offers hope that there is a path forward. In that same spirit of hope, our Reddit Asian Network (RAN) Employee Resource Group took this month as an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander heritage by highlighting the richness of the cultures across the diaspora. RAN Presents: Building Interracial Bridges Our month-long series of events was kicked off with an internal roundtable discussion aimed at addressing the history, impact, and solutions around some of the current interracial tensions plaguing minority communities. Reddit employees openly discussed how we can better understand, accept, and celebrate each other’s cultures and identities. So You Think You Can Dance: Bhangra Edition We flexed our dance skills in a Bhangra class led by our very own Amit Varma, Senior Finance Manager. Bhangra is a traditional and energetic style of dance originating in Punjab, Pakistan. All employees were welcomed and encouraged to bust a move, no dancing skills required! Lunch & Learn + RAN Presents: The Immigration Act of 1965 Manisha Patel, Senior Software Engineer, presented an insightful Lunch & Learn presentation about the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 where she highlighted the history of Asian immigration to the U.S. RAN Presents: Folktales of Asia and the Pacific Islands RAN curated a collection of 10 folktales from countries and cultures across Asia and the Pacific Islands, read by our very own Snoos! In addition to being entertaining, these stories are a wonderful way to gain a more nuanced understanding of the diversity of people under the AAPI umbrella. All episodes are available to listen to here. Treats and Trivia And no program would be complete without some amazing food! Emily Huo, Director of SMB Sales & Mid Market, hosted an event where folks could learn more about AAPI heritage through trivia and authentic cuisine. A special thank you to RAN for leading us through a meaningful AAPI Heritage Month celebration, and to all of our employees who actively participate in these important discussions and help us honor each other’s cultures."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/the-state-of-voter-access-in-america","date":"2021-04-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"The State of Voter Access In America","text":"Many know Reddit as a vast network of communities, yet the heart of those communities depends largely on the votes of each individual redditor. Voting is central to how Reddit works, but more importantly, voting also remains a cherished cornerstone of our IRL democracy. This is why, for years, we’ve made nonpartisan voter registration and engagement a cornerstone issue that we’ve sought to elevate both on and off of Reddit. You might have seen these efforts in our “Up The Vote” campaign preceding the 2020 U.S. Election, through which we encouraged voters online and on the street to get out and vote. Or you might have seen it through our annual National Voter Registration Day efforts, connecting redditors with the information they need to register to vote. The participation of voters in 2020 was staggering. Over 159 million Americans voted in the 2020 election, making it the highest recorded turnout in 120 years. Yet in 2021, we are faced with a serious challenge to voter participation. States across the country have either passed or are currently considering legislation that some experts anticipate could erode equal access to voting. You can catch up on the latest legislative developments at NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice. Their latest voting laws roundup gives context to the state of play at each state for March 2021. To educate our community on the state of voter access in America we are announcing a special AMA series today. In the coming weeks, communities around Reddit will host AMAs with academics, non-profits, and legal experts to shine a light on what these laws actually do and the steps concerned citizens can take if they wish to weigh in with their elected officials. Participants confirmed at the time of writing (with more to be added) include: League of Women Voters Friday, June 4th, at 12:00pm PST in r/Politics League of Women Voters The League of Women Voters of the United States encourages informed and active participation in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.

The League is nonpartisan, neither supporting nor opposing candidates or political parties at any level of government.

There is still much work that needs to be done to get us to our goal of having both a userbase and workforce that is reflective of the world’s diversity. Diversity will surely be critical to our success as a company, but it’s not enough. It takes a culture and environment where all of us recognize, understand, accept, and respect our differences to attract diverse voices to our platform and most importantly, enable them to flourish on Reddit. Our company goals are to engage each of our employees in understanding their role as an Ally and build a healthy, inclusive, and supportive workplace for everyone here. These are just some of the tips and resources we’ve shared with our Snoos on our collective journey to becoming more informed and active Allies. This list is just a starting point, it’s important that we continue the learning and conversation around these topics by connecting openly with each other. We’ve decided to communicate this thinking outside of our company in the chance that it can be educational for you, too. Know the basics: Do’s: Be open to listeningBe aware of your implicit biasesYour research to learn more about the history of the struggle in which you are participatingThe inner work to figure out a way to acknowledge how you participate in oppressive systemsThe outer work and figure out how to change oppressive systemsAmplify (both online and IRL) the voices of those without your privilege Don’ts: Put the onus on others to teach or show you. Take it upon yourself to use the tools around you to learn and help answer your own questions.Take credit for the labor of those who are marginalized and did the work before you stepped in the picture.Assume that every member of a marginalized group feels oppressed or the same way as each other. Everyone has a right to their individual experience and feelings. Specific examples from our ERGs (employee resource groups) on how to be an effective Ally: Acknowledge that communities you aren’t a part of are being impacted by events. This can be as simple as asking how someone is doing or sharing your own thoughts about a situation. It can be awkward and uncomfortable — do it anyway. We’re all watching the news and when you carry on as if you’re unaffected, it can feel isolating.Allow for other POVs to enter the space. So, if certain voices are typically dominant, try empowering other voices perhaps through alternative feedback opportunities or letting people know their feedback is requested/valuable.Mis-gendering can be a real issue. Helping others correct themselves and making an effort to use someone’s preferred pronoun, especially for non-binary people who go by they/them, is always helpful.People in the Asian community are often confused with one another, sometimes even being called someone else’s name. Allies should speak up when they notice this happening in the workplace.For ERG events, raise a hand if you would like to volunteer in any capacity and simply show up for activities that are open to all. Learn More The resources below can be leveraged to increase your understanding of marginalized groups from varying perspectives. This is not intended to be a complete list and we will continue to add to it as new content and perspectives develop.

Home to our third largest user base after the U.S. and U.K. — and growing by 40% year-over-year — Canada is the natural next place for Reddit to establish a new, on-the-ground presence. Our team (of very nice, polite people) based in Toronto is already partnering with local entities, establishing programs for community engagement, servicing local Canadian brands and marketers, and is managed by Reddit’s Head of International, Tariq Mahmoud, who was at the helm of Reddit’s 2020 expansion to the U.K. Our Canadian Sales team sits within our global Sales Org under the leadership of Reddit’s EVP and President Global Advertising, Harold Klaje. Building on an already strong foundation Globally, Reddit brings together more than 52 million Daily Active Users across more than 100,000 communities related to just about every topic — from pets to personal finance and everything in between. In Canada, our users skew young with 59% aged between 18 – 34, and more than 40% of users are female. At 31 minutes a day, Reddit users in Canada spend more time in-app than almost all other social media platforms. Like most on Reddit, the passions and interests of Canadian users are vast and varied — be it seeking advice and offering support in r/personalfinancecanada, engaging in healthy discourse in r/canadapolitics, fielding questions from the rest of the world in r/AskACanadian or uniting in their universal love of hockey and basketball in communities like r/canucks or r/torontoraptors. In 2020, the Entertainment, Gaming, News & Education, Family & Relationships and Sports interest groups were the most popular among Canadian users and r/askreddit, r/worldnews and r/vancouver were some of the most visited communities. “Canada is already home to a deeply engaged Reddit audience that is growing steadily by the day and it is a top priority for us and our internationalization strategy,” said Reddit’s Chief Operating Officer, Jen Wong. “Establishing a dedicated presence in the market will ensure best-in-class teams, tools and resources to continue to build out our growing user base and level-up our offering to local clients in a more focussed, nuanced way.” The Power of Reddit for Canadian brands On Reddit, users are connected by interests rather than demographics, and this makes for an environment of highly engaged, authentic and passionate communities that can’t be found anywhere else online. In Canada, more than 20% of Reddit users are not on Facebook, while 70% are not on TikTok and almost 35% are not on Twitter. The Toronto team will be committed to helping Canadian brands find their home on Reddit, and will work closely with our global team as we continue to evolve the Reddit Ads platform to meet the needs of all advertisers. “GroupM is excited about the launch of Reddit in Canada,” said GroupM Chief Investment Officer, Sebastian Rennie. “Investing in a Canadian-based operation tailored to the uniqueness of the platform and its audience behaviour regionally brings distinct new advertising and communication opportunities to the Canadian marketplace.” Brands like Tim Hortons, Lenovo, General Mills, CDW and Call of Duty: Mobile are among those already working with our team to engage Canada’s most passionate online audience, with great results. “Reddit’s communities offer a platform to bring brand personality to life and foster meaningful interaction with engaged audiences who are already interested in the topic or subject,” said Tim Hortons Senior Director, Marketing Communications, Solange Bernard. “One of our recent campaigns aimed to drive as many people as possible to our NHL Hockey Challenge app, so we targeted Reddit’s r/hockey and leveraged the fun and playful tone of the community in our creative, which ultimately drove strong success for us. Partnering with Reddit lets us share our content in a highly visible way that resonates with Canadian users.” We’re just getting started Today’s launch marks a long term investment in Canada and the start of an ambitious growth strategy which includes additional key hires, namely a Country Manager, responsible for the overall direction and management of the business in Canada, and additional Sales leadership roles which will be announced in the coming weeks. Reddit is now officially open for business in Canada and is located on University Avenue in Toronto. For more information or to learn more about advertising opportunities or case studies, contact us.

Laura is a global leader with a 15-year track record of building strategic, high-impact teams and scalable community systems at growth-stage startups. In her role, Nestler will lead Reddit’s Community Operations team where she’ll be responsible for defining our international community strategy, driving key initiatives for community development, evolving Reddit’s community governance model, and transitioning the team into a global organization. Reddit is the world’s largest network of interest-based communities (more than 100,000!) where people can dive into any topic ranging from r/sports and r/unitedkingdom to r/animalsbeingderps and r/wholesomememes. With more than 50 million daily users, our members create, govern, and grow all of the deeply unique communities that make up the Reddit experience. These communities inspire belonging by connecting millions of people across the globe, and the Community Operations team that supports and enhances these community experiences is at the heart of our mission-driven company. “Reddit is one of the most human places on the internet that was built by real, passionate people. Over the past 16 years, we’ve watched that passion for community and connection flourish on the platform,” said VP of Product, Design, and Community, Alex Le. “Laura embodies the true meaning of community and belonging and will be an excellent trailblazer as we mature our Community team and reach millions of more users across the globe.” Nestler is joining Reddit from Duolingo, where she served as Global Head of Community, working across product, marketing, and strategy to develop vibrant and authentic community products and programs. She spearheaded community-focused global brand initiatives, including developing indigenous and endangered language courses, producing a documentary on the impact of language on refugee communities, and launching Duolingo’s annual global user conference. She also led the community marketing strategy for the company’s new initiatives, focused on platform growth and early adoption. In this capacity, she created and scaled Duolingo’s in-person events from 0 to 600/week across 113 countries, 820 cities, and 34 languages. Prior to Duolingo, Nestler spent nine years at Yelp, where she was instrumental in crafting the original community growth playbook before moving to London (UK) and Sydney (AUS) for seven years to drive Yelp’s international expansion. Upon returning to the United States, she built Yelp’s small market expansion model and scaled to 60+ cities throughout North America. Nestler is passionate about community-led growth and speaks internationally on related topics. She serves in advisory, board, and investor roles for organizations that build products with community intentionality, and finds immense joy in mentoring early-career community professionals as they navigate this relatively nascent career path. She has a BA in English from Whittier College and an MBA from Concordia University. In her spare time, Nestler enjoys playing sports and musical instruments, voraciously consuming podcasts, exploring new cities, and meandering through her favorite Reddit communities including r/Aviation, r/Wanderlust, and r/AskReddit. “Reddit’s community — having been built from the ground up by its members — has been one of the most fascinating models to watch evolve as the platform grows,” said Nestler. “I’m looking forward to immersing myself in the unique dynamics of the community and diving headfirst into building an operations program that not only scales the community globally, but also provides the support, sustainability, and engagement needed to do so. I’m honored and eager to deliver on Reddit’s mission to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world.” Nestler begins immediately and will report directly to Reddit’s VP of Product, Design, and Community, Alex Le."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-omnicom-media-group-announce-flagship-enterprise-partnership-agreement","date":"2021-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Reddit for Business"],"title":"Reddit and Omnicom Media Group Announce Flagship Enterprise Partnership Agreement","text":"As part of our ongoing commitment to scale Reddit’s advertising business in the U.S. and globally, we are excited to announce today an Enterprise Partnership agreement with Omnicom Media Group (OMG), the media services division of global marketing and corporate communications company Omnicom Media Group (NYSE: OMC). A first for Reddit, and led by our Global Agency Development team, the partnership will provide the clients of OMG agencies Hearts & Science, OMD, PHD and Resolution access to a range of strategic and commercial benefits that will enhance the value of their media spend on Reddit. About the Partnership Under the terms of the agreement, the first of its kind for Reddit, OMG clients will have access to the very best of Reddit’s creative strategy team, education and training tools, innovation offering — including early ad product and feature testing — measurement and reporting, data, and Reddit’s unique insights capability. With increased access to these tools, teams and resources, OMG clients will be able to more effectively engage with Reddit’s 52 million daily active users. The Power of Reddit’s Communities With more than 100,000 communities dedicated to every topic imaginable, Reddit’s advertising business is continuing to grow at pace, as brands large and small experience the benefits of engaging with the internet’s most passionate users. “The social media ecosystem is changing – we’re seeing an outflow of media consumption from people-based platforms, and an inflow towards interest-based platforms,” said Reddit’s Global Agency Lead for Omnicom Media Group, Andrew Abbott. “We’ve been working with Omnicom Media Group for some time to help their agencies and clients navigate this shift towards online communities and ensure their effective place within them. Formalizing this partnership is a logical and exciting next step towards greater collaboration and client success.” Time and time again on Reddit we see the conversations, advice and recommendations that take place within online communities have the power to proliferate to the real world, which brings immense opportunity for brands and advertisers. “At a time when brands are more focused than ever on building an emotional connection with consumers, Reddit’s communities offer a unique opportunity for brands to engage with customers around their passion points,” said OMG President, US Investment, Sal Candela.” This agreement exemplifies Omnicom Media Group’s commitment to assuring first-mover competitive advantage for our clients through best-in-class partnerships.” Shared Values Additionally, over the past several months, OMG and Reddit have been working together to advance brand safety through OMG’s Council on Accountable Social Advertising (CASA), an initiative created to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear on social media platforms. One of six social media brands and more than 70 clients participating in CASA, Reddit was the first platform to endorse all four “pillars” of the CASA initiative – including adjacency controls and dashboards, third party verification, and violation prevalence reporting – designed to bring the same level of control to the social ecosystem as is available in traditional media channels. Reddit is committed to providing all advertisers maximum choice, control and, ultimately, confidence in every aspect of their campaigns, including where their ads appear adjacent to.

In typical Reddit fashion, the conversations covered a range of topics, from team uniforms, to superb owls, and even a surprise ad from us, as football (and non-football) fans came together for sport’s biggest day of the year. Let’s take a deeper look into these conversations and hear directly from our moderators on how their communities celebrated a very unique Super Bowl and football season. Reddit MVPs: Community Engagement and Reflections r/NFL Data nugget: The community saw a +39% increase in views during the period 1/31-2/7. Most Upvoted Posts on Super Bowl Sunday (as of this posting): Between Tom Brady’s 3rd Superbowl appearance and his 10th, Calvin Johnson has been drafted, retired, and made the Hall of Fame. [NFL Update on Twitter]Tom Brady now has more Super Bowl wins than all 32 NFL franchises.[Highlight] Antoine Winfield Jr taunts Tyreek Hill[NFL Update] One note on Calvin Johnson making the Hall of Fame: He’s only the third WR in the last 25 years to make the HOF on the first ballot, joining Jerry Rice and Randy Moss.Post Game Thread: Kansas City Chiefs (14-2) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (11-5) From the Mods: Surpassing 2 million subscribers in November, r/NFL remains the premier place to discuss all things American football. And from game day polls to post-game threads, fans came to r/NFL to discuss last night’s biggest moments. But the conversations were not limited to last night specifically, here’s what the community’s mods noted as the bigger topics from the 2020 season, as discussed in the community: “players rising or falling in fame/significance…the continued resurgence of the Bills, the breakout season for the Browns and the surprising fall of the Texans would be some of the more high-profile storylines…the Deshaun Watson/Houston standoff is the biggest news right now, aside from the Super Bowl. This weekend there was a pretty significant trade involving two fairly big name quarterbacks, and the fall out of that is going to be discussed for a while.” r/Buccaneers Data nugget: The community saw a 151% increase in views during the period 1/31-2/7. Most Upvoted Posts on Super Bowl Sunday (as of this posting): r/Buccaneers Official WE WON THE SUPER BOWL GET IN HERE ThreadKnock, KnockThe revenge.This year we went back to the old uniforms. This year we went back to the Superbowl. Never change them again.After 9 seasons, 4 Head Coaches, and countless Pro Bowl snubs, Lavonte David is a World Champion!!! From the Mods: A new Super Bowl title isn’t the only thing the r/Buccaneers community had to cheer about this season. With the addition of Tom Brady to the team, r/Buccaneers saw an immediate increase in subscribers, united by a shared excitement and support for one another during a season very different to what we’re all used to. The community’s moderators said members of r/Buccaneers continue to offer support for one another during the pandemic: “We’ve made a real concerted effort to check in with regulars from the r/Buccaneers community, because let’s be real — this pandemic has been really difficult for so many of us. We’ve lost loved ones, many of us have been infected with COVID itself, we have healthcare workers fighting this on the frontlines and the feeling of isolation in this remote environment is real…we want everyone in the community to know this is a space they can go to escape the real world, and direct them to any resources should they need help. r/Buccaneers is more than a football forum to the mods. It’s a community, and the pandemic has helped strengthen that sense of community in a funny way.” r/KansasCityChiefs Data nugget: The community saw a 310% increase in views during the period 1/31-2/7.

From the Mods: After two straight Super Bowl appearances, r/KansasCityChiefs have added daily discussion threads to address the community’s growth and provide a place where all Chiefs fans can talk about the team, which has fueled discussion in a positive way. The mods reflected on the community (and team’s) growing popularity: “I remember back in 2013 how small our sub was. It’s a completely different beast now and Patrick Mahomes is truly driving a new era of Chiefs football…being to two Super Bowls, having your QB win MVP, and winning the Super Bowl [last year] have all given Chiefs fans a wonderful, and somewhat cathartic, feeling that their fandom was worth it.” r/TheWeeknd Data nugget: The community saw a 335% increase in screenviews during the period 1/31-2/7. Most Upvoted Posts on Super Bowl Sunday (as of this posting): oh god oh f*ckLana Del Rey’s father on instagram…The Toronto Mayor official made the 7th of February The Weeknd Day That house of balloons transition to blinding lights was fire asfThis part alone killed the entire thing From the Mods: r/TheWeeknd is home to the most passionate fans of the music superstar, so it’s no surprise that his most loyal fans came to the community to break down the surprising songs, biggest memes and overall production value of his halftime performance. Mods from r/TheWeeknd expressed what the now iconic moment meant to his biggest fans: “It means the world to us honestly. Most of the fans in the community have been following The Weeknd ever since the original mixtapes came out in 2011. The Super Bowl is probably the biggest gig you can book as an artist and it’s such a surreal feeling that The Weeknd has been selected to perform this year for hundreds of millions of viewers. We’re proud of him and it goes to show that hard work does pay off.” Off the Field: Chatter about Commercials Yes, you saw that! We made a Super Bowl ad. The blink-and-you’ll-miss-it creative flashed on screens in 9 of the top 10 U.S. metro markets as a tribute to the power of community we see on Reddit every day, and especially so in recent weeks. “It’s been exciting to see more and more people around the world start to understand and take interest in the power of Reddit’s online communities in recent weeks,” said Reddit Chief Marketing Officer, Roxy Young. “Our Super Bowl ad was a mammoth effort from a lot of hardworking people who pulled together an impactful 5-second spot — which is no easy feat — in just a few days. This ad is a celebration of Reddit communities, and an aptly-timed reminder that when people come together around their passion, powerful things can happen.” The ad, which was created in collaboration with our agency partners at R/GA, was also posted to r/blog and has to-date received over 70k upvotes and over a thousand awards as Reddit users delighted in seeing a nod to their communities flash on screen, posting photos of their TVs in excitement and garnering around 200K additional upvotes. And we were in good company with this year’s Super Bowl ads, which continued to garner almost as much attention as the game itself. Here’s what Reddit users had to say about the commercial breaks: General Motors, Cheetos, State Farm and Doritos dominated post-game conversations around the “best” ads and 3D Doritos, Drake from State Farm and Bud Light were all trending topics on Reddit during the game itself Conversations within this post-game thread revealed General Motors’ spot featuring Will Farrell (and other notable names), as a crowd-favorite, while State Farm’s “Drake from State Farm”, with its slew of famous faces, won out on the comedy front. Reddit users also shared a lot of love for Dorritos’ 3D Crunch placement, dubbing it the commercial to beat and highly effectiveA general theme across the board from Reddit users was a fatigue for commercials from brands that appeared to virtue signal or “pat themselves” on the back, with users instead calling for more humor from their ad breaks Celebrating Superb Owls A Reddit Super Bowl tradition, users flocked to the r/SuperbOwl community to post pictures, videos, and memes of their favorite game day bird.

Time and again, we have seen the power of community and connection alongside the growth and evolution of those communities and the humans behind them. Today, we’re excited to take another step forward in our evolution and announce a new round of funding. Up and to the Right We have come a long way in recent years to focus more on the needs of the hundreds of thousands of communities that make up Reddit and on creating feature-rich, safe, engaging, spaces for meaningful conversations for our 50+ million daily users. We have also continued to scale our Advertising business, which is now poised to deliver performance and engagement in addition to brand awareness. Advertisers have responded favorably to our efforts and the authenticity of community on Reddit, with direct advertising revenue increasing 90 percent in the last quarter, year-over-year. We continue to invest in building and improving the ways people on Reddit connect — whether that’s traditionally through text-based discussions or through video or live streaming. Our more recent developments have included acquiring the short-form video platform Dubsmash to bring highly polished video creation tools to our platform and encourage under-represented creators to find a home on Reddit. Bolstering Our Resources We have raised more than $250 million in Series E funding from existing and new investors. We decided that now was the right opportunity to make strategic investments in Reddit including video, advertising, consumer products, and expanding into international markets. We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it’s surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world. We are confident in our mission to provide community and belonging to everyone and are well-positioned for the growth we have planned.

Providing transparency to advertisers on how users engage with their ads is a critical feature for any advertising platform. To derive the information that advertisers care about, we need to empower them to perform specific aggregates and breakdowns across large amounts of data. Our ads generate tens of gigabytes of event data per hour. Allowing advertisers to query across the last six months of data means that we have hundreds of billions of raw events to sift through. We also need to scale well beyond this since we expect our event volume to significantly increase over the next year. As our Ads business has scaled, we’ve outgrown our old reporting system. Here is a simplified version of how an event would flow from a Reddit client to our reporting dashboard, per our old system: A Reddit client fires events (view, click, etc.) to our server. These events get written to Kafka as they are received.A Spark job validates incoming events and writes them into Amazon S3 as parquet files.Another Spark job pre-aggregates the data based on reporting queries that we need to fulfill and inserts the output into Redis.The reporting service responds to UI requests by calculating customer-requested breakdowns and aggregates. The pre-aggregated data was stored in Redis using the following schema: <advertiserId:date>: { <breakdown1:breakdown2:breakdown3>: aggregatedMetrics, <breakdown1:breakdown4>: aggregatedMetrics, <breakdown1:breakdown5>: aggregatedMetrics,} Redis stored one entry per advertiser per day. Each of these entries was a Thrift-serialized dictionary containing more keys/values. The keys in this dictionary were composed of a group of possible breakdown values, for example, ad ID and community. Finally, each of these keys would point to the aggregated reporting data. The aggregated data contained values for over 50 data points, such as views and clicks. Let’s consider a simple query where an advertiser wants to see how their ad is performing today in a particular community. In this scenario, the reporting system would do the following: MGET the Redis data using the advertiser ID and date as the lookup key.Deserialize the Thrift data returned by Redis into a dictionary.Pull the aggregated data out of the dictionary using the requested ad ID and community as the lookup key.Respond to the request with the aggregated data. This system was fast for simple queries that we could pre-aggregate. However, it had issues as our data and product offerings grew. Being a key-value store, Redis doesn’t offer a solution for grouping data or performing aggregates across many keys. The lack of querying functionality in Redis meant that we had to implement this logic in our application code. Imagine a scenario where an advertiser wants to generate a report showing how many clicks each of their ads received across the past six months. Our application code must MGET many Redis values (one for each day), deserialize them all, and perform any additional aggregations on that data since our pre-aggregated data is more granular. Having to implement this logic ourselves increased the maintenance burden and surface area for bugs. This system also had issues with memory usage. Queries that had to fetch many keys from Redis would cause our reporting service to deserialize large quantities of Thrift data. Deserializing all of this Thrift data was slow and required a lot of memory. We had to over-provision the reporting service to anticipate large queries. This system resulted in a degraded experience as our advertisers got larger. Another issue with the system was that it wasn’t flexible. Adding new breakdown capabilities usually meant adding new pre-aggregates before inserting the data into Redis. We would then have to implement corresponding querying logic in the reporting service. Adding new fields also required a lot of work to wire them through the entire pipeline. It was clear that our data store was not nearly as flexible as the products that we needed to support. Leveling Up With Apache Druid As part of our commitment to consistently meet the needs of our advertisers, it was clear a solution was needed to better accommodate our growing Ads business. After investigating potential solutions, the team decided to move to Druid. Druid is a columnar database designed to ingest high volumes of raw events with ingestion-time aggregation and perform sub-second query-time aggregates across those events, making it an excellent fit for our use-case. Additionally, we worked with our partners at Imply to quickly operationalize this system. The updated flow of an event to our reporting dashboard now looks like this: A Reddit client fires events (view, click, etc.) to our server. These events get placed onto Kafka as they are received.A Spark job validates incoming events and places them into Amazon S3 as parquet files.Another Spark job performs minor transformations on these parquet files to make them appropriate for Druid to ingest.The reporting service responds to UI requests by querying Druid. Druid’s ingestion-time aggregation means there is no longer a need to write custom logic to pre-aggregate the data based on our product needs. We can tell Druid how to pre-aggregate our data via an ingestion spec and remove all pre-aggregation logic from our pipeline. Additionally, our reporting service is no longer responsible for implementing any group-by or aggregation logic since it is now just part of the query sent to Druid. This has dramatically reduced our reporting pipeline’s maintenance burden and allows us to offer a much better product. The schema used in our Druid data source is simple. We have a column for each dimension that we need to group-by and a single column indicating the event type. We can now easily solve the use-case above where the advertiser wants to generate a six-month report for all of their ads using a single SQL query SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reporting_eventsWHERE advertiser_id == $advertiser_idAND event_type == ‘click’AND date >= $start_date AND date <= $end_dateGROUP BY date, ad_id; Responding to this query is not a problem for Druid despite the large number of raw events we ingest. Druid’s column-oriented storage and event rollup make it perfect for serving up these large aggregate queries. Results Migrating our reporting pipeline to Druid has significantly reduced our surface area for bugs and made the system more flexible to changing product requirements. Additionally, we have consistent memory usage across our reporting service. We no longer need to over-provision our reporting service just in case large advertisers log in. The largest benefits of this migration can be seen in our availability and latency graphs. As you can see below, the new reporting service (blue) is consistently more available than the legacy system (green). Our legacy system struggled to maintain 99.5% availability at times while our new service is generally able to maintain 99.9% availability. When looking at the latency graphs, our legacy system (green) had a p99 of nearly two seconds. The new Druid-backed reporting system typically responds 2-3x faster. Similar benefits can also be observed in our p50 graphs. Our partnership with Imply also gave us access to their Pivot product. This product provides an intuitive UI for building dashboards to monitor the health of our business. We can now quickly create dashboards that allow us to easily monitor revenue and other key metrics. These dashboards have proven useful for developers to investigate issues in the ad delivery pipeline. The Future Druid has been great for keeping our reporting product flexible to new features that advertisers want. It allows us to more easily bring new breakdowns to our advertisers and we may even be able to offer timezone-based queries in the future. We are also very excited to start making our reporting platform near real-time. Currently, our dashboard updates on an hourly cadence as our pipeline of Spark jobs run. However, Druid can ingest events straight from Kafka which will get performance data to advertisers almost immediately.

The project should be geared towards stretching their mentee’s current skill set and be valuable in nature (think: architectural projects or framework improvements that would improve the engineering org as a whole). At the end of the program, mentees walk away with a completed project under their belt and showcase their improvements to the entire company during one of our weekly All Hands meetings. We recently wrapped up a GAINS cohort and want to share (read: humble brag about) some of the incredible projects participants executed. New Compression Type for Event Pipeline Cluster Qikai Wu, Software Engineer Reddit hosts a large Kafka event pipeline with peak traffic of 600K events per second to support the process and analysis of various kinds of events. With the growth of daily active users and ongoing expansion towards international markets, we expect to see corresponding increases in terms of event traffic and AWS cost of event pipeline in the near future. In this project, we would like to leverage the zstandard compression in Kafka to improve performance of the event pipeline, which will help Reddit be better prepared for future growth. With the recent upgrade of Kafka to 2.4+, we decided to switch the compression type in the event pipeline from gzip to zstd, which is a relatively easy fix with potentially large impact. To compare the performance of these two compression types, we compressed json files with varying number of events (from 50K to 500K) with the cli tools of Apple gzip 272.250.1 (compression level = 6) and zstd v1.4.5 (compression level = 3). From above results, we noticed zstd outperform gzip in compression ratio and compression speed, while gzip has better decompression speed. Also, zstd has better compression speed and decompression speed with file size increasing, while the speed of gzip stays constant. Our tests for decompression speed have contradicted results of decompression speed compared to Facebook’s tests, which could be due to the difference in testing data sets. In order to ensure the conversion of compression type runs smoothly, we addressed several potential risks by performing the following steps before making deployment in the production cluster: Go through all the producers and consumers and verify they support zstdVerify Kafka topics with mixed compression types doesn’t have compatibility issues.Test in the staging cluster to monitor the memory and CPU usage of zstd with smaller traffic and prepare to increase resource limit accordingly. After switching the compression type in the production cluster, we observed the following results. Pros: 15% less CPU usage on brokers40% less memory usage on Flink consumers Cons: Less than 1 second increase in consumer latencyNo evident changes in network traffic Although there is a mixed impact of zstd, we are still satisfied with the change since the event pipeline is mainly used for analytics and the space for more consumers is a bigger win compared to a sub-second increase of latency. What’s more, we expect to further leverage zstd by using larger batch sizes, tuning compression levels, and utilizing dictionary compression in the future. ________________________ Kafka Consumer Support for Baseplate.go Sergei Uversky, Software Engineer II Here at Reddit, we’ve been working on standardizing service development around a common Reddit foundation called Baseplate. Baseplate is an abstract specification for a service framework that allows services to adhere to the idioms of their implementation language, while providing common plumbing components, such as communication protocols, secrets storage, tracing, logging, metrics, and more. Historically, the Python implementation, baseplate.py, was the only extant concrete implementation of the Baseplate specification. With the growth of the company (both in headcount and user base), we have felt a need to enable service development in a language more performant than Python. In late 2019, several engineers proficient in Go had begun working on baseplate.go. Enough progress was made that by May 2020, one key service was ported from Python to Go using the new framework, resulting in a 4x reduction of CPU usage under identical levels of load. While this early success was heartening, baseplate.go was still not ready for widespread adoption, due to a lack of feature parity to the more mature Python implementation. One feature missing from baseplate.go that was sorely needed by many service owners is support for Kafka. To add this integration, we first needed to tweak the server interface to close Kafka consumers gracefully without losing data. We did this by extending baseplate.go’s server.Serve() wrapper to accept two optional slices of io.Closers that get cleaned up before and after a server.Close() call is invoked. Then, a reference group consumer implementation was created by wrapping Shopify’s Sarama Kafka client library with configuration allowing service-side YAML consumer configuration, thread-safe group consumption, and clean shutdown. This represents an exciting step toward feature parity with baseplate.py, and the reference consumer should be useful for future implementation work. __________ Rolling out with Snooctl Doctor Adam Espinola, Software Engineer II As you may know, Reddit is a high traffic site. Thousands of requests per second and millions of users at any given time. These big numbers are stressful which means, for developers, deploying changes into Reddit’s large and complicated environment can be a nerve-racking process. All the noise that comes with scale means that one-in-a-million events happen frequently, finding regressions among all the smoke can be a literal needle in a haystack. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Deployment troubleshooting is a manual and time-consuming process. One that could be automated. Most of Reddit’s stack has moved over to Kubernetes (k8s), which has meant significant improvements to the deployment process, and has introduced modern infrastructure tooling like Spinnaker. Thanks to those efforts, the act of deploying has been condensed into a handful of clicks. It’s become easy enough to get your deployment out in the water, but knowing if it sails or sinks remains less straight-forward. To explain why, we have to take a deeper look at Spinnaker. Our story with Spinnaker We use Spinnaker for continuous delivery, it works but has a complicated relationship with k8s. Internally, it has to hold its own model of cloud resources mapped to k8s resources. It can be difficult to reason about what’s going on based solely on the model, so the mismatch there sometimes puts Spinnaker in strange states. A common problem we see is when Spinnaker raises false negatives about the status of a deploy, contradicting what we observe in k8s. Spinnaker also doesn’t provide helpful information when things do go wrong, so usually engineers have to turn to their respective k8s experts for help, accumulating more time and energy than necessary for what are usually fairly trivial issues. In just the first week of December 2020, there were almost 200 deploy failures. With more suitable tooling, these issues could be resolved faster and all that toil would be avoided. A lens of truth Our solution for this problem was to build an automated troubleshooter for common deployment issues found in production so that devs can easily point out what’s going wrong without having to be a k8s savant. We built this on top of the snooctl (/sno͞o-control/) platform, which is a collection of backend tooling written in Golang. Now when a developer’s deployment halts for some unknown reason, they can use this ‘lens of truth’ and reveal what was previously hidden with a single command. Under the hood, the program constructs a model of an in-flight k8s deployment and passes it through a series of checks. During development, we figured we could abstract these checks from the internal state-checking machinery so that future extensions would be easier for detecting other, more nuanced problems as our infrastructure matures. The program’s interface was also kept abstract, so that it can be embeddable in whatever pipeline or process we decide to adopt in the future. As Reddit’s infrastructure evolves, so will our problems, and with the help of this tooling we can track those down even sooner than before. ____________ Dead Code Vulture Sreeprasad Govindankutty, Software Engineer III As Reddit has continued to grow, our platform architecture and codebase logic have been updated numerous times. Development in service repositories at Reddit has at times resulted in unreachable code. Dead code is the logic implemented in classes, methods, or functions that are no longer invoked. Preliminary research demonstrates we can often detect the dead code in an automated way, using off-the-shelf static analysis modules. Dead code adds to the size of the program, increases build time and may use resources or endpoints that are deprecated. Additionally, tests written against dead code offer less confidence. Removing dead code from codebase reduces program size and consequently the time spent by developers understanding the logic and intent. This facilitates easier onboarding for new engineers, eliminates the time spent by developers in debugging functions that are no longer used, and helps narrow search results when searching code. The Dead Code Vulture project leverages the vulture library to identify dead code and create a report. The repository owner can then simply delete the unused code. The project pulls down and examines all the python baseplate services. Then a report is created with dead classes, functions, and variables in each repository. Clicking on the function in the report takes you to the function in the actual code repository in Github. This also allows you to verify that function is not used anywhere. Sometimes internal Baseplate functions used once during service setup could also be reported. Adding whitelisted common base plate functions to remove them fixes this issue. Through Dead Code Vulture, we were able to remove 1,169 lines of dead functions from a single service alone! Other engineers have started leveraging Dead Code Vulture reports to identify and remove dead code in the services they own. Our next step is to extend the Dead Code Vulture capabilities to include additional features, such as dead experiments, which would allow repository owners to add whitelisting functions or classes. ___________ Leveling Up AMP Validation Tina Dibs, Software Engineer III More than a whopping 25% of Reddit’s traffic is from mobile AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) platform, a large portion of which comes through Google search (Google indexes AMP sites higher in search because they are dependably fast). Google search is oftentimes the first place that a new user encounters Reddit, meaning that any increase in site performance and reliability can have significant effects at the top of our user acquisition funnel. This is all to say that a more reliable AMP platform can help to drive traffic to our site and apps.However, until recently, our AMP platform had a glaring susceptibility to human error. As a part of the AMP framework, Google imposes various rules and restrictions to ensure that the page is fast. Because of this, the AMP code needs to be validated to ensure it meets Google’s criteria. Not long ago, AMP pages had to be manually validated (using the AMP Validator Chrome extension) every time a Reddit engineer made a change. This made the platform vulnerable to engineer error – for example, if a new engineer wasn’t familiar with the testing process and thus skipped it or if a more experienced engineer forgot to test an affected page. And if invalid code (the code in the image to the left, for example) slipped into production, it could deindex the AMP page and consequently reduce Reddit traffic while wasting hours of developer time spent identifying, debugging, and resolving the incident. To solve this problem, we created Automatic AMP Validation using the amphtml-validator package, which adds a build step to Drone CI that automatically validates AMP post pages every time code is built on staging or merged to production. It does so by starting a local server and using the amphtml-validator command line tool to validate test pages. The step checks an example of every type of post on Reddit – including text, image, video, and more – to ensure that no corner-case bugs arise. This automatic and more thorough validation ensures that invalid AMP cannot be merged to production and, therefore, fewer production incidents occur. Likewise, time spent on manual validation and production incident recovery has been drastically reduced! Thanks to automation, we’ve been able to level up both our AMP platform’s dependability and dev processes."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/in-2020-you-asked-experts-anything","date":"2020-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"In 2020, You Asked Experts Anything","text":"2020 was a monumental year, to say the least. From the Coronavirus pandemic to a global social justice movement to a historic U.S. presidential election, our society faced — and continues to face — unimaginable challenges that have forced us all to adapt to new realities. Throughout these events, people around the world have turned to online communities more than ever before to stay connected, provide support, and find evidence-based information. One of the tried-and-true ways Reddit and its communities facilitate this is through AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions. In its simplest form, AMAs allow redditors to engage directly with people they might not otherwise have a chance to meet, which is truly a special concept. And during a year that coincided with an era of rampant misinformation, AMAs provided a framework for experts across many fields — such as political science, virology, and human rights — to deliver factual information and provide answers to redditors’ most pressing questions. Last year, Reddit’s Policy team, in cooperation with our Community team, dedicated time and resources to ensure that redditors had access to a strong lineup of experts who were willing to participate in discussions about some of our world’s most pressing topics. We worked with 8 communities, including r/politics, r/BlackPeopleTwitter, and r/Coronavirus, to host a steady drumbeat of AMAs with subject experts that we personally sourced and vetted. From March to October 2020, we completed five separate series geared towards current events: Expert Conversation on Coronavirus, Public Trust in an Era of Doubt, Voices of Change, Voting in America, and What Happens Now? Post-Election AMA Series. All in all, we coordinated 51 AMAs with 104 experts resulting in 79 million impressions, 7 million views, and over 51,000 comments this year. We are grateful for the communities who worked with us to ensure they were successful. Given the success and popularity of this program, we plan to continue it into 2021. Be on the lookout for a series on the COVID vaccine early this year!"},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-oracle-data-cloud-team-up-to-provide-independent-third-party-verification-around-reddit-ad-views","date":"2020-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Reddit for Business"],"title":"Reddit and Oracle Data Cloud Team Up to Provide Independent, Third-Party Verification Around Reddit Ad Views","text":"As Reddit’s advertiser and user base continue to scale — with 52 million daily active users, up 44% year over year¹ — it is important to provide an added layer of transparency around the reach and awareness of Reddit ads. We are therefore thrilled to today announce Reddit’s integration with Moat by Oracle Data Cloud, our first viewability measurement collaboration, to provide third party verification on Reddit ad views. Part of an ongoing commitment to meet the needs of our advertisers, this integration provides an additional, independent report on the viewability and reach of their Reddit ads, which are already demonstrating above-benchmark results in early testing. The server-to-server integration has been custom-built for Reddit and is currently in the Alpha phase of testing, open to a limited number of partners, before being more broadly available in early 2021. About the collaboration In September, we launched our first-of-kind collaboration with Oracle Data Cloud to enable more advertiser control over individual brand safety requirements via a new Limited Inventory tier. Our latest integration with Moat will now bring more third-party clarity and precision around Reddit ad viewability. It aims to deliver more comprehensive and meaningful campaign performance metrics to ensure our brand partners understand the impact of their advertising in order to maximize awareness, reach, and overall effectiveness on Reddit. “Third party verification is an important part of campaign measurement and we want to ensure our advertisers have the tools they need to feel confident and satisfied with their investment in Reddit,” said Reddit’s Global Head of Marketing Sciences, Jack Koch. “Ad viewability is a fundamental metric to assess overall campaign success and we’re excited to bring an added layer of transparency to our advertisers to help them maximize their results — what’s more, we’re pleased to now verify what we’ve long known to be true: that Reddit ads exceed industry benchmarks when it comes to awareness and reach.\" Results so far In recent months, Reddit has been testing this integration with several brand partners across multiple industry categories. Across campaigns, the performance of Reddit’s native in-feed ads outperformed Moat’s in-view rate benchmark by up to 17%², demonstrating the value of Reddit’s advertising. “Verified, third party measurement is the foundation of meaningful campaign reporting and we’re committed to helping brands of all sizes understand and optimize their advertising spend,” said Mark Kopera, Head of Product for Moat by Oracle Data Cloud. “Viewability measurement is one of the most commonly requested metrics and we’re excited to once again collaborate with Reddit to provide its growing advertiser base with the clarity and confidence to get the most from their campaigns.” How it works In addition to performance metrics that are readily available for partners in Reddit’s own dashboard, this custom integration will provide independent, third-party reporting by Moat. Advertisers who have an existing relationship with Moat will be able to access their Reddit data via their own Moat dashboard. Reddit will provide Moat reports to advertisers who do not have an existing relationship but would still like access to this additional layer of reporting. “There is an ongoing need for third party verification to ensure advanced advertiser controls in the marketplace,” said Omnicom Media Group Managing Director of Market Intelligence and Innovation Ben Hovaness. “Reddit and Omnicom Media Group share similar perspectives when it comes to transparency around reach and awareness, and this latest integration is another step towards ensuring a safe, effective place for advertisers to activate.” What’s to come? As the Reddit Ads platform evolves, we are continuing to explore ways to help advertisers effectively engage with our passionate communities and reach our millions of users. Through our collaboration with Moat, we will continue to measure viewability with advertisers and look forward to expanding the offering to include video views in the coming months.

Video is increasingly core to how people want to connect, and as we continue to grow our community, we’re committed to providing the best possible tools users need to find, create, and interact with one another through video. We are excited to announce that Reddit has acquired short-form video social platform Dubsmash. Dubsmash’s mission is to elevate under-represented creators. They have built a beautiful and fun product that enables their users to create unique, dynamic, interactive content. While Dubsmash will maintain its own platform and brand, we also look forward to bringing our teams together to combine the unique creator experience of Dubsmash with the community growth engine of Reddit. Dubsmash will bring two key strengths to Reddit. First, Dubsmash’s mission is unique among social platforms, and is aligned with Reddit’s own mission of bringing community and belonging to everyone in the world. Just as Reddit is a place for content you won’t see anywhere else on the Internet, Dubsmash provides a welcoming platform for creators and users who are under-represented in social media. Second, we will integrate Dubsmash’s innovative video creation tools into Reddit, which will empower Reddit’s own creators to express themselves in original and authentic ways that are endemic to our communities. Dubsmash’s communities are driven by young, diverse creators—about 25 percent of all Black teens in the U.S. are on Dubsmash, and females represent 70 percent of users. About 30 percent of users log in every day to create video content, indicating a high level of retention and engagement, and Dubsmash enables more than one billion video views per month, demonstrating the strength of its communities. Reddit first launched native video in 2017. Since then, we’ve seen tremendous growth and organic community adoption of video as it has become a significant part of how redditors create and connect. With the introduction of RPAN, streaming video has become a vibrant staple in our communities, unearthing original music, impressive artworks, talented creators, and more. Redditors have posted millions of videos, increasing 2X in 2020. “Both Reddit and Dubsmash share a deep rooted respect for how communities come together,” said Steve Huffman, CEO, Reddit. “Dubsmash elevates under-represented creators, while Reddit fosters a sense of community and belonging across thousands of different topics and passions. It’s clear that our missions closely align and that our community-focused platforms can coexist and grow as we learn from each other.” “In our years of building Dubsmash, we’ve learned how video can spark creativity, unlock interactions, and deepen connections within communities” said Suchit Dash, Head of Dubsmash. “We want to continue our journey to bring best in class video products to our users, and now Reddit users. We believe in the idea of connecting creators around interests and topics, something Reddit has pioneered, in our growing Dubsmash community.” We are excited to welcome Dubsmash’s entire team—including the three co-founders, Suchit Dash, Jonas Drüppel, and Tim Specht—to Reddit, starting immediately, and look forward to building better experiences for creative communities."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddits-2020-year-in-review-community-reflections","date":"2020-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Reddit’s 2020 Year in Review – Community Reflections","text":"At Reddit, our mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. In a year marked by the pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests, and other global events that impacted communities across Reddit, our moderators played a key role in fostering that belonging within their communities and beyond – from participating in mod councils that helped inform product and policy changes, to working with us to help defend the future of the internet, and on a pilot exchange program on the moderator experience. Moderators across a number of communities also had to address some of the year’s most difficult challenges, and helped foster spaces for Reddit users to find support, education, advice, and community. Here, moderators of r/coronavirus, r/blacklivesmatter, r/weddingplanning, r/frugal, r/applyingtocollege, and r/amitheasshole share firsthand how online communities faced some of 2020’s most unprecedented moments: Interview with u/secretagenticebat, u/flyingdutchman1337, u/burrshotfirst1804, u/dnahelicase, u/justcool393, u/mz063 r/coronavirus emerged as the largest community dedicated to COVID-19, providing reliable and fact-checked information to Reddit users looking for information on coronavirus. The community is the #3 top-growing community in 2020 (by activity). u/secretagenticebat: “I joined in January. We honestly had only 1,000 people. No one in science was involved with these conversations online. At that point it was less seeing misinformation as it was seeing unanswered questions and answering them.”u/dnahelicase: “We were moderating r/chinaflu and r/coronavirus – originally r/chinaflu was the more strict science-y one and r/coronavirus was memes. We petitioned to switch this because the real name of the virus is the one we should be using. We decided as a mod team to do what we call the Swappening, where we swapped the subs’ goals (and got promotion help from Reddit). We went from around 250,000 subscribers to 800,000 in a day.” Some of the moderators are also scientists — providing Reddit users with accurate, well-sourced information and resources about viruses, public health, and scientific progress. u/secretagenticebat: “u/burrshotfirst1804, u/dnahelicase and I are scientists. We talk about how viruses work, how public health measures work. I dig through sources and have been in research for a while. I’ve found at least two occasions where an article cites down to a publication that doesn’t exist.” u/justcool393: “We wrote a bot to remove opinion articles.”u/dnahelicase: “Everyone is seeing how science progresses real-time now. And some are going against scientists because they don’t understand that this is how it works. We change our opinions as evidence grows.” The community recognized a need for a space dedicated to regional and international discussion — and several other subreddits have spun out of r/coronavirus as a result. u/burrshotfirst1804: “Policy, not politics. Coronavirus is a global pandemic; it’s not a U.S. pandemic. We changed the flairs to regional flairs instead of topical flairs. We also promote regional subs (state- and country-specific)… r/covid19 is the scientific discussion sub.”u/dnahelicase: “We have r/covidsupport, for people who have anxiety and depression; it’s not official therapy, but it helps. We have r/covidprojects, which is people building ventilators, 3d projects, data trackers.”u/flyingdutchman1337: “We’re trying to separate politics from actual news in the subreddit, which can be a big challenge especially with the U.S. election. There is big debate on the sub around Sweden — people in favor of or against the policies they’re currently implementing.” r/coronavirus attracted the attention of government officials, university researchers… and even Bill Gates. u/Mz603: “The most memorable moment for me was the Bill Gates AMA and the conspiracies that came out of that. The microchip thing was huge. It was interesting to see that AMA blow up.” u/dnahelicase: “We’ve had numerous doctors, nurses, researchers, the mayor of Istanbul, and even Arnold Schwarzenegger have participated in our sub. We got a lot of requests from researchers from universities who wanted to post their survey, so we made a megathread to put them all in one place. We’ve gotten an amazing response to it. We’re at a total of 170+ studies from different universities, from Harvard to Stanford to universities from the Netherlands, Finland, Slovenia, Spain and more.” Reddit users flock to the community to discuss their fears, concerns, and anger around the pandemic — and look for support. u/dnahelicase: “In March and April, there was interest and fear. Now, people are apathetic.”u/justcool393: “Everyone is tired and angry.”u/burrshotfirst1804: “We get a lot of lockdown vs not-lockdown conversations these days. They blame other people for why it’s still bad. They’re venting. A lot of people talk about the vaccine: do they trust it, is it effective?”u/secretagenticebat: “Once it got to the U.S., everything changed. But it’s changing all the time; it’s completely made up as we go. That’s the only way we can do it, it’s an unprecedented situation. It’s not something that’s been done on Reddit before. It’s a constant conversation.” Interview with u/TheYellowRose r/blacklivesmatter was created in 2014, but experienced massive growth in activity in 2020 (9972.4% YoY). “This year, the George Floyd protests have definitely been the catalyst for huge growth in the subreddit and better conversation. Before George Floyd, every time there was an incident, we had a couple of people come over to read the news, but they never really stayed. We were outnumbered in the comments by trolls and racists. I put out a call for more mods in r/blackladies and only recruited people I knew were black and knew would do a good job. Our mods are passionate and very good at what they do.” After the murder of George Floyd, users came to the community to look for and offer ways for others to get involved with the movement. “After George Floyd, people were like, ‘I’m scared to protest right now because of COVID, what can I do?’ We’d give them resources; the top sticky post on the sub right now is “What people can do.” Call your representatives, vote, donate to causes you want. If you don’t have the money to donate, you can use a browser extension [Tab for a Cause] that will let you choose a cause to donate money to. This is all still fairly fresh. It takes a lot more time. People will reach out with art that they’ve done, apps that they’ve created to help people protest effectively, which is really cool.” The mods have had to adjust the community’s tone as it grows — and vice versa. “There will be limited teaching; you should know some things before you step into our space. But we’re changing our stance every day as a team. We have to adapt to what’s going on and how people are interacting with us. When everything started, people wanted to learn. We didn’t want to be the space where we taught you about racism, so we’d send people to r/socialjustice101 and r/racism. Still, we see questions like “Is racism really real?” and we have links ready to show them. Police brutality specifically against black people is real and is a problem, and some people don’t believe it. We’ve had to change our stance on [the educating] a little bit.” The community fosters real conversations around the Black Lives Matter movement on Reddit… “My favorite post was from four months ago, the title was “My 67 year old white conservative grandfather called me and asked me to stop by because he has a couple questions.” He wanted to know “what is systemic racism?” and “how can I help fix it?” I love it because that’s what it’s about: It’s about making your grandpa talk, changing your grandpa’s mind because he’s gonna vote. Everybody’s just like, ‘I love your grandpa’ in the comments, it’s so cute. I remember a couple days after George Floyd, there was a post where the user is apologizing for not doing anything, and a bunch of people who felt the same way came and supported them. In the world we live in, we’re isolated, and if you don’t expose yourself to it you won’t see it. If the news doesn’t report on it, you’re not gonna see it. It’s not entirely your fault if you haven’t done something until now.” … And, more importantly, encourages users to show support IRL. “It’s not solely an American problem, it’s happening to black people all across the world. I want you to figure out ways you can help because I know that the feeling of powerlessness that a lot of us have, coupled with quarantine, really sucks. I don’t want you to get dragged down by it. I want you to be real about it and take action, and do something. I don’t want you to just sit and look at Reddit. Take what you learned from Reddit and go apply it to the real world.” Interview with u/carlyc999, u/ashtree_c, u/jortbru1299 The community is mostly for students, by students. u/jortbru1299: “The high school counselor to high school student ratio in some states is 900:1. We’re a resource for that, and that’s how I’ve ended up treating r/ApplyingToCollege. Students helping students is the predominant user group.”u/ashtree_c: “A majority of the people that answer questions are also students, but we also have verified admissions counselors that answer questions (two of our mods are professional admission counselors). People ask a lot of simple questions on the subreddit. Whenever I try to answer a question, I’m always surprised to already see 7 responses. It means people are willing to answer questions, and people are willing to ask questions as well, which can be hard to do on this kind of site.” u/carlyc999: “Our users are good at forming community and being really inclusive – saying to each other you can succeed anywhere; prestige isn’t everything.” r/applyingtocollege increased 55% in YoY activity, as more students turned to the community — from their homes — for both support and levity. u/carlyc999: “There has been an increase in kids talking about how their days went, or their stress for a test or their upcoming SAT, even traveling far to SAT centers because a lot are closed.” u/ashtree_c: “Our main user base is stressed-out high school seniors who have no in-person community to turn and talk about this stuff with. So it’s nice that this is a place for them to reach out to their peers all across the country, and relax a bit. People now are like, ‘I can’t go to my guidance counselor anymore, so I’ll have to go to Reddit.'”u/jortbru1299: “There’s more pressure because students can’t get extracurriculars because they can’t go out and volunteer at soup kitchens. You don’t have students taking on leadership positions at school because there are no positions to have.” Wednesdays are especially popular. u/ashtree_c: “We have Shitpost Wednesdays; we don’t allow meme posts on other days because it clogs the subreddit. It’s insanity that day, people posting memes about the college process. I feel like there has been a higher volume of posts this year. In the last year we doubled our subscribers. It’s been insane.” The community is a resource for students wanting to hear directly from admissions professionals… u/ashtree_c: “There have been more admissions professionals, counselors and officers from schools contacting us now. It might not be because of coronavirus specifically, but there’s more recognition from the admissions field that Reddit is a good place to go to engage with your students.” …but it also tackles more than just the college admissions process. u/ashtree_c: “There’s one user who I still keep in touch with today. We were talking about admissions questions, and at some point he asked, ‘Can I tell you some stuff that I don’t have anyone else to tell?’ We talked about his family and his struggles at school and how stressful this process was for him. That attitude is very prevalent in this community, especially because a lot of students are from two very different backgrounds – the group whose parents have no idea what’s going on with college, or whose parents are very active, to the point of tiger parent ideology.”u/jortbru1299: “I had one student who I had been helping pretty consistently, even before I was a mod, answering questions about the college experience, not just applying. Like, ‘What do I bring to college, what do I put in a dorm room, dealing with financial aid…’ These are all questions we welcome on the subreddit, but sometimes people feel more comfortable sharing in DMs.” Interview with u/flignir, u/snausagefest, u/phteven_j, u/meloetta, u/techiesgoboom, u/mary-anns-hammocks, u/tolguacha r/amitheasshole experienced a 53.7% increase in activity YoY, as Reddit users stayed home and flocked to the community for support, debate, and discussion — especially around the people closest to them. “We’ve definitely seen a big increase in traffic this year with more people staying home and with tensions higher than usual. People are having the same interpersonal conflicts they always have.” The mods partnered with u/Ebbie45, a domestic violence professional, to create a wiki page with resources for those in an unhealthy or abusive relationship. “We’ve seen many users showing a great deal of compassion for people in tough situations. In particular, due to the pandemic there have been a lot of users that have reached out to us wanting to know how they can help people stuck at home in an unhealthy relationship. One of the best things this subreddit can do is provide perspective, and that perspective can be especially valuable to someone in an unhealthy or abusive relationship. Users could message [the wiki page] to posters that they thought needed help. It’s been met with an incredibly positive response from our users.” Reddit users often update r/amitheasshole on how the community has impacted their lives and decisions, and mods shared with us a few from this year: The mods highlighted a few unforgettable r/amitheasshole discussions from 2020: Interview with mods from r/weddingplanning With mentions of postponing weddings spiking by 6600% in March, mods had to react quickly to an influx of COVID-related posts. “It seemed to be in the matter of a week or maybe even days that our community was overrun with posts about COVID-19 and whether to postpone or not. Moderating all of these posts within the community quickly became overwhelming for us.” Some of those decisions meant changing a lot about how the community was run. “We tried to monitor the community as a whole and make the best decisions for the highest number of users. It was VERY different than our normal operating procedure. We also have moderated for misinformation. Several of the moderators have substantive science backgrounds, including 2 biomedical PhDs, so we have done what we can to remove misinformation or correct misunderstandings. Luckily, we don’t get too much of this.”“As we discussed and made these huge decisions, we did it all with our community in mind. We wanted these changes to give our users a safe place to commiserate and share in their frustrations and assist one another, while trying to maintain the integrity of this wedding planning subreddit.” Wedditors (as users in the community are known) have had to face difficult decisions and ask a ton of questions. “At first it was pure panic, WHAT DO I DO. Do I cancel? Do I postpone? How do I do that? What will happen with our deposits? When do I postpone to – when will it be over? When do we pull the trigger? What do we do about these international guests? And the thing is that everyone is going through this. There’s nowhere for these couples to dump out to because everyone else is also freaking out about their personal or professional lives. There were also questions like: we need to get legally married. How do we do that with courthouses closed? How do we make the day special still?”“Now I find that the hard decisions surround how to still live and have this experience during the pandemic, regardless of how different that may be. So many brides and grooms have had their plans change or completely cancelled and had their power taken away from them due to COVID-19 and now the decisions are about how to take that power back in a safe and responsible way.” And faced with the uncertainty of their wedding plans, mods say they’ve seen more elopements and smaller weddings being posted in the community this year. Overall, the community provides a safe space and support system for wedditors. “Many of our users don’t feel they have any other place to talk about this. Their whole support network is stressed by the pandemic. In the face of death, long-term health side effects, job loss, financial ruin — it’s not necessarily appropriate to talk about your wedding issues with people who are suffering like that. But those complex feelings about weddings are real too, and deserve support from the right group of people. It’s like the ring theory of grief which really can be adapted to any stressful situation. You need to identify who’s closer to the issue and who is farther out, and give support in and vent outwards. Weddit is a place for them to get that support from other people in the same position. We hope it’s helpful.”“Right now I’m really finding that wedditors are looking for support from those going through the same things that they are. There are so many polarizing opinions on COVID, and many brides and grooms are looking for a place to vent with someone who understands exactly what they’re going through.” Interview with u/Vorokar, u/WarpSeven, u/tiggers_blood, u/dan958, u/x647, u/Hopeful_Optimism Discussions around frugality focused heavily on quarantine activities at the start of shelter-in-place. “Frugality is a broad topic that applies to optimizing resource allocation, and as individuals spent more time at home, the posts became centered around cooking, meal-prepping, sourdough bread baking, self-sufficiency, zero waste, gardening, online learning, and crafting/DIYing. In those months, our community began to sharpen their frugal sensibilities to become more self-sufficient and resilient.” The mods kept conversations tailored to frugality when possible… “We enacted a filter to manually approve COVID-19-related posts. Besides that, we didn’t adjust our moderation strategy much — if the posts were on topic and aligned with the rules of the subreddit, they stayed. Specifics about resource acquisition such as seeking additional money through unemployment benefits, the stimulus check, or side-jobs, while important, aren’t necessarily in line with being frugal. We generally pointed individuals to the appropriate subreddits depending on what they needed.” …But there were many Reddit users who came to r/frugal for the first time because of the pandemic. “Veteran frugalites” often helped them out. “We are always impressed and humbled by the positivity and generosity of our users, even in times of hardship such as during the pandemic. Take a look at this thread: “If you are lucky enough to stock on items for the coronavirus, please consider donating some to your local food pantry.” The discussion there is so altruistic and inspiring for readers. See the thread “New to frugal and foodstamps (thanks covid), wondering the best way to feed my brother?” So many of our community members offer recipes, advice, resources, and show of support to help out the OP.” The community celebrated major r/frugal wins together. “They will make thank you posts to the entire community; for example, one post is a celebration of getting rid of $30k in debt because of the habits promoted by redditors. Another post shared their whimsical tale of trying out a suggestion from r/frugal of using shop towels instead of paper towels. (Long story short, wash brand new shop towels before using them to help them reach full absorbing potential!)

In a year marked by life-changing, world-shifting and often tumultuous events, Reddit users came together in powerful ways that reverberated IRL, taught important lessons, and provided comfort throughout the pandemic. They also weren’t afraid to address some of the bigger issues that shaped 2020 — including those surrounding the U.S. election, Black Lives Matter, and climate change — or to show off their creative prowess. In this report, we’re taking a deeper look at some of these conversations and more, including two new additions for this year: UK Year in Review – We compiled our first-ever UK report, which looks at the year’s biggest topics, communities and trends across the pond.

December 13 marks the 10-year anniversary of one of Reddit’s most classic comments: u/rhoner’s “Today You, Tomorrow Me.” In response to an r/AskReddit post, Have you ever picked up a hitch-hiker?, u/rhoner shared the story of a family from Mexico that stopped to help him when his car broke down on the side of the freeway. Instead of taking his money as thanks, they shared their lunch. Then, the father left u/rhoner with these parting words: “Today you, tomorrow me,” inspiring u/rhoner and the many Reddit users who have read, awarded, and shared this story in the past decade to stop on the road to help others and, more importantly, be kind to strangers: “Just about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn’t too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road. This past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people’s cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel. Anyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn’t loan them out ‘for my safety’ but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like ‘this country is going to hell in a handbasket.’ But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me. He was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn’t careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck. No worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man’s hand but he wouldn’t take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had. So, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time is money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow… But we aren’t done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won’t take it. All I can think to say is ‘Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor’ with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English: ‘Today you…. tomorrow me.’ Rolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn’t deal. In the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won’t accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through: ‘Today you…. tomorrow me.’ tl;dr: long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general. I am sure it won’t be as meaningful to anyone else but it was seriously the highlight of my 2010.” – u/rhoner Ten Years Later When u/rhoner first commented on the post, he didn’t expect anyone to see it — by the next day, it had gone viral. Requests poured in to reprint his story, from national magazines to church newsletters. The comment also inspired films and music videos by dozens of artists, including this short film from fellow Reddit user Chris Neal, which premiered earlier this year. The impact of u/rhoner’s story continues to resonate with those who stumble upon it several years later. “They’re mostly the sweetest, most humbling notes about the writer’s personal stories of being helped or their pledges to try and be more helpful going forward. If I could box up all the well wishes and send them to the family that helped me, I would.” In the decade since he made the comment, u/rhoner has found new ways to stop on the road: “I live in an area with a great network of mutual aid organizations that I can lend some of my free time and resources to. With pandemic restrictions keeping us home more I am really focused on my neighborhood now more than ever.” Paying It Forward Reddit users often ask u/rhoner for advice on what they can do to help others, too. u/rhoner has a few ideas to share: Know (and help) your neighbors “Make sure you know your neighbors, keep an eye and ear out for needs that aren’t being met in your community, and remember to check in on people in your orbit that may not have the support they need, especially right now. People are generally very hesitant to ask for help so, when you see the opportunity, do the hard part for them, make the first move and ask how you can help.” Volunteer your time — in big and small ways “If you have a little free time on your hands consider volunteering once a month. If you have a lot of free time on your hands consider committing it on a regular, ongoing basis to a local organization that staffs itself with volunteer labor. You can pick up litter, donate to your library, support a local artist, write a letter to your congressional representatives, you can even help change a tire. Just find whatever it is you are comfortable with and give it a shot.” Take care of yourself “And if you don’t have the time, or energy, or bandwidth to help others right now know that’s ok, too. That’s the other half, the ‘Today you’ half. Your ‘tomorrow’ can be another day. Take the time to really care for yourself and, if you need help, don’t be too stubborn to reach out to someone and ask for it.”"},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-welcomes-paula-price-to-board-of-directors","date":"2020-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Reddit Welcomes Paula Price to Board of Directors","text":"Today, we’re pleased to welcome Paula Price as the newest member of Reddit’s Board of Directors.

The Contract is based on a set of principles that we believe aligns with the Reddit community. Reddit’s network of communities enable people to share their diverse passions, interests, and beliefs, and these communities have flourished largely because of the open internet. If we want to empower these communities and fulfill the original promise of the open internet, we must all commit to amplify its potential without shying away from its challenges. That is why Reddit has signed onto the Contract for the Web. The world today faces many challenges, and too often we see the internet misused or manipulated. We are at a tipping point and we all have a shared responsibility to build the internet we want to see. Hundreds of companies, governments, and civic groups have signed in support of the Contract and its principles.

Many of these communities have held in-depth discussions on politics throughout the year and today is the day to take those views to the ballot box. It’s Election Day here in the US, and we want to help make sure every voter who is registered and eligible to vote to get to the polls and make their voices heard (Psst… 21 states allow same-day voter registration if you haven’t already registered). We’ve put together some resources below to help you cast your ballot. Where do I vote? Your polling place is based on the address you live in and listed when you registered. You can find your polling place through your state’s elections office here. These state websites are the most complete resources for all your voting needs today. There are also many tools to find your polling place, check your voting hours, and even check accessible voting options in your state. The Healthy Voting Tool is one of the easiest to use. Do I need to already be registered to vote? And how can I see if I’m registered? It depends on your state. Some states allow for same-day registration, so you may still be able to vote even if you haven’t registered. You can check your state’s registration requirements here. In most cases, you’ll also be able to check your registration status on the same page. What do I need to bring with me? Some states require you to bring identification with you to the polls and some states don’t. You can see what your state’s requirements are here. If your state requires identification and you don’t have it, you may still be able to vote, so you should still go to the polls. Depending on your local laws, you may be able to cast a provisional ballot, show ID later, sign a form attesting your identity, or another method. Don’t assume that you cannot vote! What am I going to be voting on? Some people are surprised to find out when they get to the polls the sheer number of offices and issues they may be voting on. Don’t be caught unprepared! You can look up a sample ballot for your area to find out what you’ll be voting on so that you’re informed when you head into the voting booth. You can even print out your sample ballot and take it to the poll with you so you can keep track of how you want to vote. I have a disability or language barrier. Can I still vote? Yes! There are federal laws in place to ensure that all eligible Americans can vote. You can learn more about your rights and the accommodations you are entitled to here. Someone is trying to prevent me from voting or is deliberately spreading disinformation about voting. What should I do? Intimidating voters, trying to influence votes through threats or coercion, or attempting to suppress voters, including through misinformation campaigns, is against the law. If you witness such behavior, report it to the Election Protection hotline at 1-866-OUR-VOTE. If you see suspected voter suppression attempts on Reddit (e.g. efforts to deliberately misinform people about voting so that they won’t vote, or so that their vote might not count), report it to the admins here. Happy voting, Reddit!"},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/evolving-reddits-workforce","date":"2020-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Life at Reddit"],"title":"Evolving Reddit’s Workforce","text":"Earlier this year, Reddit had to evolve with the unexpected challenge of going 100% remote. Our employees, or Snoos as we’re known, rose to the occasion, adapting our business and the way we work together quickly to help Reddit come out stronger on the other side. Evolve is one of our company values and we have always challenged ourselves to continuously make our culture and work experience better. Looking ahead, we want to meet the needs of our employees so they can do their best work, especially in a time of uncertainty. And as we deliver on our mission of creating belonging for everyone in the world, we want Reddit to be positioned as a workforce that’s as diverse as its ecosystem of communities and users. Moving forward, teams and team members will have flexibility to explore where they work: in the office, remotely, or a combination of the two. There are some exceptions; we have some roles at Reddit that need to be performed from our offices or specific geographic locations, such as Facilities or IT Support. Ultimately, we empower our leaders and their teams to make those decisions, balancing the needs of the business and employees. What does it mean in practice? Some team members will want to move away from a Reddit office and if they can be effective while remote, we will be supportive of the move—and won’t adjust their compensation down (we’ll talk more about that in a bit).Reddit will be able to find and hire more amazing talent wherever they live, opening up more meaningful opportunities for diversity.And our leaders will create virtual and in-person (once it’s safe to do so) interactions to build culture and foster trust, collaboration, and innovation among their teams and across Reddit. What about employee compensation? To help drive the idea home (pun intended), we’ve reimagined our approach to compensation in the US. To support employees to live where they want to and do their best work, we are eliminating geographic compensation zones in the US. It means that our US compensation will be tied to pay ranges of high-cost areas such as SF and NY, regardless of where employees live. We believe this is the right balance of flexibility and support for employees, recognizing the varied tradeoffs people consider when deciding where to live. Internationally, we have had one pay range per country, and now the US will be consistent with this approach. And offices? Culture? The proverbial “water cooler”? We are reimagining the future of our office space to support those team members who will be in the office 1-5 days per week. Imagine: casual and coffee shop-style seating, private space for heads-down focusing, larger bookable resources and collaboration spaces for teams to strategically meet IRL, and no more fixed desks—we’ll have neighborhoods for teams to gather and bookable desks for employees working in the office. To make this all work, we are focusing on creating processes, workflows, and a culture that supports employees being distributed and remote to drive productivity and build connection, belonging, trust, and alignment. What are the benefits of this approach? There are many upsides to this approach, across talent attraction, retention, diversity, inclusion, belonging, and more. We believe that providing more flexibility will increase our ability to: Attract top talent by not requiring people to relocate and increase the diversity of our workforce in the process.Drive employee engagement and productivity by meeting our Snoos’ needs. Manage existing office space more efficiently to foster collaboration and connection. There are some downsides, of course, like not being physically together as frequently, but we’re confident that by leaning into creating meaningful moments of connection and doubling down on processes to support a more distributed workforce, the pros will greatly outweigh the cons. As our teams become more distributed, we will have many learnings about the impact of this model on our performance as a business. We will not be afraid to continuously adapt and evolve our workforce philosophies, programs, and processes. 2020 is an unprecedented year, and we strongly believe that for the foreseeable future, providing flexible work arrangements to our current and future Snoos is the right thing to do for Reddit."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/the-internets-largest-collaborative-canvas-returns-to-reddit-with-r-layer-season-two-in-partnership-with-adobe","date":"2020-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"The Internet’s Largest Collaborative Canvas Returns to Reddit with r/Layer ‘Season Two’ in Partnership with Adobe","text":"Reddit is home to some of the most creative online communities, boasting more than 430M active users who contribute more than 100k original artworks on the platform every month. And today we are so excited to announce the ultimate creative collaboration with the return of r/Layer, the world’s largest real-time digital art installation. r/Layer ‘Season Two’ is live for five days, in partnership with Adobe. r/Layer Season 2 in partnership with Adobe Back by Popular Demand Returning for its second year, r/Layer is a collaboration between Adobe and Reddit, inspired by the layers used in Adobe’s Creative Cloud products. When it first launched in September 2019, it quickly became Reddit’s fastest-growing community, with thousands of redditors from around the world flocking to create, collaborate and contribute to the evolving work of art. Ultimately, more than 200k users engaged with r/Layer, creating more than 150k layers by the end of the five-day period. It became one of Reddits’ most successful brand partnerships of 2019 — and within minutes of last year’s activation closing, users were begging for its return. Last Year’s r/Layer Canvas Introducing r/Layer Season Two This year, r/Layer returns for ‘Season Two,’ with new features and even more ways for users to make their mark on digital art history. Where last year’s r/Layer experience provided a single canvas, this year, r/Layer will include 10 themed canvases, inspired by some of Reddit’s most beloved communities. From the Aww canvas for all things cute, to the Threads canvas for fashion mavens, and the NomNom canvas for our foodie redditors, this year’s canvases aim to ignite creativity and collaboration across a wide range of passions and interests. “What started as a campaign to raise awareness of Adobe’s creative products aimed at students quickly evolved into one of the most vibrant and engaging brand partnerships we’ve seen on the platform,” said Reddit’s VP of Marketing, Roxy Young. “r/Layer’s biggest strength is that it encourages people from all over the world to come together to create — regardless of distinct passions and artistic styles, there’s a place on the canvas for everyone. Last year’s r/Layer activation saw redditors work solo, together and sometimes at odds to create a breathtaking celebration of color, culture and creativity, and I can’t wait to see what Season Two inspires, with its bigger and better format.” How it Works r/Layer Season Two is available to all redditors for five days starting today, via the r/Layer community, which will house the 10 canvases. Users can select the canvases they’d like to contribute to and choose an area on the canvas for their drawing. From there, the artwork will zoom into a 500×500 square and open the creativity tool, so the creation can begin. Once complete, the drawing will be added to the digital masterpiece, which will continue updating in real time as users add more. Creating a Layer: The User Interface r/Layer Season Two will again encourage users to engage with existing layers on each of the canvases using Reddit’s iconic upvote and downvote system; and for the first time this year, the layers that receive the highest number of upvotes will “move to front,” or appear towards the front of the canvas, so that all redditors can champion the creativity of others. “At Adobe, we know that creativity brings people together. We are excited about the revival of our hugely successful Reddit partnership in which creators can place their own unique layer on a blank digital canvas on Reddit, resulting in a beautiful community tapestry at a time when community is more important than ever,” said Adobe Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Ann Lewnes. The activation is supported by Front Page Takeovers and Promoted Posts from Adobe throughout the five days and beyond. r/Layer Season Two is live on Reddit 24 hours a day, from Monday, October 19 at 10am PST through Friday October 23 at 5pm PST.

The new engineer fidgeted in his seat. “This is easy, right?” he thought, worriedly. “It can’t break anything either, because it’s just events. Those don’t even really matter.” He went ahead with the deploy, hastily jamming them into an already overloaded function, eager to get the change out before the 4-day weekend. Although the work week was short, it had felt long and his bleary eyes needed rest. What he did not know, and could not know, was that a storm was brewing on the horizon… The Very Next Day It was day 1 of vacation. The engineer rolled out of bed and checked his email. One subject caught his eye: Missing event data. “Hrm, that can’t be good,” he thought. “Probably not a big deal though.” He debated ignoring it and going on with his weekend, but something compelled him to check. “400k exceptions per day in the bug tracker!” Oh no, no, this was bad. Where were these errors yesterday? In a panic, he reached out to his manager, apologizing profusely for the interruption on a day off. He just didn’t know what to do. His manager tried to calm him down, encouraging him to fix the problem next Tuesday as long as the impact on users was minimal. “That’s right! I’ll confirm user signups are fine. That’s the flow this touches and the only possible user impact. I’m sure they’re fine,” he thought. He navigated to the Reddit homepage and proceeded to sign up. 500 error. He tried again: *another* 500 error. He tried on mobile: *more* 500 errors. With panic rising throughout his body and mind, he jumped into the outage tracking company Slack channel. The first message that greeted him: “As noted in the hangout, signups are probably broken right now.” “Oh…oh no,” he thought as a scream lodged in his throat. “I’ve taken down all Reddit signups for the entire weekend!” he panicked. As he frantically scrolled the Slack message history, the clouds began to part: this was unrelated. There was a database error. Something something queue. Something something replicas. He decided to double-check the code. His event errors, while very troubling, weren’t blocking sign-ups. He heaved a huge sigh of relief. “It’s not my fault!” he rejoiced. And it wasn’t…this time. The Haunted Firebase Migration By Tanzeela Khan (u/tanzealous) Reddit iOS’s crash reporting service, Fabric, was getting axed in three weeks. A bright-eyed new grad was ordered to carry out the execution. She was further tasked with replacing it with a new crash reporting service called Firebase. The young engineer tread through the ominous documentation and applied the necessary changes to the codebase. “It works on my machine!” she declared, shipping the code to production. During a team meeting on Monday, she checked in on the shiny new crash reporter, Firebase. Woah, crash reports were at 0%! Did Reddit achieve the impossible? Unfortunately, the news was much worse: the Firebase update had gone completely wrong and crash reports were no longer being sent. That meant that any and all crashes were undetected and unresolved. With haste, the young engineer rolled back the Firebase update. Time was running out, there were only two weeks before the old crash reporting service would stop working completely. With her detective hat on, she got to work on identifying the root issues. Soon, a couple of concerns stood out. The first oddity she discovered was that the production build of the iOS application was not actually using production configuration at all! It was using test configurations— configurations that would only work on a developer’s machine. Surprisingly, the Firebase docs were not quite up to date and this was one of its unpredictable kinks. The second issue was that Firebase’s new service required the “dead” API key, otherwise known as the secret password assigned to Reddit from Fabric’s former service! “You never really do get over ghosts from the past.” The young coder modified the configuration in order to appease the Fabric-ghost-of-crash-reporting-past. Isolated in her apartment, she meticulously tested each configuration, forcing crashes on all versions of the app. What made this entire process FAR more frustrating was that each crash test took 40 minutes to complete. Between each test, the engineer would make a small change and wait for the test results to return. If they failed, it took another 40 minutes to try an alternative fix. This was too fast to complete a context switch onto another task, yet too slow to watch. While undergoing developer wait-time and context-switching torture, she found satisfaction at seeing the app burn again and again and again. After ritualistic testing, she marked the changes ready to ship. Another Monday rolled in, except this time, the engineer jumped with glee as 40k crashes came rolling in. As her screen filled with error upon error, the engineer sipped her tea rejoicing at her success. The Button By Saurabh Sharma (u/foklepoint) It was mid-day in the office, the sun shining brightly in the city. But somewhere in this same city was a man, sitting in front of a glowing screen in an office dark as night. It was time for The Ritual of the Configuration Change Deploy with a set of new Amazon autoscaling group servers, which were forged for this very special occasion of testing the new configuration. With such attention, the meticulous programmer prepared. With such care, he executed the change. Little did it matter, though. The new servers came up fraught with errors, exceptions spewed across the terminal screen, dashboards bled with red 5xx errors, overtaking the restful green of successful responses. But not all was lost! Our quick-witted engineer prepared a plan to remove the new servers with the ill-conceived configuration, to restore glory to the Front Page of the Internet to the world. In a rush and with gusto, the engineer made a change to the termination policy in the Amazon web console that dictated: “Kill the newest instances first,” hoping to rid the world of the diseased servers. The programmer was ready. With haste, he went to kill all the new servers. Only little did he know, a button that read ‘Save Policy,’ hid below the fold and his termination policy made no impact. The default termination policy stated to kill the servers that had been with the autoscaling group the longest. That was the day mobile web flatlined for 30 minutes and engineers scrambled to resuscitate the Front Page of the Internet. The Mystery Commit By Hannah Hagen (u/tinkywinky10) “Hey, do you mind not merging my pull requests?” my coworker asks pointedly. I was confused. He continued, “I requested your review but you just immediately merged them.” I stammered an apology, embarrassed that I had made a mistake like that. I didn’t remember merging his pull request, but then again, it was Monday morning and last week felt draped in a haze. Still, it was itching at me so I checked the Git Log. Indeed, at 11:33pm PST on Friday I had merged his pull request. “Wait a minute,” I thought to myself, “Friday, late at night, I was snoring in a sleeping bag in the middle of a national forest, miles away from any cell reception!” A shadow cast across my face. Had I been hacked? What else had this hacker done? I checked my GitHub activity. Nothing. What if they have access to our infrastructure? But then the green check marks from the passing CICD build glowed upon my face. I clicked the glowing green mark. In the build, I saw code running that programmatically committed back to the repo… as my user. A malicious hacker had not impersonated me, our own code had! That is the day my identity was stolen by a CICD pipeline."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/today-is-the-first-ever-vote-early-day","date":"2020-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Today is the First-Ever Vote Early Day!","text":"It’s Vote Early Day today!

As with anything in its teenage years, behaviors and circumstances change. Reddit’s system architecture is no different. With more users throughout the years, we’ve hired more engineers, which translates to more deployments and more intricate codebases. By consolidating and evolving our Infrastructure to be consistent within Reddit, engineers are now able to abstract away some processes and focus primarily on their services, thanks to Kubernetes. Services Before Kubernetes Let’s begin by going over the structure of service deployments outside of Kubernetes. These deployments run on VMs in EC2 Auto-Scaling Group, in which you can see a few components (see diagram above) that make up the service framework that developers use.The Application process handles all of the request/response and business-level logic of the service. In order to better utilize the CPU resources of EC2 VMs, we run multiple copies of Application servers, per VM, and manage them with Einhorn to fulfill multiple requests. Sidecar processes abstract the common dependencies that Reddit applications need – telemetry for sending metrics and event data, live configuration fetching for experiment coordination and secrets, and service discovery for managing service-to-service communications. These processes coordinate communication with shared systems that are accessible by all services. We manage service deployments in this model by using Terraform to declare the underlying AWS resources and Puppet to manage the bootstrapping of the service EC2 host from a shared base AMI. There are a few other pieces not discussed here, but the key takeaway is that the sidecar model of deploying these dependencies keeps the application lightweight by focusing on a specific task and also allows for isolated development of other sidecars without impacting all services. Services on Kubernetes Developers have grown to rely on the models from EC2-based deployments for their application, so maintaining these abstractions was critical when architecting a standard service workload on Kubernetes. The above shows what a standard service workload looks like. Another peek at the diagram and we can also see some dependencies and their communication with services outside of the Kubernetes cluster. Each service runs in its own Namespace, allowing us to easily map team permissions for services that share an underlying cluster. The Kubernetes Deployment and ReplicaSet constructs mapped nicely to our previously understood notions of Auto-Scaling Groups. A ReplicaSet manages a set of Pods, where each pod runs one instance of the Application and some sidecars. In EC2 VMs, all of the sidecars run alongside the Application. When re-architecting to Kubernetes, we wanted to rethink some of the colocation to make deployments more efficient where we could. One major consideration was the interface between some of the sidecars and the Application. In the first iteration, we opted to reduce the complexity of the workload configuration by running sidecars that needed shared underlying resources as containers within the same Pod. This enabled us to support simpler Kubernetes workload configurations for the first pass of service rollouts. Removing friction like Terraform and Puppet also made it much easier to deploy common services like metrics aggregators on a per-service level, allowing developers to specifically configure their metrics for our monitoring and alerting systems. There’s a lot more that goes into how these workloads are defined and managed from an infrastructure perspective, so keep an eye out for future posts about this! For now, let’s dive into a case study for an internal Reddit service. A K8S Migration Story In Reddit Ads, we have a backend service called Campaign Management (CM), which makes up a key part of our Ads platform. On the Ads platform, advertisers can create and modify their campaigns. For historic reasons, the Reddit Ads system designs have stayed pretty distinct and isolated from consumer Reddit. So, when services on reddit.com transitioned to Kubernetes, Ads fell behind. However, to initiate the standardization of Kubernetes services in Ads, our team decided to migrate CM onto Kubernetes, which also enabled us to leverage internal Infrastructure tools like Starlark resource generation. We enlisted the help of teams all over Reddit to get the job done. Setup Components First, we needed to add components to our project to integrate with the new Kubernetes workflow, including: Setting up a container environment for the Application (using Docker)Configuring a build and deployment system for deploying to a Kubernetes clusterWriting Kubernetes resource definitions for the components CM would need Setting Up the Application Environment Reddit services default to run development and production containers with Docker, and we save Docker images on an Amazon EC2 Container Registry. For our CM migration, we configured our repo to push any docker images to the new ECR environment. Configuring the Deployment Process Drone is Reddit’s Continuous Integration (CI) system. Drone uploads resources for deployments and prompt downstream events. In our service’s Drone configuration file, we defined actions and events that should be triggered. For instance, when someone commits to the repository, Drone runs the linter and executes tests. The actual deployment pipeline configuration is detailed in a Starlark file. This pipeline file tells Spinnaker where and how to connect Kubernetes resources during a deployment. Add K8S Resource Generation In order to run on Kubernetes, we transformed the application into a Kubernetes workload. This is where we declared sidecars, jobs, consumers, autoscaling numbers, and other application resources and requirements for our environments. Before this service migration, each Kubernetes service consisted of a helm chart that defined the service workload, which was tedious to understand and update for minor changes. Coincidentally, at the time of our migration, Reddit Infrastructure was in its early stages of adopting an automatic resource generator known as Starlark. Starlark allowed us to easily and Pythonicly define our Kubernetes YAML in a manifest file. Connecting Existing Services The CM service talks with many other services in the Reddit ecosystem: Ads API which is our ads platform routing middlemanBilling which sends out invoices and bills advertisers’ funding instrumentsAds Serving which selects ads to show to usersAds Reporting which reports on how campaigns are performing Because the CM service was live in production, we updated all connection paths, in real time, to point to this new K8S service. The Ads platform spans different teams and environments, so we had to account for Kubernetes services in same and different clusters, service discovery for services that were still on a legacy environment, and finally cron jobs. This was no stress-free feat. The first service we decided to migrate was our Ads API. Because our team worked directly with it and had permissions, we could access the cluster to view logs, and perform other kubernetes commands from it. Unfortunately, during this migration, we did run into a snafu where the service discovery was not set correctly since the Ads API was on a different cluster than where CM is deployed to, but we reverted and deployed a fix within minutes. With the Ads API migrated over, we decided to migrate billing next. From the CM – API migration, we learned that we should try hitting a CM endpoint from the receiving service to confirm that the connection is discoverable. As the API and billing services are served from the same clusters, we could easily replicate the previous process. Hence, we looped in a Billing Team member who successfully hit an endpoint and we seamlessly connected them to the new K8S CM service. To migrate the Ads Serving and Reporting jobs, we collaborated with Ads Infra to configure and determine the correct host and ports to expose for CM. This task was tricky because our team was not familiar with ads-specific infrastructure, let alone with other team’s code which is written in different programming languages. Deciphering new-to-us codebases and where to make our changes was challenging in itself. Then, we had to figure out how to deploy the changes without taking down the ads serving pipeline. Fortunately, we worked with relevant service owners and devised a plan, which included saving the job configurations before and after our changes, so we could easily revert if needed. It truly takes a village. Throughout this entire migration, we received help from main Infra, Ads Infra, Ads Serving, and the Billing teams. Without these cross-team conversations and check ins, we could have experienced longer downtimes and considerable monetary consequences. What’s Next A major advantage of Kubernetes is abstracting away parts of a system for an engineer. As Reddit operates more services on Kubernetes, each service owner will be able to more efficiently work and debug their code on their own. In the near future, we hope to see all other web services at Reddit adopt and run on this shared platform.

We also suggest you check out some of the thriving Latinx communities on Reddit, who are constantly discussing different aspects of Latin and Hispanic culture in their own unique ways. r/asklatinamericar/DosXXLatinasr/LatinAmericar/LatinoPeopleTwitterr/latinoamerica r/AskTheCaribbeanr/Hispanicr/brasilivrer/portugueses To stay up to date with all the happenings at Reddit, Inc., check out the Life at Reddit section of our Reddit Blog."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-launches-london-operation-with-mission-to-grow-uk-community-and-advertising-business","date":"2020-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Reddit for Business"],"title":"Reddit Launches London Operation with Mission to Grow UK Community and Advertising Business","text":"Today, we’re excited to announce Reddit’s expansion into the UK in an effort to bring community and belonging to more redditors and advertisers in the market. Home to our second largest user base and growing at nearly 70%¹ in the past year, the UK is core to our international vision and growth strategy as we scale Reddit’s advertising business globally, and attract new users to the platform. Our new London team, based out of Holborn, is already servicing local partners, and is now officially open for business. The business is headed by Reddit’s newly appointed Head of International, Tariq Mahmoud, formerly Head of International Sales and Strategy at Roku, who is responsible for growing the company outside the United States. Opening Shop in the UK Globally, Reddit brings together more than 430M active users across more than 130,000 active communities with varying passions, purposes and interests. From the dedicated football fans of r/PremierLeague to the irreverent humour and quirky conversation found in r/CasualUK, Reddit’s UK-based communities have something for everyone — one of the reasons Reddit is already a Top 5 most visited website in the UK. Our expansion will focus on extending community and belonging to even more users in this market, while providing brands and advertisers the means to engage directly with the internet’s most passionate audiences. Samsung, Netflix, PlayStation and Pringles are just some of the leading brands already working with our UK team to find their home on Reddit. “Our mission at Reddit is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. Brands looking to engage in an authentic and interesting way can be a part of this mission too, tapping into our 430M+ active users in the process,” said Reddit Chief Operating Officer, Jen Wong. “With a dedicated team now fully operational in the UK, ambitious growth plans for 2021 and increased interest from local brands to be part of the Reddit community, we are primed to service the UK advertising market with best-in-class campaigns that cut through.” Reddit’s unique offering for UK advertisers Reddit’s users can’t be found anywhere else online and provide a level of insight into consumer perception that isn’t possible on other platforms. 26% of UK redditors aren’t on Instagram and 48%² are not on Snapchat. At 33 minutes per day³, UK users spend more time on Reddit than nearly every other social platform, and our audience skews young, with 68%⁴ aged between 18 – 34. Our UK user base is almost 40% female⁵, and has a higher household income⁶ than the UK national average. Our new UK team is committed to meeting the needs of local clients and connecting more brands with this unduplicated audience of highly engaged consumers. A welcome home for UK brands A recent study of UK-based community site users found that 75%⁷ would be receptive towards brand participation with an online community, which aligns with what we’re seeing globally: that almost 70%⁸ of Redditors respect brands that make an effort to participate on the platform. What’s more, 61%⁹ of Reddit users are more likely to trust a brand that does participate on Reddit, while 66%¹⁰ of our users say brands can have conversations with them on Reddit that they can’t have anywhere else. “The power of Reddit is in its informed and passionate communities – these are social media users who are actively seeking rather than aimlessly scrolling and this creates an extremely valuable environment for brands to connect and engage where interest is already baked in,” said Reddit VP of Advertising, Harold Klaje, who oversees Reddit’s global sales business. “It is so exciting to be bringing this opportunity to UK advertisers along with a local team whose sole purpose is to find brands of all sizes and across all industries, the perfect home on Reddit.” Some of these brands are already seeing the benefits of engaging on Reddit, including Samsung, which leveraged our Takeover and Promoted Post products to launch the Galaxy Note 20 in June. “We are really excited to be partnering with Reddit for the first time, as it’s a key platform for our core audience,” said Samsung UK Social Media Lead Roseanna Burns. “The results of our takeover campaign were outstanding, and we look forward to working with Reddit on future campaigns.” Reddit is officially open for business in the UK.

And as we continue evolving the Reddit Ads platform to meet the needs of advertisers, we’re excited to start providing more flexibility, choice and control over the type of content brands appear adjacent to and the audiences they reach. Today, Reddit is pleased to announce the launch of Inventory Types, a new feature that offers advertisers three tiers of inventory to choose from, based on their individual campaign objectives, brand safety requirements, and targeting goals. Why Inventory Types? Reddit is home to many types of advertisers, all of which have different needs when it comes to their brand message and campaign objective. While Reddit has previously offered the same set of inventory to all advertisers with universal brand safety controls, Inventory Types recognizes that no two advertisers are the same, and provides greater choice to meet these unique needs across three different tiers. About Inventory Types Starting today, Reddit will offer three tiers of inventory to accommodate different advertiser needs: Expanded Inventory: Where advertisers can access Reddit’s maximum inventory pool and appear next to the broadest range of content. This new tier will open up more than 20% more communities for targeting, giving advertisers access to a significantly larger user base via inventory that continues to meet Reddit’s content standardsStandard Inventory: Our recommended setting that provides balanced reach and protection to fit the needs of most advertisersLimited Inventory: In partnership with Oracle Data Cloud’s contextual intelligence, this tier provides the strictest brand safety measures with more controlled reach through an added layer of 3rd party verification that gives greater control to advertisers with brand suitability concerns Regardless of the tier, Reddit’s strict platform, community and campaign moderation system is foundational and applies to all Inventory Types. Ads on Reddit can only appear in communities on our hand-curated allowlist, and all advertisers will continue to have the choice to enable or disable comments on their ads, as well as exclude certain keywords and communities based on their individual preferences. Brand Safety has become a broader and more ubiquitous issue in recent months, and with good reason. With the sheer volume of content that appears across UGC platforms, it’s understandable that some advertisers desire enhanced control, while others are more comfortable with this environment,” said Reddit Chief Operating Officer, Jen Wong. “Our new Inventory Types feature gives control directly to our advertisers, allowing them to tailor their targeting and adjacency approach to serve their campaign’s unique needs — whether that’s tapping into even more communities, or focusing on a more controlled reach. Whatever the need, we’re committed to empowering our advertisers with more options, without compromising results.” How it Works Building on the first-of-its-kind collaboration between Reddit and Oracle Data Cloud, which launched in 2019 to help ensure advertiser control over ad adjacency, the Limited Inventory tier offers Reddit advertisers a lower but more controlled reach with an added layer of third-party filtering, thanks to Oracle’s contextual intelligence. “Our contextual intelligence technology provides up-to-the-minute content review and classification across industry-standard brand safety categories to give advertisers greater control over where their campaigns run,” said Oracle Data Cloud Senior Director of Product Management, Chris Stark. “This real-time control over advertising around user-generated content is a first-in-market offering and we are thrilled to be working with Reddit to bring brands greater peace of mind and ultimately, campaign success.” By contrast, Expanded Inventory will better meet the needs of performance advertisers seeking to reach as many redditors as possible without added restrictions on where their ads appear. Partner and Industry Response In recent months, more than 30 partners have tested Reddit’s Inventory Types across CPG, financial, health and wellness, gaming and QSR industries. Our agency partners have also been welcoming of the new feature and Reddit’s commitment to providing more optionality, confidence and increased brand safety guards for more risk-averse clients. “We are encouraged to see Reddit’s ongoing efforts to provide safer and more informed choices to advertisers with Inventory Types.” said GroupM Managing Partner – Head of Social, Amanda Grant. “Clients and advertisers alike find value in having more control over how — and where — they effectively reach their audiences, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with Reddit to meet these evolving needs.” Inventory Types is available for all Reddit advertisers starting today.

Register To Vote & Have Your Voice Heard In The 2020 Elections","text":"Today is National Voter Registration Day in the United States. Since its creation in 2012, nearly 3 million voters have registered to vote on this holiday. Redditors already know a thing or two about voting, but did you know that according to the US Census Bureau, only 67% of eligible voters were registered in 2018? IRL votes are the hallmark of a vibrant and participatory democracy, and although the 2020 election brings along unique challenges with the coronavirus, it also puts forward a wealth of online and offline tools that can help more Americans participate and get vote-ready. Here are some ways you can help ensure every vote counts this election: Register or check on your registration at Vote.gov and CanIVote.Org. Requirements and procedures vary by state, so be sure to select your state of residence in the dropdown. Even if you think you are registered already, it’s still a good idea to check your status since common life events like a move or a name change require re-registration.Make a plan for voting safely at healthyvoting.org. The Healthy Voting site has printable pocket guides for healthy voting in your state.Support a friend or family member who is new to the electoral process. Give them the attention and resources they need to register to vote and make a voting plan.Consider signing up as a poll worker. You can find more information on the critical need for poll workers on election day by going to helpamericavote.gov. You will notice a lot of activity around Reddit today highlighting National Voter Registration Day, including banner reminders on all platforms and a slate of AMAs that includes: A joint bipartisan AMA with the Secretaries of State of Washington and Minnesota in r/politics An AMA in r/IAmA with Brian Miller; Executive Director of Nonprofit Vote and Managing Partner of of National Voter Registration Day Finally, you might stumble across a certain political fruit as part of our Up The Vote initiative.

A Virtual Conference for a Digital-First Community The moderators of r/AskHistorians came up with the idea of hosting a conference in April, when they realized most scheduled academic events would be canceled or moved online due to the pandemic. They worked together with flaired users to organize the conference and bring to life the inquisitive spirit of the community—after all, r/AskHistorians already includes hundreds of historian experts with a range of qualifications and topic areas. The three-day event will include eight multimedia, recorded panels, followed by live Q&As, which will be held in r/AskHistorians as a series of Ask Me Anythings (AMAs). Speakers include academics, independent researchers, and museum professionals. There will also be live video networking sessions for academics, GLAM community (galleries, libraries, archives and museums), and your average history buffs to connect throughout the conference. Today’s events kick off with Indigenous Histories Disrupting Yours: Sovereignties, History, and Power, where panelists will explore the difference between “histories of Indigeneous peoples” and “Indigeneous history.” Later, keynote speaker Professor Alex Wellerstein, a longtime contributor to r/AskHistorians and a professor at Stevens Institute of Technology, will present The Atomic Bomb and the New Post War Order. All panels will be available to stream on-demand through the AskHistorians YouTube channel. Business as Unusual According to the organizers, the conference’s theme—Business as Unusual—”reflects how human history is filled with examples of people struggling to make do under difficult and quickly changing circumstances.” u/crrpit, a moderator of the community and one of the conference’s organizers, shares: “AskHistorians has always been about widening conversations about history. The kind of academic work that gets discussed at most scholarly conferences is often hidden behind closed doors… It’s just assumed that no one else is really interested. Yet, as the AskHistorians project has shown again and again since 2011, there is actually a huge appetite for historical knowledge out there. This conference is about seeing what happens when you design a scholarly conference with all the doors thrown open — who then gets to be part of the conversation? What new ideas, perspectives and knowledge emerges? We don’t know — but we aim to find out!” Don’t Miss A Thing!

Even the President has weighed in, including with an Executive Order, in which he instructed the Federal Communications Commission to consider new rules on the matter. Unfortunately, the bulk of this debate is focused on how giant, centrally moderated corporations approach content moderation, and fails to appreciate that there are different approaches to moderation, like Reddit’s distributed, user-led method. On Reddit, it’s the users themselves who make the bulk of moderation decisions (99.7% of all non-spam removals, actually, according to our Transparency Report), in their roles as volunteer community moderators. This is a really important point because it’s Section 230 that protects those subreddit moderators from liability. Like your cats standing up? It’s Section 230 that prevents a cats-sitting-down apologist from suing your mod team. We think this is a critically important point that is missing from the current debate. That’s why we’ve filed comments with the FCC on the subject, underscoring that Section 230 protects those everyday users on the internet who choose to participate in community moderation online. And because actual Reddit users are the ones impacted by this, we wanted to use our filing as a way to elevate their unique voices. To that end, the bulk of our filing consists of a submission from the volunteer mods of the r/lgbt subreddit. In it, they describe the rules and procedures they have established for their subreddit to keep it safe and welcoming for their community, and how Section 230 empowers them to do this. There are good reasons to apply scrutiny to how large companies perform content moderation, and to demand transparency in that regard. But the solution to Big Tech is not Big Government. Instead, we think it lies in people—in democratizing online spaces to put more power in the hands of the users themselves. We’ve built that community-first approach into Reddit, and Section 230 is the single law that has most empowered us to be able to do this. Changing that law, or narrowing its scope, would strike an enormous blow to the health of the internet, and to users’ right to create and govern their own spaces online."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community","date":"2020-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"It’s National Poll Worker Recruitment Day! Become a Poll Worker this Election and Help Power the Polls in Your Community","text":"Greetings, redditors! By now, you’ve probably seen our Up the Vote initiative, which aims to inform voters in the US about their rights, how to register, where to find their polling place, and all kinds of other important info about voting. And if you haven’t yet seen it… well, let’s just say that starting today, we’ve made it a little more obvious for you... But there’s more than just voting that goes into making our elections work. Polling places across the country need real, live poll workers to keep things fair and organized. And although this election is likely to see a record number of Americans vote by mail, millions of people—especially voters with certain disabilities and those without reliable mail service—will still rely on in-person voting to cast their ballot. Unfortunately, we are facing an unprecedented shortage of poll workers this year. More than half of the poll workers who served in the 2016 and 2018 elections were over the age of 60, and a quarter were over 70. Yet, due to COVID and the heightened risk it presents for older people, far fewer of these experienced poll workers are signing up, leaving a gap. Inadequate poll worker numbers means those folks who rely on in-person voting will have a harder time, and may face challenges such as long lines and, in some cases, reduced polling hours or the closing of certain polling places all together. But it doesn’t have to be that way! Today, we are participating in National Poll Worker Recruitment Day and encouraging eligible redditors to sign up as poll workers. Go to helpamericavote.gov to learn how. Also, be on the lookout for the “Poll Worker Recruitment Day” banner on the Reddit app and desktop site, which also links to sign up info. And if you’ve got specific questions, you can ask them in an AMA discussion with US Electoral Assistance Commissioner Benjamin Hovland, taking place today at 12:00pm EST in r/politics. We encourage all US redditors to check out these resources, even if you think you might not be eligible or can’t spare an entire day from work. The rules and requirements vary from state to state, so you may end up being pleasantly surprised (and pssst, in most situations you’ll be paid too. Who said good deeds go unrewarded?).

Snoosweek is an internal make-a-thon where we encourage Snoos (that’s Reddit employees) to explore projects outside of their usual work, collaborate with others on something aimed at making Reddit better, and learn new skills in the process. We took a brief hiatus from Snoosweek in the beginning of 2020 as we figured out how to best scale the program alongside the growing number of employees, but are pleased to share that it’s back online (and better than ever). Here’s the TL;DR on how Snoosweek works: Snoosweek takes place twice a year, in Q1 and Q3, with a separate week in Q4 dedicated to improving quality within respective teams.Prior to Snoosweek, individuals pitch their idea for a project and other folks in the company can volunteer to join their team.The week culminates with all teams presenting their projects to the broader company.A panel of judges will determine the winners based on a set of categories.We have a set of goals that each project should be aligned with:Focus on Reddit: Reddit has an audacious mission of bringing community and belonging to everyone in the world. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done in service of this mission and so we ask that Snoosweek projects focus on Reddit.Improve yourself: Snoosweek is a time to grow as an individual. This could mean taking on a new role for a project or working on a problem in a different area from your day-to-dayCollaborate with your fellow Snoos: Over time it is easy for our teams to become insular. Snoosweek is an opportunity for you to collaborate with Snoos you do not normally work with. One of the main drivers of Snoosweek is an opportunity and willingness to fail. In work (and life), we often shy away from trying new, experimental or difficult things due to a fear of failure. Snoosweek is a time where it is explicitly okay to try something and fail. Your project does not have to ship for it to be considered a success. Your experience and sharing what you learned with your fellow Snoos is just as valuable. Last week wrapped up our first Snoosweek of 2020, and it was a whirlwind event! Folks across the company worked on the following projects last week, including: Comment sharingAMP securityAndroid build timesLocalizing mweb in GermanyRecommending ads to usersReddit Request 2.0Reddar bulk reviewRecently clicked postsRPAN studioVideo watermarkingReddit Gifts gift timelineChat gifs& much more!

From fashion and politics to sports and gaming, the common thread connecting all Reddit communities is the upvote and downvote system. It puts power in the hands of our users, giving them a voice in determining which content is most visible (and which content falls to the bottom of the feed). Content on Reddit receives an average of 165 million votes per day. But did you know that the 2016 presidential election only saw 140.1 million votes, representing just 63% of eligible voters (source)? Numbers like these are why we are launching our Up the Vote initiative, an effort to get redditors to vote where it matters most: at the ballot box. With this campaign, we are focused on alerting, educating, and activating redditors on their right to vote; and have a number of special holidays, initiatives, and surprises lined up in order to do so, including: An AMA series on voting laws, rights and processes, to answer all your questions about voting, from the security of voting by mail to how you can volunteer to Power the Polls as a poll worker.On September 22, Reddit celebrates National Voter Registration Day. Look for special AMAs and activations across the site connecting you with all the information you need to register to vote, including how to update your registration in the case of a life event like a move or a name change (pssst– get a head start by going to vote.gov to check registration information for your state).On October 24th, we are activating around Vote Early Day, where we’ll help connect Redditors with resources about their options to vote early, either by mail, or early in-place voting (check the options in you state here) On November 3rd, it’s Election Day! We’ll remind you (maybe to the point of annoyance) to get out and vote, and connect you with resources about how to find your polling place, what ID requirements you might need to bring (and what to do if you don’t have it), and other important information. (But hey, no need to leave it to the last minute– start researching here today and make a plan to vote now.) You thought it was over, didn’t you? Not even close!

For redditors, Image Galleries provides an uncomplicated way to take part in Reddit’s 100,000+ communities and simplifies the process of including multiple images or gifs in a single post. It also equips redditors, media organizations, and partners with a different method to engage more than 430 million active users on the platform. An Image Gallery post in feed on r/recipes. “Image Galleries fulfill a longstanding community request ever since we added support for image uploads back in 2016,” said Reddit Senior Product Manager, Tyler Swartz. “We’re excited about products like Image Galleries because they give redditors more ways to engage and share content with their favorite community, while also making communities more vibrant and exciting.” Image Galleries is a popular feature request from style, DIY, and food communities on Reddit. For example, style communities want a better way to show off multiple fits for clothing, ideas for interior design, and different make-up techniques in a single post with captions and links to the products. DIY and food communities desire step-by-step instructions in a single post with multiple pictures, clarifying captions, and links to recipes and tutorials. The mobile user interface for posting an Image Gallery in the r/recipes subreddit. Creating an Image Gallery To post an Image Gallery, redditors simply visit their favorite community, tap the ‘Create a Post’ button, and then select the ‘Image Post’ option from the tabs. From there, it’s a matter of selecting up to 20 images or gifs. Once selected, redditors can rearrange them, include a post title, add an optional caption (up to 180 characters) or URL for each image or gif, and then tap ‘post.’ Posters can also apply a ‘Spoiler’ or ‘Not Safe For Work’ tag to Image Galleries if needed. Image Galleries must be turned on by community moderators for redditors to use the feature. The desktop user interface for posting an Image Gallery. Media Organizations and Partner Engagement For media organizations and partners alike, Image Galleries offers the option to include URLs and captions in Image Galleries, creating an opportunity to drive redditors to news articles, products, events, contests, and more. Serious Eats, Insider, The Independent, and National Geographic are among the first partners to utilize this feature. They plan to use Image Galleries to interact with their fans and gain even more enthusiasts in the process. What’s to Come As of today, Reddit Image Galleries are enabled for all communities that opt-in. Android support will be released next week. We plan to add Image Gallery support for mixed media types (videos, images, and gifs all in one post) down the road. So look for your favorite subreddit, post some gifs and pictures, and let us know what you think! For more information, including how to post an Image Gallery, add URLs, and caption multiple photos, check out our post on r/announcements."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddits-first-ever-virtual-recruiting-event","date":"2020-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Life at Reddit"],"title":"Reddit’s First-Ever Virtual Recruiting Event","text":"As Reddit continues to adapt to being a remote-centric workforce, we’re thinking about how we can sustain the recruitment of top talent in a virtual environment. As such, we’re looking towards new and innovative ways to provide networking opportunities to those who are curious about joining Reddit. Black People Reddit (AKA “BPR”) is Reddit’s internal resource group for Black employees and their goal is to help recruit, develop and retain Black talent. Together with our Recruiting team, BPR recently hosted Reddit’s first-ever virtual career fair. The objective was to introduce Black talent to Reddit and connect those interested in becoming a Snoo (that’s what we call Reddit employees) with teams that are hiring now or will be in the future. To kick off the event, CEO Steve Huffman took part in an AMA-style discussion. From there, attendees were presented with the choice of 9 breakout sessions, where they had the opportunity to hear more about specific Reddit teams directly from hiring managers and Snoos. We’re pleased to report that the pilot event was both well-attended and well-received — we had 60 Snoos and over 200 attendees join! We also received a few rave reviews from those who were present: “I never knew the story of Reddit. I was not sure how useful the platform could be, but the event helped me see how far Reddit [has] gone. Also, before the event, I was sure it would just be like any other company, but there was this kind of warmness I felt throughout the event; every question was answered, everyone was just plain open; it was different from what I’ve seen in such events.”“The CEO’s commitment to having diverse employees that reflects the Reddit online community in which the company serves.”“Seeing the culture first hand was a game changer. I loved the energy and transparency.”“Thanks for facilitating the BPR event earlier today, as an avid user of Reddit for 6+ years now it was nice to see how the company is run under the hood and hear from Steve. While I am not currently looking for my next opportunity I would love to stay connected for the future” Fostering a culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging is a top priority at Reddit. Our People & Culture org, which includes Recruiting, Experience, and Human Resources, is focused on progressing our company commitments to combat bias in recruiting and hiring practices, promote inclusion in our approach to leadership and employee experience, and ultimately bring us closer to the Reddit we envision ourselves being — one that reflects the world’s diversity across race, ethnicity, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ability, and more.

After launching their campaigns, our advertisers use the platform’s reporting dashboard to see how their ads are performing based on almost 90 different metrics. This is one of the most utilized features of our platform because advertisers use it to monitor the effectiveness of their campaigns. Picture of a dashboard and commonly used metrics. One of the top requests we heard from customers at the end of 2019 is that they wanted to receive these reports at a regular cadence. Many of our customers have daily morning meetings where they review ad metric reports and decide on how much to spend on their campaigns with Reddit. In order to address this customer need, we built a scalable and asynchronous automated reporting system that generates these reports and sends them to the advertisers at regular intervals. Here’s how we were able to find a solution that meets their needs. The Design First, we went to the whiteboard and started laying out the design. The infrastructure of this product contains three major components: A Reporting Service that provides the functionality to save, schedule and retrieve the saved reports.A Scheduler for scheduling the report emails.A Report Exporter to email the user their reports. The architecture of the reporting automation system. We describe the details of each component in the following sections. Reporting Service We built a new thrift-based service to provide an API for creating, loading and scheduling the reporting views. A reporting view is a set of selected metrics on the dashboard that a user wants to save and schedule for an email. In order to ensure that this functionality can scale independently we decided to build a new service. Although we spent some extra time and effort to deploy an additional service, it helped us iterate quickly without the fear of breaking existing services. Our advertising platform communicates with our backend via Ads API: an HTTP gateway that talks to various services over thrift. Ads API holds the HTTP endpoints for saving and scheduling reporting views. The reporting service uses Amazon Aurora – a Postgres-compatible cloud database. We chose Aurora over something like NoSQL because: The system isn’t read-heavy.We need strong transaction guarantees. For example, when a reporting view is disabled, we need to ensure that all scheduled jobs are also disabled. This service is built using Baseplate, which is Reddit’s framework for building Python services. Baseplate gives us features like metrics, monitoring and error capturing for free. At Reddit, we primarily use Python and Go but in this case we preferred Python because: We didn’t have very high throughput requirements for this system. Baseplate had better support for Python. Scheduler When a user schedules a report, our application logic creates a Task in the database with the timestamp indicating when that report is supposed to be sent. For example, if today is Monday and I schedule a report with weekly cadence, a Task will be created with the timestamp of next Monday. A Task is defined as a single row in a Postgres table. Payload of a single Task. We set up a cron Kubernetes instance that runs at a fixed time everyday and selects the set of saved Tasks from the database that are scheduled to be sent for the given day. For each Task, it fetches the configuration of that report and publishes a message to an Amazon SQS queue. Kafka and RabbitMQ were also among the candidates but SQS was chosen because: We needed an unordered queue because we don’t want one failed report to block the rest of the Tasks.SQS provides dead letter queue functionality that helps us easily retry the failed reports. A single message in SQS looks like this: The state of a task is saved in Postgres DB. A Task is marked as PROCESSING after it lands on the queue. The task scheduler is a singleton job that ensures that exactly one message is published to SQS. We do this in order to ensure that a user doesn’t receive multiple messages. We generate an alert if this cron instance crashes. In the future we are planning to increase the cron job’s frequency to provide more granular timing selection for our advertisers. We intentionally kept it out in the first version because we wanted to verify the resource requirements to process a single day’s reports. Exporter The exporter is a SQS consumer that picks up a message from SQS and performs the following operations: Fetch the reporting data saved in Druid.Save this data to S3 in a CSV format.Use Reddit’s email service to send the emails to the selected recipients. If there is an issue at any of the steps above, we retry three times before moving the message to the dead-letter-queue. But are these steps idempotent? Yes, a single SQS message contains a unique identifier that’s used as part of S3 key and as a parameter in the email message. So if a report is saved on S3 but the email fails, we start again from step 1 and in step 2, we just overwrite the existing report. To ensure data security and privacy, the user uses an authenticated link in the email to download the CSV, that means even if the email link is leaked, the report data will be safe. When the user clicks the ‘Download CSV’ link, they have to login to the dashboard to trigger the CSV download. In order to ensure the product is working as intended, we set up alerts on the following dimensions: There are zero reports sent in the last 24 hours. The cron job that schedules the reports fails.The SQS consumer fails to process a message and that message lands in the dead-letter-queue. The Future Reporting automation has helped make our advertisers’ lives much easier because they can now load a report with a single click. It also gave our team the opportunity to explore a lot of infrastructural products available at Reddit, e.g. SQS and email services, which is the first step towards further improving the reporting experience. We will monitor how our users utilize this feature and iterate more on it in the future.

It sounds far fetched, but for me, it worked. The principle is called The Matthew Effect, which states “Those who already have status are often placed in situations where they gain more, and those that do not have status typically struggle to achieve more.” I stumbled across this principle two years ago, completely by accident, after picking up a side project to reduce the massive clutter we were seeing in our error logging. My project reduced our error logging by ~96% (removing a total of 149 million log lines per day) and suddenly, people were paying attention to my work. As the principle states, once you are recognized, all of your future work is more likely to get recognized. I started getting invited to new, important meetings. My opinion suddenly seemed to matter more. I was placed in the ‘Top Performers’ tier and won an internal award from our CTO. I became tech lead for a new team and was ultimately promoted to a manager position, all within a year of completing this project. And maybe the most important metric of them all, my salary since my project launched has increased by 40%. I am confident that without (accidentally) creating my own Matthew Effect, it would have taken much longer for my career to reach this point. All of these changes were motivating and made me wonder: How can I “manifest” this Matthew Effect for others? From this question, the GAINS Program was born. GAINS stands for Grow and Improve New Skills and is designed to enable and empower junior and mid-level ICs to: Hone their ability to identify high impact workGrow confidence in tackling projects beyond one’s perceived experience levelProvide talking points for future career conversationsGain experience in promoting the work they are doing Each step in the program is aimed at manifesting the Matthew Effect for each of the participants. Now, onto the specifics. GAINS pairs a high level IC with a mentee. The mentor’s role is to pick a high impact project for their mentee to tackle over the course of a quarter. The project should be geared towards stretching their mentee’s current skill set, and should also be high impact in nature (think: architectural projects, framework improvements, items that would improve the engineering org as a whole). Mentees and mentors meet at least 1x/week, with the mentor providing light tactical guidance for when their mentee is stuck — these sessions should be focused on working through a bug, rather than generalized career conversations. At the end of the program, mentees should be able to walk away with a completed project under their belt and be ready to present their improvements at company-wide All Hands. Generally, the time commitment is ~10% of the mentees time over the course of one quarter. From this program, we’ve seen 9 amazing projects come to fruition. This list includes: A library that allows any Reddit web client to painlessly integrate with GQL A ML pipeline to allow Reddit to connect models to real-time servicesAn autoscaling framework that can be tailored to each specific service at RedditA Kafka streaming service to allow our ads to utilize real-time dataA CRUD-model maker, a script that saves >300 lines of code per new CRUD service A Reddit-specific linter, implemented across 50+ of our python servicesStructured GQL logs to improve the debugging experience across all services that use GQLA bot that detects and alerts on duplicated code across our codebasesA new UI that allows any engineer to understand the state of their Kubernetes cluster across our vast distributed systems architecture As a reminder, these are junior and mid-level engineers completing these projects, which is nuts! Work like this would typically be given to a senior developer — someone who has already manifested that Matthew Effect for themselves — which can delay junior developers from accomplishing impactful work and potentially hold back their career progression. Through this program, we’ve been able to strategically grow our internal engineering talent to compliment our external hiring efforts. And in an industry where only 13% of engineers are women (Reddit is above the industry average at 24%, which is great but shows how much work we still have to do to further close the gap), we feel that it’s pertinent to foster the career growth of women within Reddit’s engineering org. As such, we’re thrilled that women have made up 88% of the program’s mentees thus far. Additionally, the program enables our senior engineers to receive explicit, guided practice for how to be an effective mentor, which are powerful learnings they can share with their own teams to implement. This also helps foster a culture of collaboration and accomplishment-sharing across Reddit engineering, rather than solely valuing a short list of “10xers”. If this engineering culture sounds like something you’d like to be a part of, we are hiring engineers! And if the GAINS program in particular sounds like something you’d want to lead, we’re also hiring a Learning & Development specialist to scale it, among other internal education initiatives."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/voices-of-change","date":"2020-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Voices Of Change","text":"As protests ripple across the nation, we at Reddit stand together with all those who demand racial justice.

Over the weekend, we’ve seen cities across the country erupt in pain and action in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and a painfully long list of other Black people at the hands of the police, other civilians, and a systemic violence that stretches back, unbroken, throughout our country’s history. We’ve seen many of those protesting this systemic violence met with even more violence showing how little has changed in our country—and how critical it is for all of us to affirm with our voices and actions that Black lives matter. I’ve seen it outside my home as daytime protests turn into violence at night, leaving me and my family scared in our own homes, scared for our local communities, scared for those outside demonstrating in the street, and scared for our employees and members of our community for whom that feeling of fear is a daily reality. We work for this platform because we care deeply about community and belonging. But community and belonging are not possible without safety from violence, and now is the time to stand in solidarity with the Black members of our communities (locally, at Reddit Inc., on Reddit, and beyond). As Snoos, we do not tolerate hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear. I know many of you are wondering what you can do and what we as a company can do. One important thing we can all do today is to support one another. Listen, empathize, and be there for each other, even if it means having uncomfortable conversations you may not have had before. Across our company people are having a wide range of experiences and emotions, not all of which will be obvious and some of which will be very raw for your fellow Snoos. If you need help, ask for it, if you need space, take it, and if you have support to offer, do so. It’s tempting to look for short-term fixes, but what we are seeing isn’t just a last week problem, or a 2020 problem, or even a last four year problem. We are facing a crisis that has been hundreds of years in the making, is sadly repetitive, and is not going to be fixed overnight. However, Reddit has a duty to give people a voice and be an impetus for change. We will be considered in our response and are indeed considering a wide range of options, both for the short term and into the future. In the short term, we are exploring a range of options, from on-site activations, to shifting marketing resources to address these needs, and hosting AMA’s that will help guide conversations. And of course, I’d like us to find a way to let Reddit do what Reddit does best and—among other things—amplify conversations that people need to see (here’s one from r/blacklivesmatter from the weekend worth calling out), surfacing the experiences people come to our platform to share (protests on RPAN as one example from this weekend), and supporting our communities on the site (with outreach from Community and Safety to communities of Black redditors specifically). More long term, there are causes that we can support—if not lead—that are both aligned with our values and can make a real difference, most top of mind being voting reform, which would help give a voice to those who are effectively disenfranchised. We have a responsibility, through these and other efforts that will take shape in the days to come, to participate in effecting change thoughtfully and meaningfully. Reddit has taken strong positions on this issue in the last few election cycles, but there is more we can do here particularly in context of COVID and the potential threats to the integrity of the vote. I am heartened to see so many of our Snoos looking for ways to stand up, both outside of work and with your fellow Snoos (whether making donations to national and local orgs fighting racism and police violence or asking how to be better allies to coworkers of color and more). The People & Culture team and I spoke earlier with People Leaders to start what will be ongoing conversations at Reddit around allyship and how we as a company show up, speak out, and take action. We will share more at this Thursday’s All-Hands (if not before) on how we are going to do so.

To ensure that we’re able to help the 130,000+ communities on Reddit continue to thrive, our employees’ wellbeing is the highest priority we have. “The entire executive team, led by Steve, is engaged in an ongoing discussion about the future of work at Reddit. We will do whatever we need to ensure our team feels safe, comfortable and supported while working at Reddit.” – Nellie Peshkov, VP of People & Culture, Reddit As people around the world learn to live with a “new normal,” it’s essential that we shift our strategies in how we support employees moving forward, whether that’s through offering team resources, innovative applications, or new remote initiatives. In response to the current crisis, here are some of the ways Reddit has pivoted to support its global workforce — we will continue to update this list as the situation evolves: Restructuring Employee Benefits We offer yearly Wanderlust and Evolve stipends for each employee to indulge in interests or hobbies that make them feel human and encourage a positive work-life balance. In light of COVID-19, we’ve opened up these stipends to include almost anything an employee needs to take care of themselves, their loved ones, or their communities during this unprecedented time. We have also reallocated each employee’s monthly Commuter benefit allowance amount to their Evolve stipend to continue to provide extra support. Mental Health Support All employees have 24/7 access to resources and unlimited phone consultations for stress, grief counseling, depression and relationship conflicts. This benefit includes three face-to-face visits (costs are covered) with a licensed professional. Monday Meditations Led by Reddit’s Head of Brand Strategy, Will Cady, every Monday a cohort of Snoos carve out time for a guided meditation. Will opens each session by checking in on how people are feeling and ends each session by sharing practices for how you can integrate a more conscious mindset into the rest of your day. We also offer employees a free subscription to Headspace, a meditation, mindfulness, and sleep app. WFH Challenges To keep things interesting and help folks across the company stay connected, our People & Culture team coordinates weekly WFH challenges with a Reddit flair. From an r/BlunderYears-style quiz of employees’ most hilarious childhood photos to house tour videos à la MTV Cribs, we’ve loved seeing each other make the best of working remotely. Nice Snoo Meet You To help employees continue to make new connections within the company, we built a tool that lets Snoos from around the globe pair up, meet over VC, and get to know each other. The tool matches you with other Snoos who have opted into groups you’ve joined on our company Slack, for example #WomenOfReddit. Fitness at Home Thanks to a partnership with boutique fitness brand Rumble Boxing, throughout May, Snoos can break a sweat with virtual workout classes focused on cardio and strength training. Company-Wide Day Off In May, Reddit also gave all employees an extra day off to spend however they please. Some of us spent the day hiking while others opted for staring out the window for 4 hours uninterrupted — R&R looks different for everyone! Take Your Snoolings to Work Day In April, we offered a day of sessions to help keep employees’ children entertained. These virtual hangouts included DIY PlayDough making, story time with Elsa from Frozen, and some very important Silly Dancing Time. Additional Training and Resources Since COVID-19, we have rolled out Work From Home Trainings across the company, some designed for our employees and others designed for our People Leaders. In addition, we have created a series of “People Leader Newsletters” to send a steady stream of information, tips, and best practices for our managers to help them more effectively lead their teams during this time. Flexible Work Hours We’re empowering our Snoos to manage their work in the way that is most effective for them. Whether it’s starting later in the day, ending the day earlier, or not having meetings on a set day each week, employees are encouraged to create work boundaries that help them stay healthy, sane and productive. Planning for Office Re-Entry We’re currently evaluating what Reddit’s re-entry plan will be across all of our offices and reflecting on ways we can become a more effective company for remote work moving forward. Our goal is to be supportive and flexible of our employees’ needs and comfort levels whether they’re working in the office or remotely. As such, we will not be requiring any employees to work from an office through the end of this year and expect most employees to continue to work remotely. And we will find ways to support employees who need to work in the office while keeping their safety top of mind."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-announces-new-leadership-and-organizational-structure-for-reddit-advertising-business","date":"2020-04-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Reddit Announces New Leadership and Organizational Structure for Reddit Advertising Business","text":"Reddit, Inc. is pleased to announce new executive leadership and share a restructure of its advertising business that will better serve the needs of current and prospective partners. In early May, Harold Klaje will join Reddit’s Executive Team as VP of Advertising, and will be responsible for setting the strategy and operational direction of Reddit’s global advertising sales business. Introducing Harold Klaje In his role, Harold will be responsible for growing Reddit’s global advertising partner base, building out the sales team and internal operations, and working closely with cross-functional partners to ensure the right products, campaign support, and marketing programs across the business. Reporting to Reddit Chief Operating Officer, Jen Wong, Harold takes the reins from former VP of Brand Partnerships, Zubair Jandali, whose 5+-year tenure helped build the foundation of Reddit’s thriving advertising and sales business. Harold joins Reddit from Pinterest, where he served as Global Head of Growth, working across international sales, marketing, product engineering, operations, finance and strategy to accelerate growth and revenue. Prior to Pinterest, he spent almost a decade in leadership roles at Google and is experienced in building and scaling global operations. “As an avid user, I’ve long been impressed by the depth and breadth of Reddit’s communities and believe there is so much potential for brand engagement that is still largely untapped,” said Klaje. “With the platform continuing to grow and diversify, the opportunities for advertisers are immense and I’m looking forward to bringing these to the fore for existing and prospective partners.” “Harold is a passionate and highly operational leader with a proven track record of driving scale for some of the biggest brands in the world,” said Reddit COO, Jen Wong. “As we continue to grow our user base and advertising partners, and eye international expansion in the UK and beyond, he is perfectly placed to lead our sales organization into an exciting next phase of growth.” A restructured advertising business for Reddit Harold will lead Reddit’s recently reorganized sales structure, which recently formed three distinct teams to better serve the needs of the market and capitalize on the unique proposition Reddit brings to advertisers. A new Brand Partnerships team, which is led by Mary Ann Belliveau, is focused on serving the needs of established, Fortune 500 brands through high-touch consultation, unique insights and creative strategy for measurable, scalable solutions. It is joined by a dedicated Growth Partnerships team which is focused on building relationships with emerging, DTC and mobile-first brands and is led by Neal Hubman. The team will work with advertisers who transact directly and are often looking for performance media with customized posts and creative that feel native to the Reddit user experience. A third Activation and Enablement team has also been established to act as the connective tissue between the Sales organization and the rest of the business. Headed by Brandon Pierce, Activation and Enablement supports Reddit’s largest strategic partnerships, creative success, campaign and ad product go-to-market strategy. Including both Brand Strategy and Sales Enablement, the new team aims to support larger-scale bespoke campaigns and disseminate thought leadership around Reddit’s value proposition in the market. These new teams, along with Agency Development led by Leanne Doan, and all teams under Sales Strategy and Operations (Ads Ops, Business Operations/Analytics, Sales Operations) will report to Harold. “We are already seeing the benefits of this sales reorganization, which is enabling our teams to provide deeper, tailored expertise and solutions for distinct sets of advertising partners,” Wong continued. “Now, with new leadership in Harold Klaje, Reddit’s advertising business is poised to meet the market during this challenging time and accelerate our growth.” Harold Klaje joins Reddit this week and will be based out of the San Francisco office.

From discussing gaming-related news and sharing content around new releases, to mining through the latest memes and fan theories, gaming communities continue to be highly engaged on Reddit, with the category seeing a 42% YoY increase in subscribers in the top 50 gaming communities in 2019. To give gaming industry leaders more insight into discussions happening in these communities, today Reddit is thrilled to announce our first-ever gaming data partnership with Newzoo, the world’s leading provider of games and esports analytics. “Gaming communities on Reddit are incredibly engaged, and we believe that partnering with Newzoo will empower those in the games market to access critical community insights,” said Alex Riccomini, Senior Director of Business Development at Reddit. “This is Reddit’s first dedicated data partnership in the gaming space, and we look forward to delivering a deeper view of Reddit’s communities to game developers, publishers, and brands together with Newzoo.” What This Partnership Means Pro users of Newzoo’s Analytics Platform will have the ability to browse engagement from our gaming-related communities and benchmark the level of community activity around any game IP, using a variety of metrics like total subscribers, posts per day, and comments per day. The plan is to expand these insights over time, providing a deeper look into the thoughtful and passionate conversations taking place on Reddit about games, intermediate releases, esports, teams, and leagues. “Tracking game IP popularity across traditional social platforms is common practice in the games business. Working together with Reddit, however, we’re going beyond that, developing new insights that aren’t available anywhere else,” said Peter Warman, Newzoo’s Co-Founder and CEO. “It’s by far the most preferred platform of the largest and most vocal gaming communities and our partnership is key in our objective to provide a 360° view on game engagement.

Here’s What You Need To Know.","text":"As we see time and again on Reddit, redditors are community-minded and rise to any occasion to support one another. Whether it’s offering support to each other during the coronavirus pandemic, or sharing information on how to request an absentee ballot, redditors continue to help each other on the issues that matter. The 2020 Census is no different, and we’re here today to share information on how the count will go on — safely — despite the COVID situation. April 1st might be April Fools, but it is also Census day in the United States. As we’ve mentioned on Reddit before, the Census is a constitutionally mandated function of our government that requires the count of everyone living in the United States of America, and Reddit is committed to helping support public participation. In light of the safety and public health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to know that you can do your civic duty and respond to the Census from the comfort of your own, socially distant, home. By now all households have likely received an invitation by mail to participate in the Census, with a unique household code. But even if you misplace the letter/ID number for your household, you can still go on-line at https://my2020census.gov/ to complete the form without that code. And if you’re a college student with questions about how you should respond, this explainer video from the Bureau offers some answers. And for those who, like us, believe that DataIsBeautiful, you can dig in here to see response rates in your area and across the country. Finally, to educate the community on how to best respond to the 2020 Census we are excited that Ron Jarmin, the Deputy Director and Chief Operating Officer of the U.S. Census Bureau, will be back to join us for another AMA® in honor of Census Day (if you missed his first one, check it out here).

For Poll creators, the new post type is a straightforward way to engage with Reddit’s 100,000+ active communities, and understand exactly what people think about a given topic. For those voting, Polls makes it easier than ever for our 430 million monthly active users to participate in the conversation, even if they’d prefer not to comment. The result of an r/Superman Poll asking users to vote on if they prefer Superman with trunks or no trunks. “Reddit’s content and community ecosystem is vast, so we know it’s important to provide different ways for people to interact with one another,” said Reddit Senior Product Manager, Tyler Swartz. “Our hope in launching Polls is to provide an easy entry point for new users by removing the barrier of posting and giving people the option to weigh-in and contribute to their favorite communities via a simple vote. In addition, users have the ability to comment on a Poll and we are excited to see the spirited conversation take place.” Creating a Poll Polls are an easy way for people on Reddit to post, comment and interact with other users across more than 100,000 online communities. With just a few clicks, users can weigh-in on all the topics they care about, in the communities that matter most to them. To post a Poll, Reddit users can simply visit their favorite community, tap the “Create a Post” button and select the Poll option from the tabs. Polls can be open for up to one week, and the end-time must be selected at the time of posting. Then, it’s simply a matter of posing a question, listing up to six answer options for the community to choose from, and allowing the conversation to unfold. The user interface for posting a Poll in the r/CasualConversation subreddit. The Super Bowl Test In recent months, our Polls pilot tests have shown it to be a fun and highly engaging way for communities to weigh-in on a wide variety of conversations, from the most topical and timely to age-old Reddit queries, like “Is a hot dog a sandwich?” Back in February, when “Who will win?” was the burning question on everyone’s lips as the San Francisco 49ers prepared to take on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV, we worked with the National Football League to get the r/NFL community’s thoughts. u/NFL posts a Poll in r/NFL asking “Which team will win Super Bowl LIV?” The result was a democratic process that unfolded with impassioned debate. After 48 hours, Reddit’s r/NFL community was in a near 50/50 split with the San Francisco 49ers barely edging out the Kansas City Chiefs – 4,600 votes to 4,500 votes. In the end, u/NFL’s Poll saw a total of 9,100 votes cast, with the post receiving five times more comments than a typical u/NFL post – demonstrating Polls as an amazing community engagement tool. We also tested Polls in other popular Reddit communities with moderators posting varied prompts that led to lively conversation and discussion. Polls were tested in communities as diverse as r/PS4, r/Knitting, r/Premierleague and r/Casualconversation who used Polls to sense-check Reddit user behaviour, asking “What kind of user are you?”. r/Superman asked its community to weigh-in on their preference of a very important topic: “Trunks” or “No Trunks.” What’s to Come As of today, Reddit Polls are enabled for all communities, except for text-only groups such as r/AskReddit. So look for your favorite subreddit, create a Poll, cast a vote and let us know what you think!

And as we invest in highlighting those trends for user visibility and participation, it presents a huge opportunity for advertisers looking to align with conversations in real-time. Today, Reddit is excited to announce the launch of its first trending ad product: Trending Takeover. With this new offering, brands looking to position themselves at the center of discussion on Reddit now have premium venues in two of the most commonly visited areas of the platform: Reddit’s Search tab and Popular feed. A mobile view of Trending Takeover on Reddit’s Popular feed, where people discover the most popular trends. Why Trending Takeover Reddit is home to more than 430 million monthly active users engaging deeply within 100,000+ interest-based communities — one-third of whom visit Reddit’s Popular feed every day. As a platform where the majority of users believe that Reddit influences cultural trends and millions of searches are conducted daily, the new Trending Takeover product gives advertisers access to millions of Reddit users who are in an active, information-gathering mindset. With a maximum campaign life of 24 hours, Trending Takeover aligns brands with the most popular and relevant trends and conversations of the day. Brands are prominently placed in the Search tab for Trending Takeover. The Trending Takeover Experience Users can see the Trending Takeover ad unit in the second slot of the Trending Today module on Reddit’s Popular feed, as well as the second slot of the Trending Today drop-down in Reddit’s Search tab. Similar to organic trends on Reddit, clicking on a Trending Takeover ad in the ‘Trending Today’ module within Search or Popular will drive users to a landing page featuring conversations, posts, and communities relating to handpicked advertiser keywords. With Trending Takeover, advertisers have the ability to promote their campaign next to the largest trends on Reddit. Advertisers will also be able to spotlight their trend on the Trending Takeover landing page, driving further engagement and visibility. The desktop and mobile layout of the Trending Takeover landing page. Trending Takeover with Beta Test Partners In recent months, Reddit beta-tested Trending Takeover with more than 15 partners across entertainment, consumer tech, CPG, automotive, and QSR verticals, including Spotify, Method, and Adobe. In aggregate, Beta partners saw an increase in surfaced conversations and a click-through rate two-times greater than the industry standard for social platforms. In their campaign, “There’s a Good Inside,” Method leveraged Trending Takeover to amplify brand awareness and drive video views for their new dish soap. As one of the first brands to test Trending Takeover, Method brought value to Reddit’s plant enthusiasts in the form of a how-to video by popular plant and interior stylist, Hilton Carter, who explained the steps to bring shine back to house plants using Method’s dish soap. With hand-selected keywords and custom creative on the Trending Takeover landing page, Method’s activation achieved a click-through rate two-times higher than the industry standard for social platforms by targeting relevant Reddit communities including r/houseplants, r/gardening, and r/malelivingspace. Trending Takeover also expanded Method’s campaign reach, driving video views with a video completion rate four-times that of their Reddit Promoted Posts. “Reddit’s Trending Takeover put a megaphone on our brand message and aligned us perfectly with our target audience through creative that included plant expert, Hilton Carter,” said Connie Chen, Vice President of Brands at Method. “As the home to so many plant communities and enthusiasts, Reddit was the ideal place to get in front of consumers in a delightful way and reach audiences at scale.” What It Means for Advertisers As the Reddit Ads platform continues to evolve to meet advertiser needs, we’re pleased to offer new ways for brands to connect with millions of users and establish cultural relevance among top trends. Through Trending Takeover, brands can build awareness on the topics and issues that their brands align with and hold 100% sponsored share of voice on Reddit’s Popular feed and Search tab. “With millions of searches taking place every day and over one-third of users coming to Reddit’s Popular feed daily, brands can now be part of where cultural trends are born online — Reddit,” said Shariq Rizvi, Vice President of Ads Product and Engineering at Reddit. “For Reddit, a large focus for 2020 is about maximizing new and premium opportunities for brands to authentically engage with Reddit users.” Trending Takeover can be sold only on a reservation basis.

Among other reasons, they come here to create a community for themselves online that they may not have in their physical world and dive deeper into the topics they love most — and there are communities for just about any culture, identity, interest, hobby, or stage of life a woman identifies with. International Women’s Day is upon us (March 8th, mark your calendars!) and to celebrate, we’re sharing just a few or our favorite women-focused communities — from the long-standing OGs (looking at you r/twoxchromosomes) to the rising (psst.. r/actuallesbians). This list of communities is not exhaustive and we encourage you to consider what’s missing from it so that you can go out there and create your own. r/twoxchromosomes Celebrating its 11th anniversary this year, r/twoxchromosomes is one of the oldest and the 47th largest community on Reddit with 12.6M active subscribers. Labeled as a subreddit for “both serious and silly content, intended for women’s perspectives,” r/twoxchromosomes welcomes all genders so long as they are respectful of the community’s guidelines and fellow members. It’s a place for women seeking a community with whom they can share their voice or for anyone that is looking to expose themselves to more viewpoints on a variety of topics — and in today’s climate, those are both very good things. For many women, this subreddit often serves as a gateway to joining other more niche collectives on Reddit. r/trollxchromosomes If r/twoxchromosomes had a sarcastic twin, it would be r/trollxchromosomes. This is a home for women and allies of women to share political and social issue memes that pertain to — you guessed it — women. These memes often act as springboards for thoughtful discussion about the topic at hand. If you prefer your civil discourse served with humor, this community is worth checking out. r/thegirlsurvivalguide A subreddit created in 2012 for girls to share and discuss tips, r/thegirlsurvivalguide is like a crowd-sourced user manual for life that is constantly being added to. From the most awkward of period questions to suggestions for nailing a job interview, no stone goes unturned. Seriously, where was this community when I was navigating high school and college? r/actuallesbians A place for discussion among cisgender and transgender lesbians, bisexual women, allies, and everyone in between, r/actuallesbians is one of the more inclusive corners of the internet. In just a year and a half, r/actuallesbians has already amassed 226k members and is one of the largest LGBTQ communities on Reddit. r/xxfitness Don’t let its name deter you, this community is completely SFW. r/xxfitness is toning up for its 10 year anniversary this summer. Boasting over 374k members, this is the go-to subreddit for health and fitness-minded women and non-binary folks who are looking to share motivation, challenges, and regimens with their peers. r/girlgamers Ready Player 1? Whether you’re a diehard Halo fan or more of a Sims kind of girl, r/girlgamers is a space for ladies to talk about gaming and find fellow gamers to play with. The rules aren’t hard-and-fast though, they also discuss topics related to being a woman within the broader “geek” culture. r/mommit If you’re tired of being inundated with unrealistic expectations of motherhood on Instagram, Pinterest, and the like, you’re not alone. In fact, nearly 100k women have already formed a community to share their extremely real experiences of being a mom in r/mommit. Their motto: “We are people. Mucking through the ickier parts of child raising. It may not always be fun, awesome, and pretty, but we do it.” Finally, parenting content that isn’t picture perfect. Praise be. r/ladiesofscience r/ladiesofscience is just one of the many STEM-related corners of Reddit. Whether you’re a scientist, a wannabe scientist, or just a woman who loves science (which should be everyone because it’s awesome), your questions and thoughts are welcome here.

Through this partnership, redditors will receive a private message directing them how to connect and text with a trained Crisis Counselor at the moment they need them. Support where and when you need it Crisis Text Line is unique in that it provides resources and support through a medium people already use and trust: text. As an anonymous, text-based platform (like Reddit), Crisis Text Line provides a harmonious transition for at-risk redditors who are seeking help and may not be comfortable or safe talking on the phone. If a redditor is flagged as struggling with serious self-harm or suicide, they will receive an immediate private message with various resources and a recommendation to text the key phrase CHAT to 741741 to be connected with a Crisis Counselor. And because responding to someone can bring up hard emotions or be triggering, Crisis Text Line is also available to people who are reporting someone. From the other end, a live, trained Crisis Counselor receives the text and responds, all from a secure online platform. The individual then texts back and forth with the Crisis Counselor for as long as they need, while the counselor helps them sort through their feelings and thoughts by asking questions, empathizing, and actively listening. “We’re thrilled to be partnering with Reddit, where redditors can feel safe and supported by their community, 24/7,” said Bob Filbin, Co-Founder & Chief Data Scientist of Crisis Text Line. “Reddit has proven to be thoughtful leaders in the online safety space as they ensure users have access to trusted mental health resources at all times.” Reddit’s Commitment On Reddit, people are able to find community around an infinite number of topics relevant to them – and as an anonymous platform, we provide a space for people to express the most vulnerable parts of themselves. In addition to our partnership with Crisis Text Line, redditors find help in support communities that address a broad range of challenges people may face from quitting smoking or drinking, struggling to get pregnant, or addressing anxiety or depression. There are also entire communities dedicated solely to finding someone to talk to like r/KindVoice and r/CasualConversation. In addition to empowering people to connect and talk about the issues they face, Reddit is also committed to continually evaluating and evolving how to support communities dedicated to sensitive or personal topics. For instance, Reddit recently launched Crowd Control, a community setting that is based on a person’s relationship with a community. It allows communities to collapse comments from a user that is not yet established as trustworthy. Looking forward, Reddit will continue to evolve and invest in ongoing partnerships, products, and technology to support our users, communities, and their safety.

With more than 20 years of experience leading progressive HR organizations including at Netflix, Peshkov brings deep expertise and a values-driven approach to Reddit. Over the past several years, Reddit has grown to nearly 600 employees and solidified its footprint across five offices in San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, as well as its first international location, Dublin.

In that time, we’ve learned that Reddit chat facilitates fascinating discussion and that Reddit communities are a captivating window into humanity, human interests, and needs. Some Reddit communities are large, some are small, but each community on Reddit has its own requirements when it comes to real-time communication. Today, we’re excited to roll out subreddit and one-to-one chat to all users and communities. Years of testing have proven that these two new features will enhance engagement among redditors individually and within communities, lower the barrier for individual contribution, and speed up the response time for engagement. Reddit Chat in Our Ecosystem We know our users and communities want real-time communication, be it through live threads following international headlines in r/worldnews, game threads in r/NBA, or Bachelor watch parties in r/thebachelor. Subreddit and one-to-one chat allows users to connect, share, ask questions, follow live events, and collaborate in the moment. Subreddit chat also allows moderators to take advantage of and create countless chat rooms within their communities to encourage members to join live conversations on Reddit, for the very first time. A peek inside a r/BayArea subreddit chat room How We Built It We built Reddit chat in partnership with SendBird – who is powering the framework for one-to-one and subreddit chat – and with moderators, users, and community at the heart. We worked closely with moderators to develop moderation and internal safety tools for subreddit chat and collected feedback from users to make it easier for new users to join live conversations — another key benefit of these new chat functions. The user interface for one-to-one chat and subreddit chat How Chat Works Using intuitive prompts in the chat user interface, moderators can set up private chat rooms within their communities, invite additional members to participate, and even start public chats for all. To try one-to-one chat, users simply hover over a username and select the “start chat” button to initiate a chat, to which the other user can accept or decline and preview the message before responding. To try subreddit chat, mobile users can click to join via the top tab labeled “Room” in a subreddit and desktop users can click to join via the subreddit sidebar labeled “Chat Rooms”. Examples of how to join chat rooms displayed on the sidebar of a subreddit and the “start chat” prompt when hovering over another username What’s Next As you read this, Reddit one-to-one and subreddit chat are live and available to all communities and users. So look for a chat room in your favorite subreddit, send a fellow redditor a friendly message, and let us know what you think!

This marks the first time Reddit offers broadcaster partners visual access to our native polling feature. Reddit Polls limit the barrier to get started on Reddit and make it easier than ever for partners, media organizations, and redditors to contribute to their favorite communities. With the Tagboard integration, it opens up opportunities for broadcasters to tap into visualizing Reddit polling data like never before. The NFL Media Group was one of the first partners to take to Reddit Polls and incorporate audience reactions to the recently released NFL Top 100 list. The Reddit Polls Tagboard integration enables producers to incorporate diverse views from highly engaged audiences who have interest in the subject matter. Customization options within Tagboard also ensure that Reddit Polls match the branding of the rest of their programming.

Introduction Chairpersons, Ranking Members, Members of the Committee: Thank you for inviting me. My name is Steve Huffman. I am the co-founder and CEO of Reddit, and I’m grateful for this opportunity to share why Section 230 is critical to our company. Reddit uses a different model of content moderation from our peers—one that empowers communities—and this model relies on Section 230. I’m here because even small changes to the law will have outsized consequences for our business, our communities, and what little competition remains in our industry. 2. What Reddit is and how we approach content moderation My college roommate and I started Reddit in 2005 as a simple, user-powered forum to find news and interesting content. Since then, it’s grown into a vast, community-driven site, where millions of people find not just news and a few laughs, but also support, new perspectives, and a real sense of belonging. We don’t think of Reddit as social media, because social media revolves around individuals, while we’re organized around communities. These communities, which are centered upon everything from history and science to advice on relationships and parenting, are both created and moderated by users. Our model has taken years to develop, with many hard lessons along the way. As some of you know, I left the company in 2009, and for a time Reddit lurched from crisis to crisis over the questions of moderation we’re discussing today. In 2015, I came back because I realized the vast majority of our communities were providing an invaluable experience to our users, and Reddit needed a better approach to moderation. A. Approach to Moderation The way Reddit handles content moderation today is unique in the industry. We use a governance model akin to our own democracy—where everyone follows a set of rules, has the ability to vote and self-organize, and ultimately shares some responsibility for how the platform works. B. Content Policy First, we have our Content Policy,[1] the fundamental rules everyone on Reddit must follow. We set them ourselves at the corporate level. Think of these as our federal laws. They are principles-based and include things most everyone can agree on, such as prohibitions on harassment, sharing sexual images without consent, encouraging violence, sharing people’s private information, and other behaviors that have no place on our site. C. Community Rules & Volunteer Moderators Next, we have rules for what’s allowed in each community—our state laws, if you will. These are written and enforced not by Reddit employees, but by the community’s own volunteer moderators. These rules are tailored to the unique needs of its members, and tend to be far more specific than the “federal” rules we set. For example, one community devoted to open dialogue between users with different perspectives has a set of rules roughly the length of the US Constitution. Volunteer community moderators are empowered to remove any post that does not follow the community rules, without any involvement or direction from Reddit, Inc. The self-moderation our users do every day at this community level is the most scalable solution we’ve seen to the challenges of moderating content online. D. Upvotes & Downvotes Each individual user plays a crucial role as well, voting up or down on every post and comment. Through this system of voting, users can accept or reject any piece of content. While most platforms have some version of the upvote function, an action to convey approval or agreement, we at Reddit see the additional downvote as equally important. The downvote is where community culture is made, through rejecting transgressive behavior or low-quality content. If any community member, not just a moderator, sees poor quality content, they may downvote it, and as people do so, it becomes less visible, and in the case of a comment, disappears from the default view of the community. Thus, Reddit’s voting system essentially turns every user into a content moderator. Additionally, accrued upvotes and downvotes feed into the posting user’s reputation score, which we call “karma,” which is publicly visible to all other users. It’s an indicator of the constructiveness of a user’s participation on Reddit, and it’s possible for karma to be negative. Quantifying a user’s reputation in this way incentivizes good behavior. E. Moderation actions taken by Reddit, Inc. While this user-led system generally works well, we recognize that we as a company still have responsibilities, and we proactively work to ensure communities stay within our rules. Any user may report violations directly to a specialized group of employees at Reddit known as our “Anti-Evil” Team. Their role is to enforce the rules against malicious users, or take down particularly egregious content violations. We can take action against individual users (for example, through account suspensions), or against entire communities. We try to be as transparent as possible when we take such actions, and we publish our content policy enforcement actions annually in our Transparency Report. Our decisions are also appealable, and we likewise publish the appeal intake and acceptance rate in the Transparency Report.[2] Owing to these practices, we are proud that we were the only company to earn a perfect six-star rating from the Electronic Frontier Foundation in their annual “Who Has Your Back?” report on tech company transparency.[3] We also evolve our policies to ensure they keep up with reality. Since my return, we’ve made a series of updates addressing violent content, deepfaked pornography, controlled goods, and harassment. Nevertheless, like our democracy, the system isn’t perfect, though its effectiveness has improved with our efforts. An independent scholarly analysis of our 2015 banning of communities that didn’t abide by our policies showed these actions were largely effective in curbing bad behavior.[4] And when we investigated Russian attempts at manipulating our platform in 2016, we found that, of all accounts that tried, less than 1% made it past the routine defenses of our content policy, community moderation, and simple downvotes from everyday users.[5] While our model has improved the past few years, there is and will always be more to do and ways for us to improve, particularly as our communities grow and raise new and more complicated issues for us to solve. Section 230 is an instrumental tool in allowing us to do this work in good faith, without facing liability for it. 3. What does a world without 230 look like? This all begs the question of what Reddit (and the internet economy at large) would look like without Section 230. A. We wouldn’t be able to moderate First, all of the improvements in content moderation we’ve made over the past few years could not have happened, as these good-faith actions would expose us to liability. It’s worth noting how much the Reddit of today looks like the Prodigy of the early 90s, which raised the case that delivered 230. Perversely, because Prodigy had moderators who removed egregious content, they were held liable for all content. At the same time, other services, notably CompuServe, who didn’t make any attempts at moderating even the very worst content, were safe from legal consequences. This backwards incentive structure might have made sense in a pre-Internet age when publishers were dealing with much smaller amounts of content, but the sheer volume of content generated on internet platforms today means that all-or-nothing moderation simply isn’t feasible. For example, on average Reddit handles more than 750,000 posts and 6.3 million comments per day across over 130,000 active communities. B. Market competition considerations There are also market considerations for 230 that are especially applicable to a smaller company like Reddit. Even targeted limits to 230 will create a regulatory burden on the entire industry, benefiting the largest companies by placing a significant cost on smaller competitors. While we have 500 employees and a sizable user base—normally more than enough to be considered a large company—in tech today we are an underdog compared to our nearest competitors, who are public companies 10 to 100 times our size. Many of the conversations on revising 230 are premised on companies having the ability to moderate content from the center, in an industrialized model often reliant on armies of tens of thousands of contractors. Medium, small, and startup-sized companies don’t have the resources for this. This approach has questionable utility anyway, since even tens of thousands of contractors don’t scale with hundreds of millions of users, let alone billions. Indeed, the only thing that scales with users is users themselves, which is why we’ve empowered ours the way we have. But to speak even more fundamentally about competition and startups, I think back to the early days of Reddit. Had we been liable for every piece of content on Reddit, we would have been immediately vulnerable to lawsuits. And statistically speaking, most of those cases would not have been about the serious harms we are all concerned with—illicit drug sales, terrorist propaganda, and other issues—but rather defamation, which is far and away the largest class of suits dismissed on 230 grounds. Indeed, it was a $200 million defamation lawsuit that saddled Prodigy in the 230 origin story. We and others would be forced to defend against anyone with enough money to bankroll a lawsuit, no matter how frivolous, effectively enabling censorship through litigation. C. Human considerations Still, we recognize that there is truly harmful material on the internet, and we are committed to fighting it. But it’s important to understand that rather than helping, even narrow changes to 230 can undermine the power of community, chill discussion, and hurt the vulnerable. Take the opioid epidemic, which has been raised in discussions about 230. We have many communities on Reddit where users struggling with addiction can find support to help them on their way to sobriety. Were there to be a carve-out in this area, hosting them may simply become too risky, forcing us to close them down. This would be a disservice to people who are struggling, yet this is exactly the type of decision that restrictions to 230 would force on us. 4. Conclusion Section 230 is a uniquely American law with a balanced approach that has allowed the internet and platforms like ours to flourish, while incentivizing good faith attempts to mitigate the unavoidable downsides of free expression. While these downsides are serious and demand the attention of both us in industry and you in Congress, they do not outweigh the overwhelming good that 230 has enabled.

As we’ve grown up (we’re almost 15!), we’ve come to understand the evolving role our platform plays across generations. Gen Z (i.e. people born between 1997 and 2012) is changing the social media landscape and doing away with etiquette norms that have previously governed platforms. Gen Z creates, edits, posts, comments, likes and follows in ways that may feel completely unfamiliar to older generations. To better understand how younger audiences behave on social media, we worked with YPulse to gather research and create a comprehensive whitepaper on Gen Z and Millenial social media patterns. We learned that concepts like “Finsta” aka “Fake Instagram,” where a person has a second, private account dedicated to sharing their more personal moments with a small group of followers, are not born in a vacuum. They’re the result of young people striving to put their “real self” out there on social media — versus the highly curated image we’re accustomed to seeing — in order to create genuine connections both IRL and online. This yearning for connection is one reason why Gen Z makes up 26% of redditors*, some of which can’t be found on any other leading platforms. Why Gen Z Loves Reddit In a recent survey, 51% of Gen Z respondents said that they were attracted to the user-driven nature of Reddit**. Simply put, it’s real people talking about real things. “I love being able to see posts from real people who are genuine and helpful. I follow communities that can offer advice and guidance that I may need in certain areas of my life.” — Male 18-24 “There are no big influencers on Reddit and therefore I know when someone is talking about something it is because they are truly passionate about it.” — Female 18-24 They also visit Reddit communities to learn about specific topics they’re interested in, for example, r/MakeupAddiction, r/Minecraft, r/WorldPolitics and literally over a hundred thousand others. 87% of Gen Z respondents said there is a community for everyone on Reddit**, which we proudly agree with!

While elections tend to get the most attention, it is worth understanding the other Constitutional processes that impact our democracy. One of these is the US Census. Once every 10 years, the Census Bureau goes about counting every person living in the United States and its five territories. The result of that count affects the Electoral College, congressional representation, redistricting, demographic data, and the annual distribution of over $675 billion in federal funds.

Today we are announcing a special AMA series leading up to the 2020 Census. In the coming weeks, communities around Reddit will host AMAs with individual experts, civil rights groups, NGOs, and government agencies whose work touches on the census in some way.

The video ads product launched a new ad experience for our users, while improving engagement, targeting, performance-based bidding and measurement capabilities for advertisers. Today, we’re excited to build on that foundation with a bundle of improvements to our video ads product, including, mobile landing page experience, additional aspect ratios and optional referral URLs for CPV campaigns. NEW: Mobile Landing Page Experience To improve the video ads experience for both users and advertisers, we are enabling a new landing page on mobile that combines a seamless viewing experience with additional branding and product information that directs to the advertiser’s website. With this update, Reddit users who click an in-feed video ad will be taken to a website that will continue playing the video, uninterrupted, alongside other branding and marketing from the advertiser. We will offer the new landing page experience on all mobile video ads moving forward, regardless of the campaign objective, and expect that the update will improve engagement, particularly in completion and conversion rates. NEW: More Aspect Ratios We are introducing additional aspect ratios to our video ads product, enabling advertisers to increase engagement and save time by utilizing their video assets across platforms. With the rollout of our video ads improvement bundle, we now support 1:1 square and 4:5 vertical video in addition to 16:9 and 4:3 video formats. This means advertisers can now utilize cross-platform video assets — without having to recreate content specifically for Reddit ads — and will have more options to choose from. NEW: Optional Referral URLs for CPV Campaigns In addition to the new mobile landing page and aspect ratios, we’re now offering optional referral URLs for CPV campaigns, which will enable a cleaner video ad experience for campaigns with video views as the primary campaign objective. We expect these optional referral URLs will improve video ad results and enable a more friendly user experience. What This Means for Advertisers Native video continues to be a transformative format for Reddit, and we are excited to offer improvements to our video ads product that meet the needs of our advertisers as the platform evolves. With this bundle of updates, we’re also investing in the future of video ads for our business with the creation of Reddit’s first video engineering team. The video engineering team will be responsible for continuous testing and improvement to our video ads product.

In an era of distrust and perfectly-polished online personas, tools that are supposed to bring us together are often making us feel more isolated and distant from one another. At Reddit however, we’ve noticed something different. From page views to time spent on our site and apps, over the past year we’ve seen significant growth in user engagement and conversations—demonstrating that users are deepening their relationships with each other and with Reddit communities. Our users are finding more reasons to visit Reddit, more reasons to become active members of our communities, and more reasons to share the ideas they glean with others. Earlier this year, we partnered with YPulse to understand why Reddit is thriving among Gen Z and Millenials. They interviewed over 1,300 active social media users between the ages of 13-39 to better understand the role community plays in their lives, and the factors that have fueled more than a decade of community growth on Reddit. What we discovered was that community plays a unique and valuable role in the lives of our users. The power of community on Reddit is rooted in trust, the human desire to learn, and the need to feel belonging and work together to advance the collective. This is what drives the personal involvement and depth of sharing and response that we see across our user-propelled communities every day. In this study, we explore user feelings and behaviors on Reddit, how they lead to more authentic communication, what that means for our users’ openness to new ideas and cultural trends, and how that impacts real-world decisions. We learned that the best parts of humanity come alive with community, which gives us many reasons to feel optimistic about the future of the Internet.

Today we have services such as iMessage, WhatsApp, WeChat, and many more that allow millions of people to send and receive billions of messages each day. Unlike email services these systems are instantaneous and engaging. There is a sense of urgency and excitement surrounding the fast-paced nature of messaging back and forth. But words don’t always convey intentions, feelings, body language, social, and cultural signals. It becomes easier to take liberties on textual comments than to verbalize if the other person was standing in front of us. These types of conversations can evolve into spam or other categories that break a platform’s content policies. This might result in the quality of discussion being degraded and the users hesitating to engage with the platform. Machine learning to the rescue Wouldn’t it be nice if there were algorithms that automatically identified common topics of social interactions? For instance, if a computer could identify topics around sport, music, spam, and harassment without being explicitly told what any of those are. In terms of content moderation, this type of clustering would help reduce manual review time to action unwanted content. As someone who studied Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining at a graduate level, the landscape of AI and ML has changed significantly. Understanding the mathematical principles behind such machine learning (ML) algorithms was the only way forward at the time. Today’s tools have successfully managed to abstract the complexity to bring ML to the masses. I echo my mentor, and our former VP of Engineering, Nick Caldwell’s sentiment. He recently said: “Practically anybody can learn to be an ML engineer and attempt to replicate the first five years of my career in five days with modern toolkits” The Experiment Allow me to walk you through an experiment I conducted. I decided to analyze social conversations and understand what lies beneath the surface of “just words”. I extracted 2708 chat messages from 13 subreddit communities. These were the messages that were reported by users or moderators for further review. Here’s a quick overview of the two most common ML paradigms to help understand how machines learn from raw data. Supervised learning In supervised learning problems, we make use of datasets that contain training examples with associated correct labels. For example, if we had thousands of emails labeled as spam or not spam, we could train a model that can classify previously unseen emails as spam or not. Supervised learning is being used in a lot of our daily life activities, e.g., Depositing a check into your bank account by taking a picture with your smartphone app.Understanding speech by assistant systems. The big disadvantage of supervised learning is the time consuming and expensive preprocessing task of labeling the data. Unsupervised Learning In unsupervised learning techniques, we deal with data that has no associated labels. How could this be useful? Simple! Let the computer find commonalities in the dataset and base decisions on the presence or absence of such commonalities in new pieces of data. Unsupervised learning is particularly useful for categorizing (or clustering) unlabelled data. Not enough data? No problem! How many times have you heard that “we don’t have enough data, we need more” in order to make significant determinations? I wanted to challenge this common belief. It turns out that ML can actually be very valuable even if the data at our disposal is not exhaustive. Since the chat messages were not labeled, I wanted to rely on unsupervised learning methods. These algorithms provide the intuition one may need to explain the categorization. I’m talking about a collection of methods referred to as topic modeling. Topic modeling, as the name suggests, is a procedure for discovering topics from a collection of texts. Each topic represents a pattern of repeating word co-occurrences across the text corpus. For instance, in a good topic model, the word “president”, “minister” and “government” should all account for the topic about politics because they are often present together in the same text. Data Preprocessing When working with extracted texts in the natural language, it’s important to preprocess the data first. This is a very common process in Data Mining. Cleaning the data can significantly improve the performance of ML models, it reduces noise and is especially important when dealing with scarce datasets. Here is a list of preprocessing steps one might find useful: Tokenization – Splitting the chat messages into sentences and then the sentences into words.Normalizing cases – converting to a single case.Anonymizing data by removing Personal -PII data (e.g., email, url, username).Removing stopwords, such as the, is, at and on.Word stemming or lemmatization — reducing words to their root or lemma forms. Here are the two models I used for comparison analysis: Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorization Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic approach for automatically drawing two distributions – a distribution of words that describe each topic and a distribution of topics that describes each text. For applications in which people directly interact with emerged topics, LDA warrants strong consideration since the topics generated by LDA are more interpretable to humans compared to other topic modeling methods. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is another popular model for topic modeling which often works very well in practice. NMF factors the large document-word matrix (a matrix where rows correspond to document and columns correspond to words in our dictionary) into a product of two smaller matrices. The first matrix represents the discovered topics (clusters), while the second matrix represents the weight of each topic in the corresponding document. Number of topics Both LDA and NMF expect “number of topics” as an input parameter as part of the training. You can use your intuition, or gradually increase the number and test the model performance. Another way to assess the quality of the learned topics is through the coherence score, which measures the degree of semantic similarity between the most commonly occurring words in each topic. I was able to determine that the optimum number of topics for my experiment as 9. Training the model is very straight forward. There is a lot of help available online. scikit-learn has a nice example on how to perform topic extraction using the LDA and NMF models. Results In my experiments with ~2K chat messages extracted from different subreddits, LDA was more promising compared to NMF. NMF categorized more than half of the messages into one specific topic. On the other hand, LDA was able to distribute messages across all the 9 topics. Hence, I decided to further analyze the LDA model only. The next objective at this stage was to interpret the results and take a closer look at the most common words in each topic and manually label them. Note that now I’m only labeling 9 topics at most, whereas in supervised classification one would need to label ~2K pieces of text. This is important for several reasons. First and foremost, it reduces the time required for manual review of the data. It also identifies areas proactively that are more likely to require human review, so certain reports can be prioritized for more urgent review. In the same vein, spam can be proactively detected and removed before it degrades the user’s experience. And more broadly, it opens the door to learn more about communities norms and trends that could inform product and feature developments. Statistical Variance Machine learning engineers would know that the main problem of small datasets revolves around high variance. Though getting more data helps to reduce the variance, additional data is not always easy to get. The results of this experiment were sensitive to small fluctuations in the training set and parameter space. Consequently, I had to spend some time to carefully choose model parameters. Final Comments Unsupervised learning models can be of value even if you have a relatively small dataset. Topic modeling allowed me to take a bunch of messages and extract shared commonalities from the content. I was able to detect several specific topic categories without spending time annotating the content with specific labels. This demonstrates that certain ML paradigms can offer value in reducing manual review of content, using insights to prioritize moderation activity, and proactively identifying content that hinders the user experience.

Today, we’re excited to announce a new feature that puts the power of Awards in the hands of our communities: Community Awards. TL;DR Community Awards is an update to the Reddit Awards program that provides a new way for users to reward other users for posts and comments that elevate the conversation and culture within a given community. Unlike Reddit Silver, Gold and Platinum, however, Community Awards are customized and designed by communities, themselves, allowing a wider range of expression and interaction in line with the culture, jokes and content of those communities. Community Awards will become available to eligible communities starting on July 24. Designing Community Awards Community Awards are created and customized by moderator teams, who are able to select the icons, names, and Coin prices that best reflect their community’s culture. In some cases, mods may ask their communities to weigh in on designs and icons, before introducing new Community Awards to the group. Moderators can customize and offer up six new Awards for users to give, at price points ranging from 500 to 40,000 Coins. Rewarding Content with Community Awards Within participating communities, users have the option to give Community Awards through the standard awarding process. When a user clicks on the “Give Award” button, Community Awards for that community will appear alongside the existing Reddit Silver, Gold and Platinum Award options. Because Community Awards are customized by the mods of individual communities, they are only available for awarding within the community for which they were created — for instance, the Mind-Blown award (below) can only be awarded within the r/IAmA community. Community Response Community Awards is a product many months in the making. After building an early version of Awards, we reached out to moderators from r/nba, r/MurderedbyWords, r/science and others to collect feedback, iterate and build an Awards experience that would feel customized and relevant for all Reddit communities. Over the past several months, we’ve worked closely with moderators and users to continue testing the feature, and have been surprised, once again, by the creativity of our communities. On r/DunderMifflin, the mods have turned series-long inside jokes — like Jim’s classic stapler-in-the-Jell-o prank — into individual awards. On r/nba, the mods have found ways to incorporate their community’s culture of data analysis and statistics with the “Apt Analysis” Award, which was one of the first examples on the platform. We’re excited to offer Community Awards more widely and see what else our communities come up with. What’s Next In the coming weeks, Community Awards will become available to all eligible communities as we help onboard as many new communities as possible.

Last year, we were proud to be among the top-ranked companies, with 4 out of 5 stars. But we wanted that last star. Bad. So a coalition of teams inside Reddit got together to determine how we could do better for this year. And we are delighted to share that the new 2019 ratings came out this week with Reddit in the top spot! Furthermore, not only did we earn all 6 out of 6 stars, but we were the only company to do so! This accomplishment represents the culmination of many people’s work, some of which you may have noticed in the past few months. You might have seen, for example, our newly-expanded Transparency Report, which for the first time this year provided statistics not just on government data and takedown requests, but also information on content that we as Reddit admins removed for sitewide-rule violations. We also included for the first time stats on appeals for these takedowns, earning us that coveted sixth star. While disclosing these figures might not seem like a big deal, tracking and gathering all of that information is a complex job, and it takes a lot of our small team’s effort to do it. We’re proud that we were able to pull it off, even when companies with literally dozens of times as many employees as us couldn’t. Values and practices that privilege transparency are important to us, and we know they’re important to Redditors, too. That’s why we made these improvements a priority, and we’ll continue to look for ways to be more transparent with you whenever we can. We’re already examining our practices for next year, in the hopes that we can continue to exemplify practices that set a standard for the industry and are respectful of our users. To that end, if you have some ideas on what statistics you’d like to see in future transparency reports, let us know in the comments! Finally, a word of thanks to the EFF. Reports like these help pull companies like us (and the entire industry) along in our practices, and we know they’re complex to put together. We’re grateful for the work EFF does, not only on this issue, but on a whole host of issues critical to the open internet. Check out their work on CDA 230, or how they helped us protect this Redditor’s First Amendment right to anonymous speech– legal pushback which, by the way, was made possible by Reddit’s transparency notification processes on government data requests….so yeah, this stuff matters."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/on-june-11-the-senate-will-discuss-net-neutrality","date":"2019-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"On June 11, the Senate will Discuss Net Neutrality. Call Your Senator, then Watch the Proceedings LIVE.","text":"Hey, Redditors! Since we last checked in with you on Net Neutrality, the House of Representatives passed the Save the Internet Act to restore strong Net Neutrality rules. As a reminder, this bill includes consumer protections that prevent internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking or throttling content, as well as from the anticompetitive practice of prioritizing certain content in exchange for payment. These protections are essential, as evidence shows that ISPs have been taking advantage of their absence to execute some unfair practices since the repeal, documented here. In light of this disappointing-but-unsurprising shadiness, we’ve continued to beat the drum on why Net Neutrality is important to allowing platforms like Reddit (as well as all manner of startups) to compete on an even playing field with industry giants. u/spez even teamed up recently with FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel (u/Official_FCC_CJR) and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo to emphasize Net Neutrality’s continued urgency. What’s happening now, and what can you do? The Senate version of the bill, sponsored by u/SenatorEdMarkey, is now poised to be raised on the floor on (likely) June 11– timed exactly one year after the FCC officially retracted the Net Neutrality rules that were previously in place. You’ll be able to watch the proceedings live here. But in order for this effort to have a chance, our Senators need to know that this is something their constituents care about. While the polling is bipartisan and overwhelmingly in favor of Net Neutrality, polling doesn’t speak as loudly as constituent phone calls. In the words of Rep. Eshoo, “Advocates need to lean in…The Congress is not a proactive institution. Congress moves when it’s pushed from the outside.” You can let your Senator know that you care about Net Neutrality by giving their office a call before the 11th. You can look yours up and find their phone number here (you have two of them, so be sure to call both!). You might also want to check and see how they fared in this incidence of spontaneous Reddit activism from late 2017 (unfortunately, word from his staff is that Senator Dog will not be taking part in Tuesday’s floor proceedings due to his preoccupation with impending Universal Basic Tennis Ball legislation).

Gale currently serves as Chief Marketing Officer at Personal Capital and is an established executive, advisor, and author with more than 20 years of direct-to-consumer marketing for brands spanning AdTech, FinTech, Gaming, CPG, and e-commerce industries. Previously, Gale was Vice President of Marketing at Virgin America and managed its Brand & Digital, Loyalty and In-Flight content teams. She also helped build and grow Globality, an AI-driven SaaS platform and marketplace, as Marketing General Manager and interim CMO. She’s widely recognized for her marketing leadership, having been named on AdAge’s Digital Hotlist, an iMedia Top 25-Digital Marketer, and receiving the Changing The Game Award by AWNY. “Porter has extensive experience building bold, fast-growing companies that put their customers and users first”, said Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. “We look forward to the insights and experience Porter will bring to the board, as Reddit continues to pursue its mission of bringing community and belonging to everyone.” “Reddit’s network of passionate communities offers people social substance that is entirely unique from anywhere else on the internet. So much of what people find online today is self-promotion or driven by influence, when what people want and need is authenticity and this substantive social experience,” said Gale. “This is why I was drawn to Reddit and why I’m eager to be part of the company’s journey.” This appointment follows several major milestones for the company. In February, the company closed a 300M Series D round to fuel its mission to bring community and belonging to everyone. This year, Reddit has also opened a new office in Dublin, and expanded hiring in New York to continue growth beyond its San Francisco headquarters and offices in Los Angeles and Chicago. The company has also made a number of key leadership hires including Time-Veteran Jen Wong as Chief Operating Officer and Shariq Rizvi, as Vice President of Ads Product and Engineering. All of this has fueled product momentum, beginning with the site’s redesign in 2018 and encompassing several new ad products."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-global-meetup-is-coming-set-your-calendars-for-june-22-2019","date":"2019-04-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Reddit Global Meetup is coming!

Each year in June, redditors just like yourself gather in parks, restaurants, beaches, active roadways (yes, really), to mingle and be jovial, celebrating one common theme amongst them all—Reddit! Meeting redditors IRL is an exciting opportunity to expand your online purview, share favorite communities, and debate on whether that hot dog you’re currently eating is a taco or a sandwich. What do you think u/Spez? It’s true that redditors do meetups around the world all the time! When like-minded redditors get together, it’s usually a lot of fun. But June is the one special time of year when we go all-out and really show up, from Canada to India, Japan, and Australia, with hundreds of cities in between. What started in 2009 (now in its TENTH YEAR!) has become a true Reddit tradition for all redditors to bring their conversations from online to IRL. This year, we’re celebrating our ninth annual Reddit Meetup Day on Saturday, June 22. If this is your first meetup, bring your best self and expect a good time in great company. r/Auckland (Photo by u/onceyougoasian) And by the way, Global really does mean GLOBAL! Thanks to this thread nine years ago, we were able to spread the news to Reddit communities in all parts of the world. That means you can find meetups in cities like Pune, Bangkok, and Buenos Aires. We also have meetups in Iloilo, London, and Vegas! If you’re looking for your city, or are vacationing during Reddit Meetup Day, check out our list of community subbies!

Reddit has had a year of great momentum. On the product front, we rolled out our largest redesign ever, grew native video to 1B views per month, and expanded Reddit Coins with new Award options. Behind the scenes, we’ve scaled our Anti-Evil team’s proactive detection of attempted content manipulation to 99% (i.e. 99% of violations are actioned before a report is ever filed), and shared our Annual Transparency Report. To support our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone, we want to continue this momentum by investing in the growth of our teams. Ireland, and Dublin specifically, is a hub of engineering and product talent that is well suited for the teams we will expand. This combined with the region’s proven track record as a hub for scaling technology companies will allow us to strengthen Reddit’s longstanding commitment to the integrity of our site and the privacy of our users. “Reddit is a high-profile, rapidly growing company and its choice of Dublin as the location for its first international office is really great news,” said Martin Shanahan, CEO, IDA Ireland. “Dublin is an established tech hub within Europe and Reddit was attracted by the wealth of expertise available here.” The new office space will be located in Dublin 2, overlooking St. Stephen’s Green. We plan to build out our Anti-Evil, Security, Community, and Engineering teams with two dozen new roles in 2019. These teams are responsible for ensuring the integrity, security, and health of our communities. They will work on core product development, site and user account security, and engineering solutions to detect and prevent policy-breaking content – while also adding additional capacity for those teams’ coverage across time zones. “We’ve always taken the approach that our users’ safety and privacy matters,” says Reddit CTO Chris Slowe. “As our first international office, we chose Dublin to tap into the tech talent pool and extend our efforts focused on the health of the platform and user experience.” If you’re interested in joining our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone, check out our Careers Page for a list of open positions."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/celebrating-game-of-thrones-on-reddit","date":"2019-04-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Celebrating Game of Thrones on Reddit","text":"By William Cline (u/sodypop) For the past several weeks, Reddit HQ has been buzzing with excitement about the final season of Game of Thrones, with some teams even hanging their favorite house sigils over their desks. Each Monday, staff can be spotted darting to quiet corners, whispering watercooler banter, dire not to utter a spoiler too loudly. Now, that would be a shame. This is an excitement we share with you, the Reddit community. And for good reason: Game of Thrones has been king of our vast realms of television fandom communities since the show’s beginnings. Whether you’re seeking in-depth episode discussions for any season, conversations about the written text or checking out the folks with the dankest of GoT memes, we’ve got a community for any Game of Thrones fan to call home. r/GameofThrones Community With over two million subscribers, r/gameofthrones has been the largest TV community on Reddit seven out of the last eight years. Since 2011, redditors have flocked to this community to discuss out-of-the-box fan theories, the latest mind-bending plotlines and their favorite show moments. This year has been no different, where we’ve seen over 1.5M comments within the community around the show’s last season. The r/gameofthrones community has always been vocal about their favorite—and sometimes least favorite—characters on the show. To celebrate the long-awaited series finale, we partnered with the community to give redditors an opportunity to show that fan passion in the spirit of the final season’s ultimate battle: the fight to win the Iron Throne. The Throne Pool To kick off season eight, Reddit launched a Throne Pool experience with the r/gameofthrones community, where redditors were encouraged to “bend the knee” for the character they wanted to see take the Iron Throne at the end of the season. Once a character was selected, redditors were entered into that character’s dedicated community to post memes, theories and chit-chat with other bannermen that shared their predilections. Over 1.3M redditors have bent the knee and aren’t shying away from making their alliances known. As the season progressed, we implemented a few unique changes to the experience in response to episode plotlines and character traits (like when we gave the first 62 users that bent the knee for r/LyannaWinsTheThrone an “Original 62” flair). We also setup alliances so that bannermen of allied characters could post in each other’s communities (Team Arya and Sansa, anyone?). Of course, after the show is over we’ll be awarding some special trophies to winners and losers alike. But who will be the victor? Will it be a fan favorite like that know-nothing Jon Snow, who has seen a 25 percent increase in Throne Pool supporters? Or will another character emerge from the shadows? Thousands of redditors seem to think Sansa may claim the final seat; she’s received four times the amount of backers since the beginning of the season! While we’ll have to wait until the finale for the true winner to be revealed, you can check out the most popular choices from redditors in our leaderboard on the r/gameofthrones sidebar on desktop (redesign only)! And, if you haven’t caught up with the finale (why are you reading this then?) there’s still time to relive season 8 (or the entire series) with the r/gameofthrones community episode threads and collections.

Hear Directly from Members of Congress at 8pm ET TODAY on Reddit, and Learn What You Can Do to Save Net Neutrality!","text":"As you all know, one of our biggest causes is supporting measures that help preserve the free and open internet, which is under threat worldwide from those who want to exercise more control over how you access the web at large. We don’t think that’s right, and feel strongly that users should be able to access all websites (including Reddit!) with equal ease and speed. No one—not the government, and not ISPs—should interfere in what sites you choose to visit. The concept of Net Neutrality enshrines that principle. But unfortunately, in 2017, the FCC decided to overturn existing rules in favor of Net Neutrality, making it easier for ISPs to channel you toward content that benefits their bottom line. Nevertheless, there have been a number of legislative efforts to try and restore Net Neutrality rules, and the newest one is making real waves. The Save the Internet Act would enshrine the principles of Net Neutrality into law, preventing internet service providers from blocking or throttling websites, or from allowing paid prioritization (that is, creating paid “fast lanes” for the big guys who can afford it, or for other content ISPs have an interest in). As internet service providers increasingly swallow up the content industry, the temptations grow to funnel consumers toward content that benefits their bottom line, harming competition and closing off the web. (Don’t believe us? Head over here to Columbia Journalism Review’s “Who Owns What?” index and take a gander under the “Comcast” or “Time Warner” tabs). In a perfect world, if Americans had more choice between service providers, this might not be such an issue. But the reality is that more than 100 million Americans—many in rural areas—have only one option when it comes to how they get their internet at home. Accordingly, we need to protect Net Neutrality. Congressional AMA TODAY at 8pm with Congressman McNerney We support the Save the Internet Act, and are excited that it will be up for a full vote on the House floor tomorrow! We’re even more excited that we will be joined by Congressman Jerry McNerney of California (and maybe a few other guests), one of the bill’s co-sponsors, to take your questions about the bill directly in an AMA happening TODAY in r/politics at 8pm ET. Be sure to check it out! What else can I do? If Net Neutrality is something you care about, be sure to spread the word. The most important thing you can do is to call your member of Congress and let them know that you’ll be watching their vote tomorrow. (If you don’t know who your representative is, you can look them up here and find their contact information– you might also want to see whether they appeared in this instance of spontaneous community action on Reddit). Also, be sure to tell a friend! Many people still aren’t aware of the fight for Net Neutrality, and don’t realize that it will impact them in very real ways– especially those Americans living in rural areas who have the least choice when it comes to internet service providers. (Check out the comments on this post, where Redditors told us all about how Net Neutrality impacts them). Finally, take some time today to continue to educate yourself about Net Neutrality and why it matters. In addition to the upcoming AMA with Rep. McNerney, we have some great past AMAs on the issue from other members of Congress including Congressman Mike Doyle (Pennsylvania), Senator Ed Markey (Massachusetts), and Senator Brian Schatz (Hawaii). We also have one from FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, and some California firefighters who had a scary moment last year fighting the wildfires when Verizon decided to throttle their network. We feel the momentum in the fight for Net Neutrality, and we hope you will too! We’ll continue to keep you updated with how things progress."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/error-copyright-not-detected-what-eu-redditors-can-expect-to-see-today-and-why-it-matters","date":"2019-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"ERROR: COPYRIGHT NOT DETECTED. What EU Redditors Can Expect to See Today and Why It Matters","text":"We’ve spent a lot of time in the past year sharing updates and information on proposed changes to the EU Copyright Directive. Even though Reddit is an American company, we’d be highly impacted by changes to the law, as would our European users. It could even impact the availability of services we provide to non-EU users. At its heart, changes to the law (known as Article 13), would force us to proactively confirm that the OP of any given post has the necessary copyright permissions to share it– something functionally impossible without installing automated content filters. Another part of the law, known as Article 11, would also force a change in how we process link posts, and could even impact discussions of specific news articles. Such regulations would create a chilling effect that penalizes smaller platforms and creators in favor of the large companies and media conglomerates that are already employing (or selling) automated content filters (to disastrous effect). But don’t just take our word for it. Check out what the guy at the UN whose literal job it is to protect free expression worldwide has to say about it. This is a business issue for us– make no mistake. The passage of the new EU Copyright Directive would seriously impact Reddit’s ability to compete in the market against bigger players. But it’s also about more than that. Throughout our history, we have stood up against legislative efforts around the world that threaten to make the internet more closed, whether it was fighting against SOPA/PIPA in the US, or against the repeal of net neutrality protections. What is most disappointing about the current EU Copyright Directive is the closed and opaque process by which we got here. Activists and normal netizens have been left out as things have kicked from backroom deal to backroom deal. Citizens exercising their right to be heard have been denigrated by those in power as “the mob.” There have been attempts to reschedule plenary votes as a means of pre-empting civil society demonstrations. Despite these headwinds, you’re all doing incredible things to make your voices heard, whether through direct protests or by presenting the largest petition in history. Right here on Reddit, communities are actively discussing the Directive’s pros and cons in a civil and informed way that many (incorrectly) say isn’t possible on the internet anymore. And today, we’re joining together with platforms, creators, and civil society on Action Week against the Directive. What’s Happening? Starting today, March 21 (Brussels time!), when Reddit desktop users in EU countries attempt to make a top-level post on Reddit, they will be met by a simulated error message citing failure to confirm the copyright on their post (don’t worry, in actuality, your post will be fine). This experience, meant to mimic the automated filters that users would encounter should the Directive pass, will last through March 23rd, when IRL demonstrations are planned across Europe. This is all leading up to the final Plenary vote on the Directive in the EU Parliament likely next week (though exact date still TBC). What Can You Do? We hope that our EU users will take this opportunity to educate themselves and get involved. Most important is to contact your MEP (be civil and polite when explaining your point). You could also participate in one of the demonstrations this weekend– check here for one that is near you. Or, you could read up on the issues and share your point of view right here on Reddit. The bottom line is that the internet works better when it’s open. While copyright reform is important, it shouldn’t come at the expense of everyday people’s ability to express themselves online."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/evolution-of-push-notifications-at-reddit","date":"2019-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Technology"],"title":"Evolution of Push Notifications at Reddit","text":"Arjun Bhargava, Paul Booth, Taylor Hudson, Saurabh Sharma, Kevin Zhang The World of Push Notifications Reddit released the first versions of its in-house mobile applications in 2016, and with this came new ways to showcase the communities and cat pics we offer the world. Notably, this included the ability to send push notifications to Redditors directly through the apps, so we were excited to explore this grand opportunity to help users discover the delight and sense of belonging we could bring them. In fact, research has shown that push notifications can result in people visiting an app 88% more frequently and users that opt in to push notifications come back to the app at nearly twice the rate of those who don’t. Additionally, research has indicated that about 50% of mobile app users find push notifications helpful, so we also had a chance to help even hardcore users use Reddit more easily. Push notifications, if used correctly, can have multiple benefits for users: they help notify users of relevant content, allow users to benefit from Reddit without needing to open the app, and enable users to discover new ways in which to engage with their communities.. Starting with the Basics Reddit is a daily destination to millions of people all over the world who come to find discussion and content they’re interested in. We wanted our push notifications to be an extension of that. Fundamentally, we wanted to build a feature that enhances the aspects of Reddit that brighten our users’ day and helps them connect with other people and communities. To that end, we began by building out the ability to send notifications based on user-driven events that we thought people would want to know about, such as: Replies to your commentsReplies to your postsMentions of your usernamePrivate messages (including gold and moderator notifications)Chat messages We thought starting with this would help bring focus to discussion and community on Reddit. We made sure that users could control what notifications they received, but our hypothesis was that many would find it helpful to be notified and would find using Reddit even more rewarding with them. We built this as an experiment to test that hypothesis, and monitored for community feedback to see what people were saying about them. The data overall was very positive: Redditors who liked the discussion features of Reddit found it helpful to find out through notifications about how their discussions were going. Once we were confident that notifications could be useful to people who were already highly engaged with Reddit communities, we began experimenting with something that would help people discover new things on Reddit. This called for a new notification based on our own signals rather than user-driven actions, and because of that we knew it would be much more difficult to get right. The idea seemed simple: we should send users something on Reddit they would be interested in. But the next question wasn’t simple: How do we do it? The Right Stuff When we first set out to introduce these push notifications to our users, we knew their success or failure would hinge on a simple question: With so much content submitted every day, how do we choose what to send any given person through a notification? We didn’t want to waste our users’ time by sending them something they don’t care about, but we couldn’t ask every single person what is the one Reddit post they would be most interested in. (At least, not without seriously overworking our user research folks.) Our initial approach was to use a process called “explore/exploit,” in which we collected an array of recently posted Reddit content each morning that passed a certain threshold of upvotes and engagement, and sent a notification from that pool to a small set of users (20%). (We only sent users posts from subreddits they had subscribed to.) From those posts, we tracked which ones had the highest rates of users opening the notification within a few hours, and then sent out a post from that subset to the rest of our users. (Math-oriented folks will recognize this approach as an example of the classic [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit](multi-armed bandit) problem.) Essentially we started from a position of “exploring” which content could potentially be the most engaging, and once we had some idea of an answer, we “exploited” that knowledge to send the best content. The results bore this approach out: users opened notifications sent from the “exploit” phase at consistently higher rates than those from the “explore” phrase. And our overall click-through rate was even higher than industry-average! So we kept running this system for over a year, making changes based on user feedback. If You Send It, They Will Come One change we made proved especially fruitful: Initially we had only sent notifications from a curated list of popular subreddits. But after a while this approach didn’t make much sense – the list contained subreddits that dropped off in activity as time went on, such as r/HouseOfCards and r/skyrim. To stay relevant we would need to continuously add new communities to reflect the changing interests of Redditors. It also meant smaller, more specialized communities would never get included, even if those were in fact the thing that would be the most interesting to a given user. We realized we were trying to do too much work when our users had already answered the question for us – one thing Redditors tend to be good at is cultivating their own experience to match what they’re interested in. So we ran an experiment: instead of using a curated list and matching that against a user’s subscribed communities, we instead sent people something that could come from _any_ of their subscribed communities that met a certain activity threshold, and excluding controversial or hot-button communities. (We also maintained a long-standing rule about not sending out NSFW content or posts with objectionable text. We don’t want anyone to be surprised in a bad way by what they get in a notification.) The results were positive – sending people something they had already expressed an interest in was clearly better than trying to filter for them preemptively. It was so successful that the decision to adopt it as our new standard was easy. But as successful as the experiment was, putting it in place had proven cumbersome and solidified some of the core weaknesses in the explore/exploit system. Because the system had been initially built out as a quick experiment, it was difficult to change many of the baked-in assumptions, such as the right time to begin sending notifications or how to collect the initial “exploration” pool of posts. We also found that as Reddit continued to grow through 2018, the time it took our system to figure out what to send for every user stretched longer and longer, which meant the notifications were getting increasingly stale by the time they were received. We also knew that there were countless other ways we wanted to iterate to find even more personalized content to send, and we continued to strive towards the ideal goal of sending the perfect post to each Reddit user at the exact right time. But we wouldn’t be able to keep running experiments when making any change would take weeks of work, so we knew we had to find something that could replace the long-standing explore/exploit system with something better. Could we find such a thing? The Answer was Right in Front of Us… We built a new content selection system based on an already existing idea: the same algorithm that powers what logged-in Redditors see by default when they visit their Reddit home page. This algorithm, also known as best sort, was designed to offer each Redditor an optimized window into the discussions they find the most interesting. Our recommendation system weighs multiple signals, such as the age of a post and the amount of votes, by machine learning algorithms to output an optimized ranking of posts specific to that person and moment in time. Using this algorithm, we would have better content (fresher, more recent posts) and a better way to map that to what a person would be interested in. By implementing this new system, we bypassed many of the assumptions and limitations baked into our older notification system, and were able to iterate more quickly. As always, we tested it experimentally, and saw results that exceeded even our most optimistic expectations – sending posts that were already highly tailored to each user by mirroring their homepage experience was extremely successful. With this, our architecture took a big step towards our ultimate goal of helping users more easily find community and belonging. What’s next? Of course, even that system isn’t perfect, and we’re constantly iterating on our push notifications system to aim for the ultimate goal of helping everyone find their home on Reddit. Push notifications have drastically evolved over the last two years from user-driven push notifications to machine-learning models that deliver what you would see on your home feed. While these experiments have already shown success helping people find the value of Reddit, we’re excited about what’s to come! We are exploring more ways to connect people with Reddit such as browser notifications and emails, and improving our existing notifications to be more personalized and timely. Anything you would like to see in the next evolution of Push Notifications? Come help us build it! We’re Hiring.

Today, we’re excited to build on that foundation with two additional offerings that help optimize Reddit Ads for performance advertisers: App Install as a campaign objective and a vastly improved Conversion Pixel with expanded capabilities for tracking and measurement. NEW: App Install as a Campaign Objective Built on top of the foundation we laid with Cost Per Click ads, App Install ads appeal to mobile-first advertisers looking to grow their mobile user base. Now, advertisers can select ‘App Install’ as their campaign objective and Reddit will enhance ad performance to drive App Store visits. When advertisers choose ‘App Install’ as their campaign objective, we now directly target Reddit’s mobile app users with native mobile ads, allow advertisers to bid per click (meaning advertisers only pay if the ad converts to an app store visit) and target iOS or Android users (or both) and direct clicks to the app store URL. With the rollout of App Install ads, we’ve also updated our reporting capabilities through integrations with seven of the leading app install attribution providers, including: Adjust, Tune, Appsflyer, Kochava, Tenjin, Singular and Branch. Now, advertisers can track and monitor impressions and click data directly in their attribution provider’s dashboard. NEW: Improved Conversion Pixel In addition to new performance bid types and campaign objectives, we’re thrilled to share our vastly improved Conversion Pixel with expanded capabilities for tracking and measurement. Previously, the Reddit Ads Conversion Pixel could track only one conversion event, coupled view-through and click-through conversions together and did not allow attribution window configuration. Today, Reddit’s improved Conversion Pixel: Tracks eight different conversion events, including ‘Page Visit,’ ‘View Content,’ ‘Search,’ ‘Add to Cart,’ ‘Add to Wishlist,’ ‘Purchase,’ ‘Lead,’ and ‘Sign Up’Breaks out view-through and click-through conversions separatelyProvides 1, 7, or 28-day attribution windowsShows conversion data on new conversion tabWhat this means for advertisers With the rollout of the performance bundle, we now offer five different campaign objectives––reach, video view, traffic, conversions and App Install––associated with a complete suite of bid types, including CPM, CPV and CPC. With the launch of CPC, App Install as a campaign objective and the improved Conversion Pixel, advertisers can now bid on, optimize and report on their direct response objectives. This performance-focused product bundle is a tremendous step toward continued improvement and advancement of our performance offering. Throughout 2019, we will be introducing more advanced optimization and targeting offerings.

Facilitating that growth has taken a lot of behind-the-scenes evolution of Reddit’s backend infrastructure. One major component has been adopting a service-oriented architecture, and a significant facet of that has been evolving service-to-service discovery and communication. As the number of services has grown, so has the complexity in how they interact with each other and legacy systems. Instead of debugging function and module calls within a monolithic application, engineers now need insight about RPCs among multiple services. Instead of focusing on common problems like exception handling and bad input, engineers also have to consider client request behaviors and defend appropriately with retry-handling, circuit-breaking and granular route control. Recently, we rolled out Envoy as our service-to-service L4/L7 proxy as part of our efforts to address these new and ever-growing needs for developing and maintaining stable production services. In this blog, we’ll provide insight into Reddit’s service communication beginnings, why and how we chose Envoy as well as how we approached and managed deployment of the tool given our infrastructure constraints. Mesh Up: Reddit’s Service Discovery Foundation Ever since we started building out new services and splitting features out from our monolith, Reddit’s backend infrastructure has been operating within a very basic service mesh powered by Airbnb’s SmartStack. Much of the reasoning behind SmartStack’s design choices and use cases mapped to our own architecture, making it a natural fit for our transition into the new world of service-oriented infrastructure. A brief overview of this architecture is important as the groundwork was pivotal in how we approached our eventual migration to Envoy and greatly reduced the difficulty of the task itself. Today, the majority of our services run on AWS EC2 instances in AutoScaling Groups. As service instances come and go throughout the day, registration happens with a SmartStack component called Nerve. Nerve is a Ruby process that runs as a sidecar on each of these instances and registers the instance into a central Zookeeper cluster. The service application is responsible for constructing a useful health-check to determine registration status. Most of our services are instrumented with a common framework called Baseplate that provides shared tooling like a health-check interface, which makes interfacing with Nerve straightforward and abstracted to the service developer. The other component to a basic service mesh is discovery, the process that makes new downstream services available to be called by upstream client services. Like Nerve, Synapse is a per-instance Ruby process that manages service endpoint discovery. Synapse reads the Zookeeper registry that Nerve populates, writes endpoint entries to a local HAProxy configuration file. HAProxy runs as a sidecar process, handling proxying and load-balancing downstream service traffic. While much of our service architecture has been constantly changing, Reddit’s SmartStack deployment has remained relatively unchanged and operationally stable throughout its three-year lifetime. The service registry provided by Nerve has been used for other internal tooling, such as checking for unhealthy AWS instances and monitoring bootstrapping of new hosts. Despite this stability and familiarity, our evolving systems started pushing against the limits of what’s immediately available with SmartStack, so we decided to evaluate the service mesh landscape and determine if it’d be beneficial to replace it with new technologies. One Mesh More: Moving To Envoy As our service architecture has evolved over the last few years, there were several places in SmartStack where we started to feel pain, primarily around the lack of control for the individual components. Nerve and Synapse only accept static configurations, so any service registration updates––such as adding or removing a service––required Puppet configuration changes and updates across a service fleet. Synapse’s configuration writer for HAProxy provided only basic routing definitions and we had minimal levels of observability for the traffic going through HAProxy since it didn’t understand our primary internal protocol, Thrift. Service-to-service behavior was also increasing in complexity, and we were noticing developers trying to enforce complicated communication behaviors in application code. Every application was starting to manage its own retry-handling, timeouts, and circuit-breaking to downstream services in its own code, and it got to the point where a service had four or five upstream clients with different behaviors against the same endpoint. We knew this would not scale and wanted to explore the possibility of managing that in a shared communication layer like our network proxy. Now that we had defined a destination that we wanted to reach with our service mesh, we needed to figure out the road that would fit Reddit’s the best. We evaluated many proxy and mesh options, focusing on the following characteristics when weighing tradeoffs: Performance: Avoid adding a performance bottleneck at all costs. Any performance losses at the proxy level need to be offset by considerable feature gains. The two biggest considerations here were resource utilization and latency impact. Our mesh approach accounts for a sidecar proxy on every host, so we wanted the solution to be one that we were comfortable running on every host and at every hop in the network.Features: The biggest differentiator among the options was the possibility of L7 Thrift support in the proxy. Thrift is our main inter-service RPC protocol and without first-class support for the behavior control we want in a service mesh, it wouldn’t make sense to switch to something that would just be providing the same basic TCP load balancing we’re getting out of HAProxy. We’ll address this in the next section.Integrations and Extensibility: Being able to contribute or request integrations and possibly extend out-of-the-box functionality was also a core requirement. The network proxy needed to be able to evolve with Reddit’s service needs and developer feature requests. Envoy and its ecosystem fit all of these requirements with tradeoffs that we decided would be worth the migration. While we’d have to dramatically change our service discovery stack and get comfortable running an entirely new traffic proxy in production, the low footprint and extensibility potentials, especially with future Thrift filters, were big opportunities for our infrastructure evolution. With a well-defined feature-set goal and implementation choice made, the hard part was done. Next came the harder part of actually deploying and using it in production. HAProxy Replaced: First Steps with Envoy As mentioned before, HAProxy functioned as the service traffic proxy in Reddit’s SmartStack deployment, and within that deployment it could only manage traffic at L4. A great deal of Envoy’s advanced feature set that differentiated it for us was its L7 control. At the time, there was already mature functionality for HTTP and gRPC, but Reddit services primarily communicate using Thrift. The first thing we needed to get started on was ensuring that Envoy had a Thrift story. At this time, Turbine Labs had just announced their Envoy support and plans to develop products for Envoy, and we noticed that they were actively contributing to Envoy. We reached out to them about the possibility of contracting development of Thrift support in Envoy, and over the next four months, the partnership brought Thrift support into Envoy proper, contributing a basic Thrift-aware proxy, routing, request/response metrics, and rate-limiting. In parallel, internally we were focused primarily on setting the foundation for deploying and running Envoy with our production services. Without internal service communication depending on this layer, we had to be extra careful in trying to change even just one part of the system, let alone the entire thing. After a good deal of consideration, we settled upon replacing HAProxy with Envoy with basic TCP proxying support as the minimum viable first steps while Thrift capabilities were being built out. Operationally, we would still use Nerve and Synapse to handle service registration and discovery which meant changing fewer moving pieces at once. The tradeoff here was that we wouldn’t be using Envoy’s preferred mode of operation, using dynamic discovery services, out of the box. To deal with this, we wrote a custom ConfigGenerator plugin in Synapse for writing Envoy configurations and also additional configuration scripts and tooling for Synapse itself to manage Envoy using its hot-restart mechanism. This effort allowed us to keep most of our service discovery system intact while still operationalizing Envoy in production, which in turn gave us a good deal of flexibility with the migration itself. We could roll out the proxy change to each service one at a time and control rollout of Envoy usage on a per-instance basis by changing application configurations to use Envoy-specific endpoints for downstream communication. During the migration process, we ran both HAProxy and Envoy in parallel, listening on different ports, with Synapse writing configurations for both proxies. This enabled us to perform per-service migrations for the client, observe behavior, and roll back immediately with a straightforward configuration change if anything broke. We could also audit Envoy configurations against HAProxy’s to verify the correctness of our Synapse configuration generator. Over a period of two months, we deployed Envoy to individual services and then flipped service configurations to send downstream requests through Envoy instead of HAProxy, monitoring and ensuring no behavioral or performance regressions along the way. Migration hasn’t been totally without bumps and bruises, primarily around our custom Synapse and Envoy integrations and management of static Envoy configurations. Envoy’s network connection handling, especially across hot restarts, differed enough from HAProxy to cause unexpected errors in our application connection management code as well. None of these issues have been show-stopping, and as a result production traffic has been smoothly running through Envoy for nearly four months. Performance-wise, Envoy has had no measurable impact on our service latencies compared to HAProxy. HAProxy is still running as a sidecar to facilitate quick emergency rollbacks during the holiday season while engineering resources are a bit thin, so we haven’t yet been able to measure resource utilization impact on our hosts. Envoy has also provided more observability at the network layer for us, especially after we enabled the Thrift filter on a few internal services. Thanks to the filter instrumentation, Envoy has started to provide request and response metrics that we didn’t have access to before without any application code changes. These small but impactful improvements and the overall operational stability have given us the confidence to continue pursuing our larger service-mesh roadmap for 2019, with Envoy as the engine to power it. What Comes Next? With Envoy rolled out at the proxy level and managing L4 traffic, we’ll spend the first part of 2019 solidifying operational tooling in order to start really leveraging Envoy’s control capabilities. We plan to deploy an implementation of Envoy’s discovery service API backed by a centralized configuration store to bring dynamic configuration to our Envoy deployment and provide an interface for developers to manage those configurations on a per-service basis. We’re also starting to leverage Kubernetes more for internal services, so building out that part of our Envoy deployment will be seeing much more development starting early next year. A primary area of interest there is in using Envoy’s route management tooling to facilitate service migrations into Kubernetes. Finally, while Envoy is currently used for most of our backend service communication, we still leverage AWS ELBs for some external ingress points and also use HAProxy as the main external load-balancing and routing layer for the core Reddit backend application. Running Envoy at the edge will provide substantially more observability and service routing control. We’re hoping that being able to do complex request-management operations such as shadowing inbound traffic and traffic-shifting at the edge will pay dividends as we continue splitting the monolith into smaller, more-manageable services. Rolling Envoy out to production has been a massive undertaking this year for Reddit and couldn’t have been done without a ton of internal and external support. We’d like to thank the Envoy community for building and maintaining a tremendous piece of software and also Turbine Labs (especially Mark McBride, TR Jordan, and Stephan Zuercher) for building out the foundation for Envoy’s Thrift capabilities.

We’ll dive in to everything from top threads to what’s up with Thanos, as well as a look at what’s on-deck for the year ahead! Before we dig into what happened in 2018, here’s a quick summary of Reddit by-the-numbers, as of November 2018: 153 million posts to Reddit1.2 billion comments (and counting!)27 billion votes Reddit is home to thousands of communities, endless conversation and authentic human connection. Whether you’re into breaking news, sports, TV fan theories or a never-ending stream of the Internet’s cutest animals, there’s a community on Reddit for you. With more than 330 million monthly active users, organized by nearly 150K active communities, and 14 billion views per month, Reddit is a growing family of millions of diverse people sharing the things they care about most. And with thousands of new communities joining the platform in 2018 alone, getting started can be overwhelming. We’re not here to spell out a 101 guide to Reddit or share tips & tricks (though, we’ve got those too!). Instead, we’re aiming to share top and trending content from across the site in 2018. So, without further ado… Across the site, we saw a surge in activity in 2018, growing 22% YoY in engagement (posts + comments + votes) and 30% YoY in views. But perhaps more important than time-spent and user-growth on site is what actually happened on Reddit in 2018? To kick things off, we dug into most upvoted posts of the year. Of note, 2 of Reddit’s most-viewed videos also appear in our top 5, alongside other videos and image-heavy posts: Most upvoted posts of 2018: 313K upvotes; “This is what happens when one company owns dozens of local news stations” via r/videos285K upvotes; “Heat index was 110 degrees so we offered him a cold drink. He went for a full body soak instead” via r/aww (Note: 2nd most viewed video on Reddit in 2018)277K upvotes; “VOTE UPWARDS IF YOU’RE STILL UNBANNED TO FLEX ON SNAPPENED USERS” via r/thanosdidnothingwrong246K upvotes; “Local Mexican restaurant used to be a Chinese restaurant. Instead of painting over a mural, they just put sombreros on the pandas.” via r/mildlyinteresting245K upvotes; “Reddit, Thanos has a message for you…” via r/thanosdidnothingwrong (Note: Most viewed video on Reddit in 2018) And yet, when we dug into the most-upvoted comments on Reddit in 2018, we saw a shift in engagement. Enter r/AskReddit, AKA “the place to ask and answer thought-provoking questions.” It’s this community where we see commenters being more engaged and active vs. posting, as redditors entertain conversations on everything from biggest regrets to parenting surprises and general advice. Top upvoted comments by post in 2018: 84K upvotes; “Your ‘guy friend’ would %&*^ you if given the chance. That’s why your SO hates him.” via r/AskReddit81K upvotes; “Sex it is.” via r/AskReddit79K upvotes; “I’ve posted this story before but this seems like another appropriate thread for this story. One night during high school, my friend and I got invited to a party. I didn’t drive back then so my friend picked me up…” via r/AskReddit74K upvotes; “When I was in kindergarten if you did stuff well and didn’t get In trouble you earned points that you could buy a reward with. I saved mine up for a long time to get a mini gumball machine, but when I finally went to the get it I made a split second decision…” via r/AskReddit74K upvotes; “President.” via r/AskReddit Reddit encountered a lot of “firsts” in 2018, including the launch of our redesign––the first overhaul of the site in more than a decade, new mod tools (like ModMail search) and night mode. As with any new chapter, our community evolved and changed as well. Here’s a look at what’s new on Reddit for 2018, starting with the largest new communities. Largest new communities by subscribers in 2018: ThanosDidNothingWrong with 568K subscribersInTheSoulStone with 257K subscribersAbsoluteUnits with 229K subscribersKeanuBeingAwesome with 164K subscribersPovertyFinance with 131K subscribers We also saw redditors start to build a community, or following, of their own. From notorious Twitch streamer u/thesquatingdog and u/NASA to u/GovSchwarzenegger and u/RealWWE, we’re seeing a shift for some users to leverage the Reddit platform and its highly-engaged communities for more than interest-based conversation, but also brand-building around their areas of expertise. Home to thousands of communities and endless conversation online, Reddit is the go-to place for hundreds of million of people to debate and discuss everything from relationship advice and product reviews to favorite movies and sportings events, there’s literally something for everyone. Most comments per post in 2018: 84K comments; “[#5][XBOX] Anything-Goes Trading Thread” via r/RocketLeagueExchange84K comments; “REMINDER- COMMENT OR POST ON THE SUB SO THE BOT KNOWS YOU ARE ACTIVE” via r/thanosdidnothingwrong77K comments; “Official Discussion – Avengers: Infinity War [SPOILERS]” via r/movies76K comments; “Game Thread: Jacksonville Jaguars (12-6) at New England Patriots (14-3)” via r/NFL66K comments; “BAN MEGA THREAD” via r/thanosdidnothingwrong When looking at the most comments per post in 2018, fan-favorite “The Snappening” (i.e. r/ThanosDidNothingWrong) made an appearance 4 times in the top 10. This should come as no surprise if you’re in-the-loop on the community-led activation. But for those who are r/OutOfTheLoop, here’s a quick TL;DR: Inspired by Avengers: Infinity War, a group of redditors banded together to see if they could ban half of r/ThanosDidNothingWrong. [WARNING: Spoilers ahead.] This wasn’t too strange of an idea, given that the good guy in the movie to which this subreddit was dedicated to was similarly trying to save the universe by freeing up half its precious resources. As the subreddit began to approach 100K subscribers, more and more users began to rally behind the idea, eventually convincing the mods and site admins to get on board. Soon, media started to catch on and the subreddit was consistently hitting the top spot on r/all causing the community to grow to more than 500K subscribers. Naturally, we saw an epic number of memes begin to surface. The draw became so great even the Russo brothers (directors of the film) and Josh Brolin (Thanos) joined in the fun. A few days later, the community peaked at 700K subscribers right as the ban began. For the next couple of days, a series of other events unfolded, including the rise of new communities, trophies and more. Check out the full recap here. In addition to super meta on-site activations, breaking news and game launches that drive tons of conversation, Reddit saw tons of engagement around the ever-notorious “AMA.” Perhaps one of the Internet’s most prolific phrases, AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything.” Did you know it started on Reddit? Now, the term is used more broadly to describe an interview occuring between the host user and all the others who participate and ask questions. So far in 2018, we’ve hosted upwards of 1.8K AMAs on Reddit, with a range of hosts and topics, from celebrities and politicians to firefighters, the FCC Commissioner and the astronauts at NASA. Below is a quick at-a-glance of top AMAs on Reddit in 2018 by upvotes and comments. You’ll notice, no matter which way we slice the data, Bill Gates reigns supreme… Top AMAs by upvotes in 2018: 124K upvotes; “I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ask Me Anything.” via r/IAmA85K upvotes; “We are firefighters and net neutrality experts. Verizon was caught throttling the Santa Clara Fire Department’s unlimited Internet connection during one of California’s biggest wildfires. We’re here to answer your questions about it, or net neutrality in general, so ask us anything!” via r/IAmA84K upvotes; “I’m the candidate who was thrown out of the West Virginia House for reading off fossil fuel donors! But there’s more to me than that. I’m Lissa Lucas, AMA! [xpost /r/Political_Revolution]” via r/IAmA79K upvotes; “Hi, I’m Stacey Abrams. If I win my “toss up” Georgia gubernatorial race, I’ll be the first Black woman governor in America. Ask Me Anything!” via r/politics72K upvotes; “IamA FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel who voted for Net Neutrality, AMA!” via r/IAmA Most comments by AMA post in 2018: 22K comments; “I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ask Me Anything.” via r/IAmA19K comments; “I am Dr. Jordan B Peterson, U of T Professor, clinical psychologist, author of 12 Rules for Life and Maps of Meaning, and creator of The Self Authoring Suite. Ask me anything!” via r/IAmA12.5K comments; “I’m a Catholic Bishop and Philosopher Who Loves Dialoguing with Atheists and Agnostics Online. AMA!” via r/IAmA10.5K comments; “I am receiving Universal Basic Income payments as part of a pilot project being tested in Ontario, Canada. AMA!” via r/IAmA10K comments; “I’m Sid Fischer, a student who was in the third room shot into by a murderer in the recent school shooting, AMA” via r/IAmA Unlike other platforms, redditors engage in long-form, authentic conversation. Much like other platforms, those conversations can be controversial. That said, when we looked into this type of content, what we found wasn’t necessarily negative and sometimes just plain fun. For example, take a look at the top 2 most downvoted posts of 2018: 48.5K downvotes; “You can only downvote this picture of squidward if you Upvote the picture of spongebob that I will link in the comments.” via r/BikiniBottomTwitter31K downvotes; “A picture of Thanos should be the most downvoted post of all time.” via r/thanosdidnothingwrong And when we take a look at what we consider to be the most controversial posts––i.e. posts by vote ratio*, but closest to zero ratio––to better understand the split vote ratio between up/down we see a mix of culturally-relevant AMAs, interesting images and ongoing discussions around gaming and more. *Minimum 5K votes MarginUpvotesDownvotesLinksubreddit1.01%7,7767,621I’m an investigative reporter who uncovered evidence that the government is forcibly drugging migrant children at the border.

New rule: No more bitching about historical accuracy, it’s a game, not a history book. Violatons will have consequences.Battlefield We also dug into the most downvoted comments of 2018, only to find that, r/ThanosDidNothingWrong, of course, dominated the top 10 with 5 total posts. A few other notable ones included a case of mistaken identity with r/Roll20 and one user suggesting that a redditor test out an abandoned electric chair in r/WTF. About a year after launching native video hosting, it’s now the dominant way people are viewing and posting video content. In the 2 months since we released our “Video on Reddit” report, we’ve seen a 40% jump in video consumption, from 1 billion native video views per month to 1.4 billion. We also reported Reddit was serving more than 400K hours of natively hosted video every day and more than 13 million hours of video monthly, a growth of 38% since the beginning of 2018. Not only is native video proving to be a growing medium for Content Creators on Reddit, the content also aligns with our audience and communities––which is crucial to the success of Reddit-hosted video and the authentic conversations surrounding them. With engagement on Reddit being self-selected and community-based, video performance in each community varies by cultures and communication styles. For example, with 50% of our audience under the age of 34, “snack sized” videos––AKA short, quick-consumption clips––are a trademark of their content consumption patterns. Video and GIFs represent a major proportion of the content shared on Reddit. With the launch of our native video hosting and player in August 2017, we’ve seen rich content and conversation continue to coexist within communities in a way that is authentic to Reddit and its thousands of communities. It’s no surprise that redditors are news-obsessed. In fact, a recent Pew Research Center study shows that users on Reddit are more news-focused (73%) than any other platform. In 2018, Reddit partnered with Local Media Consortium in an effort to empower LMC’s 75 local media company members – which represent more than 1,700 newspaper, broadcast, and digital titles –– to reach new audiences and engage more deeply with their existing communities. Below are a few highlights from news and media-related engagements on Reddit in 2018: Live Threads provide real-time information about a live event that multiple contributors can update with new details. Anyone viewing can see live updates immediately without having to refresh the page or feed––and unlike comment-based threads, there is no limit to the number of updates during the course of a live thread event. Redditors have come to rely on this feature to track breaking news, live events and natural disasters. In 2018, one live thread in particular stands out for its engagement: r/LiveCounting’s live thread as the community approached 10 million. At peak, we saw nearly 146K concurrent viewers. Megathreads are a great way to streamline a conversation, rallying redditors around a single thread versus multiple posts with similar discussions. Typically, we see Mods create and “sticky” megathreads at the top of their respective communities for relevant events, launches, holidays and important breaking news. This year’s top megathread was around suicide prevention following the news of Anthony Bourdain’s passing. Here’s a look at some of 2018’s top megathread-worthy moments… Top Megathreads by upvotes in 2018: 128K upvotes; “Suicide Prevention Megathread” via r/AskReddit74K upvotes; “Stephen Hawking megathread” via r/AskScience71K upvotes; “BAN MEGA THREAD” via r/ThanosDidNothingWrong66K upvotes; “Megathread: Office of Special Counsel Indicts 13 Russian Nationals and 3 Russian Entities for Interference in 2016 Election” via r/Politics65K upvotes; “Megathread: F.B.I. Raids Office of Trump’s Longtime Lawyer Michael Cohen” via r/Politics Engagement with media and publishers: Redditors also find a lot of value in interacting directly with media and journalists on-site. In 2018, we saw a range of great content stemming from publishers such as NatGeo (World Photo Day and an AMA on elephants) to The Washington Post’s powerful AMA on the death of Jamal Khashoggi hosted by two colleagues who worked with the journalist. Publishers also found creative ways to engage with redditors in 2018, including a variety of engagement prompts that got users talking with them directly and sharing feedback to help build storylines. A few key media engagement moments throughout the last year include USA Today’s r/politics prompt around Election Day and Bleacher Report’s hilarious, organic comments in response to posts across the platform. In fact, some redditors were so delighted by these transparent efforts to connect with readers that they sent Dallas Morning News 41 pizzas as a random act of kindness. After looking at trends, both on- and off-Reddit in 2018, we wanted to see what predictions we could make for the year ahead. From trending topics and conversations on-site, to the latest and greatest in specific interest categories, here’s a quick look at what we found… Entertainment is huge on Reddit, with redditors being among the most passionate television fans on the Internet. Each year, redditors have made r/GameofThrones a popular destination to discuss current episodes of the show. With no new season airing in 2018, we saw the community lose its title as the No. 1 most popular television subreddit for the first time since 2011. However, with the final season airing next year, we predict engagement to outpace that of years’ past in 2019. In the upcoming 2019 season, it’s likely that Game of Thrones will eclipse 2M monthly comments on Reddit, but in its place we saw fans of entertainment discussing the following top shows across the site: 8.8M uniques on r/RuPaulsDragRace7.7M uniques on r/GameofThrones5.9M uniques on r/RickAndMorty5.7M uniques to r/Westworld4.3M uniques on r/StrangerThings4.2M uniques on r/SouthPark4.0M uniques to r/BoJackHorseman2.3M uniques on r/TheBachelor Skin care is a growing topic of interest for redditors. In fact, in 2018, we saw an acceleration of skincare trend on-site, eclipsing makeup and beauty content for the first time. By April, redditors were posting an average of 20k comments per month relating to skincare, an 81% lift of the 2017 average. A few other trends we saw across top verticals: In fashion, we saw a rise in “Bootcut Bandits,” a term to describe people wearing relaxed straight pants over a fresh pair of high tops or sneaker. Over the year, posts referencing the term tripled, peaking in August 2018In gaming, we saw a rise in key games, such as blockbuster hit “RDR2” for Red Dead Redemption 2, “ENCE” for a relatively new Counter Strike eSports team and even a meme from Twitch that became an integral part of gaming lingo and Reddit’s own Snappening: ༼ つ ◕_ ◕ ༽つ .In sports, we saw a rise in… copypasta––a block of text copied and pasted so many times across the internet that it’s become a meme––with redditors in sports subreddits posting copypasta comments 30% more frequently than 2017. Users in r/NBA and r/NFL showed a particular affinity for the format, with each subreddit more than doubling their copypasta usage over the year. Best of Reddit 2018 As communities across Reddit close our 2018 with their very own “Best of Reddit” rankings, we encourage you to check out r/bestof2018 to keep tabs on how the community has voted. Best of will take place over the course of December and January in various communities, where redditors can nominate and vote on their top posts, threads, users and more. We’ll be sure to update you on Best of Reddit 2018 outcomes in 2019. Until then, from all of us at Reddit HQ, Happy Snoo Year!"},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/the-eu-copyright-directive-what-redditors-in-europe-need-to-know","date":"2018-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"The EU Copyright Directive","text":"Defending equal access to the free and open internet is core to Reddit’s ideals, and something that redditors have told us time and again they hold dear too, from the SOPA/PIPA battle to the fight for Net Neutrality. This is why even though we are an American company with a user base primarily in the United States, we’ve nevertheless spent a lot of time this year warning about how an overbroad EU Copyright Directive could restrict Europeans’ equal access to the open Internet—and to Reddit. Despite these warnings, it seems that EU lawmakers still don’t fully appreciate the law’s potential impact, especially on small and medium-sized companies like Reddit. So we’re stepping things up to draw attention to the problem. Users in the EU will notice that when they access Reddit via desktop, they are greeted by a modal informing them about the Copyright Directive and referring them to detailed resources on proposed fixes. The problem with the Directive lies in Articles 11 (link licensing fees) and 13 (copyright filter requirements), which set sweeping, vague requirements that create enormous liability for platforms like ours. These requirements eliminate the previous safe harbors that allowed us the leeway to give users the benefit of the doubt when they shared content. But under the new Directive, activity that is core to Reddit, like sharing links to news articles, or the use of existing content for creative new purposes (r/photoshopbattles, anyone?) would suddenly become questionable under the law, and it is not clear right now that there are feasible mitigating actions that we could take while preserving core site functionality. Even worse, smaller but similar attempts in various countries in Europe in the past have shown that such efforts have actually harmed publishers and creators. Accordingly, we hope that today’s action will drive the point home that there are grave problems with Articles 11 and 13, and that the current trilogue negotiations will choose to remove both entirely. Barring that, however, we have a number of suggestions for ways to improve both proposals. Engine and the Copia Institute have compiled them here at https://dontwreckthe.net/. We hope you will read them and consider calling your Member of European Parliament (look yours up here). We also hope that EU lawmakers will listen to those who use and understand the internet the most, and reconsider these problematic articles. Protecting rights holders need not come at the cost of silencing European internet users. Don’t let the EU Copyright Directive silence European redditors."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/holiday-on-reddit","date":"2018-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Reddit for Business"],"title":"Holiday on Reddit","text":"The holidays are right around the corner, so what better time to explore the power of Reddit’s communities and conversation? With more than 330M monthly unique visitors and 18+ billion views per month, it’s no surprise that the Internet is turning to redditors when it comes to purchase advice in advance of holiday shopping. Redditors are seen as product experts From the thoughtful responses to everyday life questions in r/AskReddit to recommendations on products and more in specific interest-based communities, redditors are seen as experts around the web. In fact, redditors log more than 16 minutes per session on average and their highly engaged, thoughtful discussion and recommendations has captured the attention of those off-platform as well. Don’t take our word for it, though.

These enthusiasts flock to Reddit during the weeks surrounding the Super Bowl to discuss everything from game predictions to favorite recipes and more.

With a thread for every game throughout the season, NFL communities see an 86% increase in engagements on game days (for a deeper look into these communities, see our full football insights report here.) During last year’s Super Bowl, game threads in r/eagles, r/patriots, and r/nfl served as a central hub for live conversation. The Super Bowl comes alive on Reddit During the 2018 Super Bowl, engagement on Reddit was massive, growing 90% year-over-year. Super Bowl communities drove 84M+ engagements (posts, comments, votes and views) in the weeks surrounding the big game. Additionally, compared with season average, r/nfl saw a 4x increase in screen views while r/eagles and r/patriots saw a 9.6x increase. These communities acted as a second screen for Redditors where they discussed the game in real time. The Eagles game-clinching stop was the biggest game moment with over 65K engagements during the final minute.

The integration aims to help creators start and build their communities on Reddit, turn Reddit users into fans and provide another way for fans to support the creators they love. Connecting Reddit and Patreon Patreon creators will now have the opportunity to create new and link existing communities on Reddit directly from their Patreon page. Once connected, Reddit creator communities will display Patreon widgets to drive new patrons from Reddit, and Creators can reward their patrons with special Reddit flair to distinguish patronage. Patreon creators on Reddit will also receive flair to distinguish their comments and content throughout their communities. On Patreon, linked creator pages will display Reddit community widgets driving patrons directly to the creator’s Reddit community where fans can engage with the creator, the content and the larger fanbase. To start, we’re testing the integration with select Patreon creators and plan to extend the feature to more creators and communities at the end of October. The value for Creators and Fans The reward system is inherent to the Reddit experience –– upvotes and downvotes have been part of our system of community moderation since the earliest days — and with the Patreon integration, we’re excited to foster the growth and health of fan communities through a new suite of recognition and rewards. By connecting to Reddit, Patreon creators can build their business, grow their fan base and publicly recognize their patrons and supporters. The integration also makes it easier for fans to find and engage with creators they love and get recognition for their support through special patron flair. Finding your home, and audience, online Reddit’s mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. And as home to more than 330M monthly users, 138k+ active communities, thousands of dedicated creators, millions of pieces of original content and some of the most passionate fans on the internet –– it’s up to us to build tools that help our users connect and find their homes online. Creators with communities big and small have found and built their home on Reddit — from podcasters and writers to chefs and watercolorists. Oliver Babish joined Reddit in late 2014 and quickly gained notoriety for his step-by-step cooking videos and engagement with users who recreate his recipes. Over the course of about 4 years, he built up a community of more than 31k subscribers who visit regularly to share their own cooking videos, ask for feedback and engage around new cooking videos that Oliver posts. Similarly, u/shittywatercolor grew his Reddit community to more than 10k fans by sharing his shitty watercolours throughout the Reddit ecosystem (and even within the walls of RedditHQ) to Christine McConnel who got her start on Reddit and now has a show on Netflix –– and we can’t wait to see how the Reddit community evolves and grows with the Patreon integration.

It’s our favorite time of year where we stay up all night playing games to help support one of our favorite charity events, Extra Life! What’s Extra Life, you ask? Thanks to Daylight Savings, it’s a 25-hour gaming marathon where we channel our inner insomniacs and play games all day and night to help raise money for the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. How does it work? Extra Life is similar to any other marathon, except you get to stay indoors and play video games just like you would any other weekend. Unlike traditional marathons, no physical exertion is required (unless you count snack and bathroom breaks as exercise, and we do). As a participant you’ll create a fundraising page on Extra-Life.org, join Team Reddit or a subreddit team of your choice, then ask your friends and family to donate via your fundraising page. On November 3rd, join the horde of other gamers and fire up your gaming rig––or console, or board games––for 25 hours of non-stop gaming. You even get to choose which hospital will benefit from the funds you raise, which means you can pick one close to your home! We’ll have some prizes for the top fundraisers in our Super Team (including all subreddit teams), and there’s also some spiffy content to unlock on the Extra Life site for hitting certain donation milestones. I’m so in! How do I join? You can join Team Reddit by visiting our Super Team page and choosing a subreddit team from your favorite participating community, or by joining the more general Team Reddit. When signing up, you also get to choose which network hospital will receive any funds you raise, so you can pick somewhere close to home. Once you have joined a team be sure to spread the word! One of the most effective ways to raise cash for kids is to reach out to friends and family and encourage them to donate. Send them a link to your fundraising page, and be sure to spread the word across your social networks as well. If you need more advice swing over to r/ExtraLife to find people to play with during the event and discuss fundraising strategies. My favorite subreddit doesn’t have a team. What do? If you build it, they will come. If you’re a mod of a subreddit, create a sub-team as a part of the Super Team Reddit! If you’re not, talk to the mods of your favorite subreddit about creating one! Mods: please see this post for more details about creating a sub-team. Get ready for Game Day: November 3rd Get your game face on! Game day is November 3rd and we’ll be streaming live on our twitch channel from Reddit HQ for the full 25 hours. We’ll be playing all the hits such as LeagueOfLegends, Fortnite, Mario Kart, and many many others. If you’re lucky, you might even get a chance to play some video games against a Reddit admin or two. There will also be a ton of subreddits running their own fundraising efforts, so be sure to check your favorite gaming subreddit to see if they are participating. Dude, I can’t play for 24 hours straight! We know you’re busy and can’t dedicate an entire weekend to playing games, but don’t let that stop you from contributing! It’s totally fine to play at your own pace, or even split your fundraising efforts across multiple days. Extra Life is open to fundraising year-round, November 3rd is just the big day where the majority of people will be playing. I won’t be able to play games at all, can I still help? Absolutely! Visit our Super Team Page and pick someone to support. Even just giving $5 can go a long way to helping the cause. It all adds up! What does Reddit have planned? We’ll be live on our Twitch stream for 25 hours on November 3rd, with Reddit admins facing off in your favorite games.

In fact, we typically see an average of 200M monthly engagements on political content on Reddit, nearly a 10% growth since start of 2018. Here’s a quick breakdown of monthly engagements around political content, on average: 200M+ monthly Engagements on political content:6M comments310K submissions173M upvotes28M downvotes1M new subscriptions From discussing candidates to discovering different perspectives to political debates, AMAs and more, redditors drive more than 140M+ monthly views and 20M+ monthly unique users in top politics communities.

As home to a multiplicity of interesting communities and trends, Reddit is prime space for infinite possibilities. There’s another group of people who count on Reddit, literally. And they’ve been steadfastly counting for several years. Starting with the loneliest number 1. Today, they’re closing in on a whopping 10,000,000 (insert Dr. Evil gif here). How r/LiveCounting got their start It all started years ago when a few redditors over in r/counting tried to count to infinity. It turned out, however, that Reddit’s infrastructure wasn’t built for such incremental activities and some concessions needed to be made. While to this day people over in r/counting continue their march by splitting off into new threads once they reach around 1,000 comments, another segment of counters discovered they could count much faster, and higher than ever before using Reddit live threads. And thus, live counting was born. Q&A with the Live Counting crew This calculating crew isn’t just into counting incrementally, because obviously more variety is exponentially more fun. There is counting in even numbers, odd numbers, prime numbers, hexadecimal, binary, Roman numerals, and even counting with money and with time. When we first encountered this odd community of redditors, we had innumerable questions but few answers. Our acute senses told us this community could function at unparalleled levels, but we needed proof they were humans and not digital beings. What factors go into a good counting session? Is there a formula? Is their whole pursuit irrational or are the numbers they count significant digits? Do all of these counters share some standard deviation from the rest of us? And most of all, does their counting know no limits? To dig deeper into this world of counting, we caught up with a few of the most dedicated live counting contributors to get their take… How did you come to find live counting and start contributing? u/amazingpikachu_38: I got involved after I saw /u/qwertylool live counting and when I saw that, I decided I wanted to try live counting, so I created this account and asked to be approved, I got approved a day or two later, and noticed I got approved on September 28th 2016, when I added my first count, and I have been counting ever since. u/TOP_20: I happened upon /r/counting via a r/askreddit mention of the sub – at that time there was no way to really communicate there so I spent days trying to figure out why – why they counted day in and day out – for weeks and months on end. But like, what the heck is the point of live counting, or is there a point? u/LeinadSpoon: People like feeling like they’re making progress on something, and with counting the numbers just keep going up. It’s similar to the game Cookie Clicker which was popular a few years ago, but with counting you get to cooperate with other people, so it’s sort of like an MMO Cookie Clicker. u/rideride: The premise of the main thread is simple: increment the count by one, and no posting twice in a row. Side threads have also been created, such as Letter Counting and Binary Counting, but the “you cannot post twice in a row” is a universal rule. After Reddit Live was announced, /u/ralgrado created Live Counting. What’s been one of your most memorable experiences as a part of the live counting community? u/TOP_20: I would have a hard time picking my top 50!!!!! Thing is so many times there I have laughed until my tummy hurt. The counting itself is really just a byproduct of our group. It’s everything else that makes our group so addictive (for many) and fun…. the personal goals, the group goals, all the fun activities we come up with like the Prediction contests, quote quizzes and so on. u/dominodan123: It’s probably nostalgia speaking, if I’m allowed to have that after only two years, but my favorite memory from LC was probably the feeling I got a few weeks after the revival when I was starting to realize that this was something that was actually going to stick around. We went from doing 1-3 ks per day (1000 counts per k) to all of a sudden 6+ k per day consistently. Our first stats were being created and our community was birthed. It was really exciting at the time to be part of something like this with the small niche group I was quickly becoming great friends with. u/amazingpikachu_38: One of my many memorable experiences in live counting was when I hit 1,000,000 counts in mid February 2018, just a few days more than 500 days after I joined. The Live Counting community has their own vernacular like GETS and Assists. What do these mean to the casual observer? u/LeinadSpoon: We have a ton of terminology, including acronyms like whtma (“We have too many acronyms”). We have a few terms to refer to certain numbers:get – a number that ends in 000. Gets are automatically captured by a bot and listed on the sidebar for a time. At LC, we celebrate gets a lot less than at /r/counting because we have so many of them, but we do still track them and it’s especially nice for new people to see their name on the sidebar after doing their first run.assist – The number right before the get, ending in 999. Some counters, like /u/amazingpikachu_38, like assists more than gets. He has over 3,000 assists, which I’m pretty sure is the most anyone has of any special number we track.drome – Short for “palindrome”. These are numbers that are the same forwards and backwards, like 9,012,109. Currently, there is one drome every thousand counts, but once we hit 10M they’ll only be once every 10k, so these last few common ones are in higher demand than usual. The live counting thread has a lot of automation behind it. Things like the “Hall of Counters” in the sidebar, and a bot that strikes out counts that aren’t in numerical order. Who created these integrations and how do they work? u/rideride: Perhaps the greatest robots in Live Counting history were created by /u/rschaosid. His most useful bot is /u/count_better, which automatically strikes invalid counts. He also created /u/live_mentions, which sends a message to people if they are mentioned in the thread. There are tons of people who have created and updated stats, including /u/co3_carbonate, /u/piyushsharma301, /u/howtoaddict, /u/IvanLudvig, /u/LeinadSpoon, and /u/artbn. JSONs of every single count are available, allowing statistics to be created through python, Java, etc. Aside from stats, we also have two extensions. “Live Counting Extension,” or LCE, was created by /u/co3_carbonateand is one of the greatest parts of Live Counting. All of our active members have Live Counting Extension. LCE provides behind-the-scenes features to make Live Counting faster, but also includes custom username colors. I currently run LCE. We also make special usernames for whoever counts the most in an 100k range. In May 2017, I created the “Reply Times Extension,” an extension that adds reply times to counts, as well as colors them in 100ms intervals to quickly see how fast the count was. I also let active members get a special reply time number. If users get their own reply time, they get a rainbow username! This extension taught me all that I know about javascript. I had little to no programming experience before making the extension, but now it’s a hobby. Is there an endgame? What are your hopes for the future of live counting? u/rideride: Collectively, however, I don’t see an end to counting. For the future, I hope that we get more active contributors, as our community has gotten to know each other pretty well. Ideally, there would be enough people to always have someone to talk to, but small enough where we’d all know each other pretty well. u/LeinadSpoon: We’ll stop the moment we get to infinity. One of the cool things about live counting is that the journey is more important than the destination. Big milestones like 10M are cool, and I imagine the pace we’ve had these past couple of months will slow off a bit once we get there, but once we’ve gotten to 10M we’ll turn our focus to other goals. dominodan123: My hopes for our future is really just that we continue to exist as an active community, because I truly to love it. It’s always great when we get new members because their excitement to rank up in the stats and learn about our community is infectious. Thank you, r/LiveCounting, for keeping things interesting. By the way, for those of you who love puns and math, the first person to tally up the number of puns in this post and reply in r/blog with the correct count will be on the receiving end of some Reddit Premium!"},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/video-on-reddit","date":"2018-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Reddit for Business"],"title":"Video on Reddit","text":"Christine Cassis(u/thunderemoji) It’s been about a year since we started hosting native video on Reddit, and in that time the format has helped evolve conversations, content and community. Redditors are now posting and watching more video than we ever expected, and to understand the impact of video on Reddit, we turned to our data team for an in-depth analysis of viewing, posting and engagement stats.Native Video is changing Reddit Multimedia content, including video and GIFs, represents a major proportion of the content shared on Reddit; but about a year after launching native video hosting, it’s now the dominant way people are viewing and posting video content. We’re already averaging more than 1 billion native video views per month, and since launching hosted videos, nearly a quarter of all videos posted to Reddit use our native player (now surpassing YouTube video links on-site). We’re now serving 400k hours of natively hosted video every day and more than 13 million hours of video monthly, a growth of 38% since the beginning of 2018. Top viewed video on Reddit, with 2.2M views. We also took a look at video performance across platforms and found that mobile and the redesign are driving native video adoption and views. Since the beginning of 2018, Reddit video views on mobile have doubled — and as of August 2018, almost 70% of video consumption on Reddit occurs from our mobile apps.The redesign has also been a significant driver for adoption for both video creators and consumers: The redesign has shown a 50% increase in video posts over old Reddit. A growing medium for Content Creators Native video is also proving to be a growing medium for Content Creators on Reddit. In August 2018 alone, redditors posted almost 1M videos to the site, a 31% increase from August 2017. Redditors are increasingly adopting the native video format. With more than 400K hours of natively hosted video published to Reddit every day, and more than 13 million hours of video monthly, we’ve seen a growth rate of 38% since the start of 2018. Since launching hosted videos, almost a quarter of those videos posted to Reddit use our native player, surpassing YouTube links. Mobile apps drive adoption and views Video growth is largely driven by mobile apps. As of last month, nearly 70% of all video consumption on Reddit occurs on our Android and iOS apps and in the last year, video consumption on mobile has doubled. Video advertising on Reddit We want our partners to make video a bigger part of their experience on Reddit, which is why we’ve invested in making video a more meaningful part of our advertisers’ experience on Reddit. With improved targeting, guaranteed views and more surrounding engagements, the results speak for themselves: Advertisers are seeing significant improvements in conversion, 2.3x, over non-video ads. Some campaigns have shown engagement jump 3-5x higher than a static post and view rates are in line with platforms like Facebook. Further, Reddit’s beta video advertisers are seeing significant increases in key metrics such as brand favorability and purchase intent when compared with non-video ads. In fact, a recent study by Milward Brown indicates that Reddit Video is performing considerably better than industry averages for digital video advertising. “We’ve been partnering with Reddit over the past two years measuring campaign performance, and during that time Reddit’s average performance has outperformed our benchmarks for both awareness and lower-funnel metrics. From these initial campaign results their new video product is on the same track, and advertisers should take notice.” – James Jarzab, Vice President at Kantar, Insights division. For examples of video ad campaigns, check out our partners: Audi, Nintendo, Olympic channel, Hotel Artemis and Netflix. Video and the community Last but not least, our native video content aligns with our audience and communities, which is crucial for the success of video and authentic conversations on Reddit. With engagement on Reddit being self-selected and community-based, videos that perform well in each community varies by cultures and communication styles. For example, with 50% of our audience is under the age of 34, “snack sized” videos––AKA short and quick-consumption clips––are a trademark of how they share and communicate. 2nd-most viewed video on Reddit, with 1.8M views.Where content and conversation coexist Video and GIFs represent a major proportion of the content shared on Reddit and there’s never been a video comment system as strong as Reddit’s. With the launch of our native video hosting and player in August 2017, we’ve seen rich content and conversation continue to coexist within communities in a way that is authentic to Reddit and its thousands of communities.

From tons of Reddit posts crediting the toaster after each GSW win, tweets from the likes of NBAonTNT and Sports Illustrated, all the way to Klay telling sideline reporters that the “toaster has been working.” Icing on the cake? u/RDollaz got invited by Klay Thompson to ride on the bus during the Warrior’s Championship parade.

Be the conduit for talent for AMAs with sports data-scientists, advertising analysts, league scouts and more.Reddit vs. the Pros: Redditors look to professional commentators, Fantasy Sports speculators and other influencers to determine their predictions and then compare and contact their strategies with others. Let’s find an influencer in the NBA space and have them create weekly predictions then crowdsource those predictions made by redditors.Surround the fan dialog: During the season our sports and basketball communities see a huge spike in traffic due to our users’ inclination to create official game threads (megathreads) for each matchup throughout the season, participate in discussions and talk about any highlights and news.

Are You Registered?","text":"Voting is embedded in the Reddit experience. Yet offline, 1 in 4 eligible US voters isn’t registered. Even the most civically-conscious among us can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed, especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US. For example, did you know that you have to update your voter registration if you move, even if it’s just across town? Or that you also need to update it if you’ve changed your name (say, due to a change in marital status)? Depending on your state, you may even need to re-register if you simply haven’t voted in a while, even if you’ve stayed at the same address. Taken together, these and other factors add up to tens of millions of Americans every election cycle who need to update their registration and might not know it. This is why we are again teaming up with Nonprofit VOTE to celebrate National Voter Registration Day and help spread the word before the midterms this November. You’ll notice a lot of activity around Reddit today in honor of the holiday, including amongst various communities that have decided to participate, including AMAs we have planned, including: A bipartisan tag-team AMA with the Secretaries of State of Washington and Minnesota in r/politics from 10am-12pm ETAn AMA about the weird quirks and history of American voting laws with DoSomething.org’s Head of Campaigns in r/IAmA at 11am ETYou can also see National Voter Registration Day’s AMA with Executive Director Brian Miller: Finally, be sure to take this occasion to make sure that you are registered to vote where you live, or update your registration as necessary.

We may have been over-enthusiastic announcing this to millions of Redditors, but after reviewing thousands of resumes we were able to narrow it down to the seven interns who would make up our first program. A year later, we’re excited to announce that it was a success and we’re doing it again! This time we’re going twice as big and expanding our program to include internships in Software Engineering, Design and Product Management. So why should you apply to become an intern at Reddit? Uh, because it’s an awesome, one-of-a-kind experience at a time when our globally-trafficked website is growing faster than ever before, but don’t take our word for it. Check out what some of this year’s inaugural class of interns had to say about the program: “I was really looking for an internship where I could make a real impact at the company and I think this project was exactly that. Additionally, I really enjoyed the vibe and sense of community here, which made it so easy to engage with and get to know anyone and everyone here at Reddit.” –– Ads intern. The interns with spez. Driving impact Highlights from the internship program include a project focusing on building and releasing a new user-facing feature, mapping out the Snooniverse and creating a tool that’ll make our site less likely to crash, to name a few. Our interns also got the opportunity to make an impact on our community IRL, volunteering with local homeless aid group Simply the Basics. Learnings & advice We asked our interns what they wish they had known from the start and advice for potential 2019 interns. Here’s what they had to say: “I wish I had been less scared to branch out! I wish I had set up more coffee chats and lunches during my time here because everyone is so cool.” –– Creators intern“Don’t be afraid to ask questions, even if you feel like you’ve already asked the question before! It’s important to make sure you ask all the questions you have so that you get the most out of your internship and don’t do work that has already been done or spend time debugging things that someone with more experience than you would have solved right away.” –– Relevance intern“Ask questions! Talk to everyone! Everyone is lovely and willing to engage with you, they’re very happy you’re here! Take the opportunity to meet interesting people and get some advice in return! Learn everything!” –– Ads intern“I wish I had been more comfortable asking for help sooner. I was shy about not wanting to bother people at first. People were very welcoming so it wasn’t a bad environment or anything, I was just shy and it took a few weeks to get over it.” –– Infrastructure intern Join the Galactic Reddit Academy Interested in becoming a part of the second-ever intern class at Reddit?

In particular, we’ll discuss how our move to a Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture: Improved code flexibility, comprehensibility, and maintainability for future growth and faster iteration.Unlocked a buttery-smooth 58% improvement in scroll performance.Encouraged unit testing and increased test count from only a handful to 200+. For clarity, the below is a high level diagram of the layered architecture we ended up with. We’ll be focusing on the view and presenter layer in this first post. High level: The layered architecture we ended up with. Setting the stage Over a year ago we published Building the Feed for the Reddit iOS App. There, we discussed how we built a performant, extensible feed with an admirable 99.95% crash-free session rate. We explained our application of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and creating abstractions for fetching paginated feeds of data. Fast forward to today and Reddit has grown and continues to grow both as an organization and a product. Consequently, the Reddit iOS app was placed under heavier demands. The app needed to support more feature requests, faster development iteration cycles, and a higher quality standard. It also had to support a development team that had grown from around three developers to twenty-plus developers. The original MVC architecture strained under these increased demands and we needed to make architectural changes to adapt. Illustrating the problem The code had also grown more inflexible and incomprehensible. In the iOS development community, “Massive View Controller” is a well-known appropriation of the MVC initialism because it’s common for view controllers to balloon to one-thousand plus line god objects. Despite our best efforts, this problem began to rear its head. On top of this, our view controller inheritance hierarchy had grown uncomfortably deep. This meant our controllers began to grow into incomprehensible god objects that were inflexible to change. The final nail in the MVC coffin that necessitated a re-architecture was when we wanted to change our view layer implementation of the feed. As the Reddit app continued growing, the feed scroll performance started to degrade from a consistent 60 fps to an all too occasional 45-55 fps. This meant we needed to rewrite the view layer of the feed while still supporting the original implementation. But, in the existing MVC architecture, we couldn’t rewrite the view layer of the feed without thousands of lines of code duplication. Further, there existed many difficult to test parts of the codebase. Code was placed into difficult to test view layer classes and dependencies were often singletons or hard-coded into the class itself. We wanted to makes changes that would unlock the assurance that testing provides. On top of all this, these changes needed to maintain the high crash-free session rate, lay the foundation for the next phase of growth, and work without disrupting the feature teams dependent on the existing infrastructure. This meant changes had to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Going Model-View-Presenter We decided we wanted the next iteration of the app needed to address the above problems. While we considered several options, we decided to go with a Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture. In addition to meeting the above criteria, MVP has the benefit of being a well-known and documented architecture which meant it would be easier to educate engineers. It also preserved the concept of “view models.” If necessary, we can create single-responsibility-focused view model objects in the presenter and use them to inflate our views. Model-View-Presenter diagram. Breaking up “Massive View Controller” Commonly in an iOS app, view objects are subclasses of UIView, controller objects are subclasses of UIViewController, and your model objects are plain ol’ objects. As you can read in the name “UIViewController,” the role of both the view and controller are combined into a single object. This means that MVC on iOS tends to lose its proposed benefits because of its tight coupling of the view and controller layer. Interestingly, Apple themselves admit to this coupling. What Model-View-Controller on iOS often ends up actually looking like. In an MVP architecture on iOS, we accept this notion and formalize it by considering the UIViewController to really just be a glorified view layer object. This concept of treating the UIViewController as a view object with an unfortunate naming has gained popularity in recent years. So, in our UIViewControllers, we remove any non-view logic. Then, we allow the presenter to take on the role of the intermediary between the view and model. In this new role, the presenter has no knowledge of view concretions such as UIViewControllers. Note that the presenter communicates with the view through an interface. In theory, we could swap out the view implementation with an NSViewController (MacOS) or other view concretion. What Slimming down the ViewController by introducing a Presenter and splitting up responsibilities. Thinking through MVP As you can see in the MVP diagram above, the architecture actually ends up looking a lot like MVC. The truth of the matter is that there are more similarities than differences. This architecture just helps us restore proper separation of presentation code and business logic that MVC aims for. In fact, descendent MV(x) architectures, such as MVP, MVVM, MVAdapter, etc., are really just different flavors of this core concept. One might wonder further why we threw out MVC altogether. In fact, Apple describes different kinds of controllers such as model controllers, mediating controllers, and coordinating controllers. Truthfully, we likely could replace our presenter with a different kind of controller. However, we chose not to because most iOS developers, for a variety of reasons, are instilled with the belief that UIViewControllers are synonymous with controllers. By using the word “presenter” we signal to the developer that this object is meaningfully different than a typical controller with a specific set of responsibilities and properties. Improved flexibility, maintainability, and comprehensibility “Prefer composition over inheritance” is a well-known mantra in programming. With inheritance, you have to predict the future and construct a grand taxonomy of objects. However, when your “perfectly” constructed inheritance hierarchy begins to fall apart because of unforeseen changes, it’s difficult to change this rigid structure. With composition, you can instead compose your object out of other objects and delegate work to them. This is useful because now you can easily change the behavior of your object at runtime by simply changing the objects it’s composed out of. These composable objects are also more comprehensible because you’ve pushed code out of your inheritance hierarchy into a more single-responsibility focused abstraction. This composability was one of the greatest benefits the MVP architecture gave us. Since our view controllers are now composed of a presenter, we can change the behavior of a view controller by simply changing the concrete presenter it’s composed of. We can also worry less about having to construct and decipher a complex and rigid inheritance structure. Lastly, presenters and view controllers are easier to comprehend because they have a more focused set of responsibilities.By introducing a presenter and pushing non-view logic into it, we were able to flatten our view controller inheritance hierarchy. In the graphic below, you can see that we were able to remove the GalleryFeedViewController class because we pushed all gallery mode logic into a presenter. As discussed before, this flatter inheritance hierarchy is easier to comprehend and less rigid. Flattened inheritance hierarchy through composition. Free to change the view layer implementation As discussed earlier, the feed scroll performance started to degrade from a consistent 60 fps to an all too occasional 45-55 fps. So, we decided to use Texture to rewrite the view layer implementation of the feed. Texture is an open source framework built on top of Apple’s UIKit that improves UI performance by precomputing work on a background thread. But, given the current MVC architecture, we couldn’t actually change out the view layer implementation without a ton of code duplication. Before MVP: Duplicate non-view code (orange) in the ViewControllers. Using the new MVP architecture, we were able to evolve to support Texture rather than have to rewrite things from scratch. We simply pushed all non-view logic into a shared presenter class. Then, we wrote our new Texture implementation of the view layer and reused our presenter code. This gave us the benefit of supporting both view implementations until we were comfortable rolling out the Texture feed to all users. After MVP: Move non-view code into a shared Presenter. So what’s the impact? This chart illustrates how much we improved our feed scroll performance. We want to stay as close as possible to 60 frames per second to achieve a buttery smooth scrolling feed. Unit testing Although MVP isn’t solely responsible for enabling and encouraging unit testing, it was a large factor. Most notably, MVP increases the unit testing surface area by moving code out of the harder to test view layer into the more easily testable presenter layer. Conveniently, this also has the side benefit of making our views dumber. As the views get dumber, we care less about testing them. Increasing the testable center by moving non-view code out of the view layer. Unit tests make our codebase more maintainable because they give us confidence in making changes and helps us understand what the correct behavior should be. They also make our code more flexible and comprehensible because they encourage techniques like dependency injection, composition, and programming to abstractions rather than concretions. Since the MVP refactor, we’ve gone from only a handful of unit tests to 200+. A critical examination of MVP at Reddit Though our MVP refactor work did give us a lot, there are some things to critically examine. Re-writing the feeds using Texture introduced a new set of threading issues. The app was not originally written to support such an asynchronous view implementation. This means we’ve had issues where inconsistency between our view state and our app state introduces bugs. For example, the view of the feed might expect there to be N posts. However, on a background thread the app state has changed under our feet undetected and now contains <N posts. If we don’t correctly address the discrepancy, the app will crash when the view attempts to display the Nth post in the feed. Threading bugs are among the hardest to fix. They’re difficult to consistently reproduce which means they’re hard to debug. We’ve had to change some of the logic for retrieving the data source for our feed views. In particular, we’ve put in safe guards to “freeze” the data source from any changes while the feed view is undergoing any sort of changes. This and other smaller fixes have cut down on the threading related bugs. However, there still remains room for improvement in improving our support for supporting a more async, multithreaded world. Secondly, the presenter layer is yet another “hoop” to jump through. This hoop jumping does have a cost in terms of increased code complexity and decreased performance. Sometimes you might want to just execute non-view logic in a UIViewController out of luxury or habit. In a most unfortunate situation, you might find your presenter merely exists as a pass through where no meaningful logic is actually executed. In a situation like this, the cost of having a presenter doesn’t seem to justify its existence. What MVP really looks like. Sometimes layer bridging from View to RedditCore with or without a Presenter. In reality, the app hasn’t been entirely converted to an MVP architecture. For one, converting every single UIViewController to have a presenter would be a massive undertaking—not evolutionary. Secondly, as stated in the previous paragraph, sometimes presenters just aren’t necessary. As we discovered in the Texture feed refactor work, a presenter is great if you’re trying to slim down your massive view controller or you need to have a variable view implementation or you have sophisticated logic you want to test. But sometimes your UIViewController is so simple that you can’t justify adding a presenter. What this amounts to is that presenters are optional and the developer should implement one only when necessary. Summary and future work Refactoring to an MVP architecture in the Reddit iOS app helped us achieve a lot of our desired goals. By introducing a presenter layer, we were able to gradually evolve the application architecture to support a new view layer implementation without disrupting feature teams. Code is becoming more comprehensible as we slim down our “Massive View Controller”s by pushing non-view logic code into the presenter layer. We’ve also given the feature teams more leverage to quickly iterate and spin up new features. And lastly, we’ve made large strides in improving the testability of the application. Given all that, we still have a long ways to go. We’re still building out our presenters and refining them. We need to continue moving non-view logic out of UIViewControllers and into the presenter layer. We also need to make presenters more single-responsibility-focused. In the end, the application and its architecture is—and always will be—evolving. Up next, we’ll take an even broader look at the architecture of the iOS app. We’ll discuss the modularization of the Reddit iOS app by creating separate frameworks such as RedditCore and RedditUI. And we’ll tie this back to how this works with the MVP architecture.

So what better time to do a quick overview of Football communities on Reddit? From team-specific subreddits to memes, broader discussion, player fan clubs and more, here’s a quick rundown, by-the-numbers: 167.4M average monthly views in the last year226.1M average monthly views for 2017 season7.3M average monthly uniques in last year8.2M average monthly uniques in 2017 season A place for every sports fan Did you know that there are more than 950+ sports communities on Reddit, generating more than 576M+ monthly pageviews? Fans from across the globe come to share highlights, watch matches together and root for their favorite teams. Not only that, but sports fans are amongst Reddit’s most engaged. Across top verticals, we see sports fans being the most engaged, with more than 35M+ monthly engagements (votes, posts and comments) per user compared to our top verticals. Football thrives on Reddit From game highlights, to team-specific threads and breaking news, football never sleeps on Reddit. On game days, we see an increase in engagements in football-related subreddits by 86% compared to off-days. We also see a variety of communities get involved. As the season gets underway, we see these conversations spill over into other communities. For example, we see memes and gifs spill over into r/Funny and rhetorical questions in r/AskReddit. We also see football community subscribers frequent other popular communities, including r/NBA, r/technology, r/WorldNews, r/movies and more. And beyond infiltrating broader interests and topics, football communities are abuzz all season long. Most engaged fans on Reddit So which NFL team takes the cake on Reddit? Although it will come as no surprise that the Patriots, Eagles and Packers have the largest fan bases on the site, their fans are middle of the pack in actual engagement. Based on per-user engagement since the start of the 2017 season, the top five teams based user engagement might be surprising: Los Angeles RamsHouston TexansNew York GiantsTampa Bay Buccaneers (surprisingly, also the smallest fanbase on Reddit)Chicago Bears Not all fan bases engage with Reddit in the same way, though. Voting behavior, especially, can vary quite a bit from team to team. Bengals fans are the most downvote-happy users, downvoting 2.0% more than the median NFL fanbase. Jaguars fans, meanwhile, are the most willing to upvote, doling out 1.6% more upvotes than the median. Competing Fanbases Unsurprisingly, team alliances and rivalries start to emerge when more closely looking at fanbases’ voting trends. Using each comment’s and post’s vote ratio from NFL fans as an “expected vote,” we can determine which teams’ fanbases upvote and downvote each other’s content relative to those expectations. Titans fans, for example, upvote Saints fans 1.4% more than expected, while downvoting Jaguars fans 20% more than expected––and Jags fans return the favor by downvoting Titans fans 14% more than expected. Classic rivalries can be seen here, as well as some budding NFL alliances. Ways to engage Looking for ways to engage the hyperactive football fans of Reddit? Our Brand Strategy team has put together a few ideas: Surround the Fan Dialogue: During the season, our sports and Football communities see a huge spike in traffic due to our users’ inclination to create official game threads (megathreads) for each matchup throughout the season, participate in discussions and talk about any highlights and news. Let’s have your brand surround these conversations via Reddit promoted media.Reddit vs. The Pros: Redditors look to professional commentators, Fantasy Sports speculators, and other sports influencers to determine their predictions, and then compare and contrast their strategies with other users. Let’s find an influencer in the NFL space, have them create weekly predictions, then crowdsource predictions made by Redditors. If Redditors predict more accurate results, we’ll trigger some charitable donation, discount, giveaway, etc.The Gridiron AMA Series: Let’s provide unique perspectives on the sport of Football from a wide variety of verticals.

Skincare on Reddit Skincare alone has generated a ton of interest and great content on Reddit, with more than 9.2M redditors searching for skincare information in the first half of the year.** Their discovery and discussion has generated more than 5M skincare purchases between $50 – $100.** But beyond purchasing power, these communities have demonstrated the potential to change lives. From skincare concerns, like aging and acne, to routine-building, confidence-boosting advice, Redditors around the world are coming together to lift each other up and provide support. Communities like r/SkinCareAddiction are known for their positive engagement. In fact, the community’s first rule is “be kind and respectful” — and it shows. Redditors build trust and support within these communities by offering words of encouragement for “before and after” posts, advising on routines, debating and discussing the science of skincare, and more. Beyond building trust for deeply personalized recommendations on products, routines and more, we see redditors supporting each other. In beauty and skincare communities, we see more positive engagement than average, with 8 upvotes for every downvote and with 33% of unique users coming back 10 or more times in a month, there’s plenty of fresh and engaging user-generated content, daily. Haircare on Reddit Beauty isn’t just make up and skincare, though; it’s haircare, too. Which is why more than 14M redditors have searched for haircare-related content in the past 6 months, with more than 50M redditors making haircare purchases and more than 17M redditors spending between $50 and $200 on haircare products in the last 6 months.** Eager to ask haircare questions, redditors engage in everything from professional AMA’s to haircare science. They also come to places like r/FancyFollicles to show off their hair color and creations, but also to ask for advice on specific looks. Let’s hear it for the boys But it’s not just women contributing to the conversation. Male grooming on Reddit has its own community (r/MaleGrooming) a place for advice, generating more than 210K pageviews each month. Nowhere else on the Internet can you find more interested and relevant, or engaging conversations around male lifestyle topics, including hair care and grooming. In fact, users come in droves to discover and share what they want to wear, trends to stay ahead of the curve, ways to stand out and express themselves. Popular communities include: r/MaleFashionAdvice; 9M+ monthly pageviewsr/MaleGrooming; 208K+ monthly pageviewsr/MaleHairAdvice; 1.6M monthly pageviewsr/MaleLifestyle; 69K monthly pageviewsr/MalePolish; 55K monthly pageviews Not just trend spotters, but trend starters Beauty communities on Reddit don’t just have the power to create popularity and drive purchasing power for products, they’re also trend starters and trend spotters. From best sunscreen for dark skin to winged-liner tricks and hacks for dull tweezers, redditors have got your back. And with more than 28M redditors searching for information on beauty and skincare in the first 6 months of 2018 alone, it’s no wonder why media is starting to take notice.

Working with LMC The partnership is aimed at allowing local media to more proactively connect with people and discover the topics that their readers care about. Through Reddit’s publisher tools, such as our integration with CrowdTangle, publishers can track social commentary about their content, source unique content, and engage directly with communities discussing their content. Member companies can also engage via Reddit’s Ask Me Anything (AMA) format. As a platform for open dialogue with the Reddit community, AMAs serve as an optimal approach for building brand affinity and trust. Given the wide range of Reddit communities, AMAs with all types of reporters give publishers the opportunity to contribute a unique perspective or even showcase an obscure beat. As an LMC partner, Reddit will also host a series of webinars to help the LMC’s members learn how to discover stories and authentically engage with the Reddit community. Where Local Media Thrives Today Some of Reddit’s most popular AMAs on city or state-specific topics have been from local publishers. Redditors are eager to discuss the stories and issues around them, and local media are able to add a valuable context whether it’s about sports, local politics, or rising issues. For example: With over 330 million monthly active users, Reddit is a network of communities where people can find experiences built around their interests, hobbies, and passions.

I’m u/cartographer and coincidentally Reddit’s cartographer, which is an actual job here at Reddit! I spend my time mapping out the landscape of communities on Reddit for other teams to make awesome features for you. Venturing through the lesser known parts of Reddit is one of the best parts of the job, and most recently, that was sifting through original content. Original content on Reddit Recently we identified original content––AKA OC––communities, which are communities that welcome and encourage redditors to share their original content. This was one step in launching a new OC tag feature that we announced here. OC can be anything from r/earthporn to r/crossstitch to r/simulated. How we find OC Programmatically catching OC is a bit tricky since some subreddits only allow OC and others allow a mix. A lot of communities utilize flair to tag OC, others enforce titling rules, and for some it’s implicit because of the rules of the subreddit. We specifically looked for communities tagging or mentioning terms such as: OC, original, WIP. We also took a look at phrases such as “I made,” “I drew,” “I cooked,” and “I wrote.” I never could have guessed the types of communities that would show up, like r/impastabuildings. While all of these are truly amazing works of art, they might not be OC. We ended up with something to the tune of 1,600 candidates for Reddit Original Content, based on rules and definitions we created that required a certain level of overall activity and the proper ratio of original to standard content in a subreddit. The final list was around 300 subreddits averaging 660,000 subscribers in each subreddit.

And because redditors self-select by subscribing to the communities they care about most, where they engage in in-depth conversation, they are viewed as experts. In fact, according to a Reddit audience television survey, users rank the site 2nd only to in-person conversation and first for discovery of what to watch next. Where do Reddit users go most often to talk about their favorite shows?

In the time since, we’ve highlighted a variety of different stories, communities and personalities and have been listed in a variety of top podcasts of 2018, two Apple Podcast features and three NPR One features. TIME said: “the show promises to develop into a worthy rival to Reply All & This American Life.” Thank you for listening! Our vision for Endless Thread When we launched Endless Thread a large part of our mission was to highlight stories from Reddit with the help of redditors, and could be enjoyed by anyone with just the right amount of “inside baseball.” Since then, that mission has evolved into much more. From sourcing thought provoking or compelling community stories to highlighting issues and struggles redditors face, and calling upon a redditor with a knowledge in the subject-matter and interest in the topic to lend their voice. We’ve also been blown away by the artwork created and submitted by redditors, custom-made to accompany each episode. As we reflect on this first season of Endless Thread, we’d be remiss to skip an opportunity to highlight this original content that was featured with each episode. Gearing up for Season 2 Can’t get enough Endless Thread? You can catch up on season one on Apple Podcasts or your preferred podcast destination, and be sure not to miss the bonus episodes!

Chat rooms are now in beta and being released to more subreddits daily. Check out r/subchats or this post if you’d like to see how it works! Guess what? Chicken butt! (More on that later.) For now, hi! I’m u/ityoclys, but if you’re one of the 7,000 or so people who messaged the admins with your feedback on Chat, you may remember me better as u/reddit_chat_feedback. Most people still don’t know about Reddit Chat, so, for context, over the past year we’ve been beta testing a few new chat features with a small group of you. When we started, we knew that most people didn’t personally know other redditors, since the core of the Reddit experience is pseudonymous sharing and discussion, so we wanted to make sure there was a place for people in the betas to test chat, give feedback, and have a bit of fun. Perhaps most importantly, we wanted to get to know people using chat and learn from them. To do this, we made a new user, u/reddit_chat_feedback, and added it to the top of everyone’s chat contacts list. Kind of like Tom from Myspace. For some reason…I’m the one who volunteered to respond to all the early testers who chatted us up (or as many as I could keep up with). Turns out, that was a lot. So far I’ve chatted with more than 7,000 people one on one. It’s been fun, and I’d like to share some of the things we learned. This is my life now. TIL: chatting with strangers on the internet isn’t so scary If you haven’t used AOL in a while, the idea of chatting with people who feel uninhibited and disguised behind bizarre usernames might give you pause. This may seem especially true when you consider using chat as a feedback channel on a platform like Reddit, which is widely known for its passionate and vocal communities. I was initially afraid that most people would bring out the pitchforks and… unkind words. I was pleasantly surprised to find that most people are actually quite nice. The nature of real-time, direct chat seems to be especially disarming. Even when people initially lash out in frustration or to troll, I found that if you talk to them and show them you’re a regular human like them, they almost always chill out. Beyond just chilling out, people who are initially harsh or skeptical of new things will actually often change their minds. Sometimes they get so excited that they start to show up in unexpected places defending the thing they once strongly opposed in a way that feels more authentic than anything I could say. TLDR (again): don’t be afraid. Listen to people and talk to them, and everything will (usually) be fine. People are good. TIL: people will give you excellent and actionable feedback, if you’re willing to listen Chat as a feedback mechanism has been incredibly valuable. It’s been a great way to gauge general sentiment as we introduce the new products and features we’re building, but it’s also allowed the community to share direct feedback and poke holes in our ideas that directly impact our product roadmaps. I’m a product designer. I take pride in bringing clarity to our product and engineering ideas, but I also recognize that one person or even an entire team working on something new will never match the insights that a community of passionate people can find. Being the voice of u/reddit_chat_feedback has dramatically reinforced that framework — both for myself and my team. Listing everything we learned about chat via chat would result in a novella, but here are a few common themes that surfaced through chat feedback, and how we adapted to them: Redditors like cats. I do too. In fact I have two, and they’re very cute.One of the most impactful (and common) learnings from testing chat was that, on Reddit, it makes more sense for chat to serve a group dedicated to a specific topic than it does for one-on-one communication. This is a bit obvious in retrospect, but initially came as a surprise given so many of the chat platforms out there connect people who already know each other IRL. People on Reddit don’t usually know each other IRL (that’s kind of the point), which means they aren’t sure who to chat with without a common interest, and 1:1 communication can feel a bit random and unnatural. This understanding came to shape our roadmap in a big way: we shifted our team’s focus to building subreddit-based chat rooms before giving access to Direct chat to all Redditors.No one wants Reddit to become [insert generic social media platform here]. This is good. Neither do we! Personally, I like a lot of social sites on the internet, but one of the things I enjoy most about Reddit is the freedom that it gives people to express themselves without worrying that their grandparents will judge them.Large group chat rooms need powerful, easy-to-use moderation features. We were pretty sure this was true, but the validation we received via chat feedback was strong. That said, we made moderation features a major priority for our roadmap early in the process.People want to discover and share awesome subreddits. When you get to know someone in a real time context, sometimes it becomes easier for you to understand their tastes, and share stuff you think they’d like. For instance, I learned about r/pigifs, r/fairiesridingcorgis, and r/specializedtools. Yes, cat in French is chat. TIL: the internet is full of funny, witty, and weird people (jk I already knew that) Ok so I didn’t exactly learn about this via chat feedback, but I thought you might like to experience some of the funnier things I’ve experienced so far in chat. Like the first time u/reddit_chat_feedback reached the front page. And the second time (one day later). Thanks r/madlads! Or the time I recited the alphabet with someone from A to AZ (yes we cycled through the alphabet at least twice over a few days). Or the time someone sent me the entire script to Star Wars Episode 3 (we added a max message length after that one…). Or the time I learned about snails. Anyway here you go. T2P: 1 month Snails: the more you learn. TIL: how to make it to the front page Some very mad lads tricked me at and then tricked me again one point. My chat inbox was absolute madness for at least a week. But it was fun to be referenced on the front page. Chicken butt. Got ’em. We want to keep learning Using u/reddit_chat_feedback as a way to get to know and learn from Redditors has been fun and incredibly insightful. We can’t thank everyone who has talked with us and given feedback enough. But we’d like to hear more. If you want to talk about chat on Reddit, share a cat fact, or tell us about a niche subreddit, please get in touch! I’ll end with a cat fact: did you know that a group of cats is called a clowder. It’s true. I learned it on Reddit. By the way, should also check out the new community based chat rooms in beta, if you haven’t already. It’s a great way to discuss topics you’re interested in with people you don’t know in real life. I’m in a bunch of them, and I’d love to chat with you."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/5-tips-for-advertising-on-reddit","date":"2018-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product & Design"],"title":"5 Tips for Advertising on Reddit","text":"Kaitlyn Roche, Brand Strategist People come to Reddit to discover and discuss the most timely and relevant content and ideas from around the world. With over 330M+ visitors every month, Reddit’s communities are spaces where users are free to explore their interests in-depth and engage in conversation around what matters most to them. It’s no wonder that redditors are considered the tastemakers of the internet –– they are opinionated, culturally aware and highly conscious of brands and products. This presents a unique opportunity for brands to connect with their audiences in creative ways through Reddit Advertising, but also requires guidance on how to do it right. Reddit’s Brand Strategy team is in place to guide brand thinking across our network of communities. We know the power and influence these users exert over shaping opinions online. Whether you’re a seasoned redditor or new to Reddit, here’s the TL;DR on some best practices to follow. Know your audience Reddit is a collection of nearly 150K+ communities that span every topic imaginable. Interested in reaching soon-to-be moms? There’s a subreddit for that. How about sneaker addicts? We’ve got that too. Nailing down your audience is key, but even more important is finding the right communities that align with your campaign and really listening to what they have to say before jumping in. The best campaigns on Reddit lean into topics and conversations that users are actively taking part in, leading to valuable insights that will guide your campaign and approach. The Handmaid’s Tale in r/WritingPrompts Surrounding the premiere of The Handmaid’s Tale, Hulu partnered with Reddit to engage creative storytellers in r/WritingPrompts – a community devoted to users sourcing and sharing original story ideas. Reddit’s Brand Strategy team partnered with Hulu and followed the community’s lead, crafting story prompts that alluded to the show’s dystopian themes, resulting in high engagement from users and more than 200+ original stories written by redditors. Create an experience that’s uniquely Reddit Log into Reddit and you will find a vast Internet-world filled with long-form user generated content, acronyms, memes and AMAs all vying for your attention. In fact, content trends move so fast on Reddit, you may quickly find yourself r/OutOfTheLoop. You’ve entered an environment that is both unique and sacred to its users, meaning that advertising is subject to different standards than you would find on other platforms. Ads that look and feel like a natural part of the Reddit experience and display an understanding of what’s authentic to the community will go volumes beyond a one-size-fits-all campaign. Anki – Cozmo Lost in Reddit Robotics start-up Anki partnered with Reddit to host Cozmo Lost in Reddit – a live-streamed interactive game that challenged redditors to guide its toy robot Cozmo through a web of Reddit-themed physical escape rooms. By playing into the participatory nature of Reddit, this activation went beyond traditional advertising to create a communal experience that paid tribute to subreddit culture in lockstep with its members. Add value (AKA, up your karma) On Reddit, your influence isn’t a function of followers, it’s about what you contribute to the community that matters. This is reflected by your karma score. Users come to share valuable information with each other and want to discover new things that are relevant to their passions, which also includes ads. To truly connect with your audience on Reddit, go beyond driving sales to start a compelling conversation that advances their interests and supports the ongoing dialogue within the community. In turn, the trust and credibility you earn will help you become an integral part of their conversation. L’Oreal in r/SkincareAddiction L’Oreal partnered with Reddit to engage r/SkincareAddiction in meaningful conversation around acne. The brand asked the community to share their LPTs (Life Pro Tips) for managing acne during flare-ups — a concern that’s widely discussed across all of Reddit’s skincare communities. By facilitating the dialogue around a topic that matters to the audience, the campaign received hundreds of comments from redditors who had valuable advice to share with one another. Interact with the community The most successful Reddit ads are comprised of more than a just a great headline, but an interactive comments thread. Reddit is more than the discovery and sharing of content, but also discussion. By encouraging and participating in conversation in your comments thread, you’re building a relationship with the Reddit community. Think about what type of conversation you want to encourage and put a call to action in your ad copy. Then, find ways to acknowledge the conversation as a brand and, as a thank you for their participation, consider rewarding users for their dialogue. Toyota’s RAV4 Adventure Guide Toyota partnered with Reddit to promote the RAV4 amongst outdoor and nature enthusiasts by asking the community to share their best words of advice for nature newbies. As the advice poured in, Toyota responded back by sharing an interactive outdoor guide featuring the best words of wisdom shared by redditors, creating a two-way engagement between the brand and outdoor enthusiasts with content that aligned with their passions. Be transparent Anonymity on Reddit allows users to be their true selves, which makes it one of the most transparent and human corners of the web. With Reddit, brands have a chance to prove to their audience that there are faces and real people behind your company, which is why we see best performing ads are often casual and friendly in tone. A good rule of thumb is if you brand were a person, what would they say? Try engaging with users in plain language, no marketing-speak. Sincerity is key with redditors. A sense of humor and personality can go a long way in shaping the conversation for your brand, even enticing your audience to interact with your brand and its content. Netflix’s Wet Hot American Summer To create buzz around the Wet Hot American Summer reboot, Netflix engaged the Reddit community with an open-ended prompt related to the show. By ditching the marketing-speak in favor of witty humor and self-awareness (re: blatantly calling out the promotional nature of the ad), Netflix was able to get over 600+ redditors to share their most awkward childhood camp stories with one another.

For more on our guidelines, how we’ve been testing and collecting feedback in the News tab alpha on iOS, see our initial update: Making it easier Reddit is unique and powerful because of its communities who share, vote and discuss content.

By the numbers We took a look at the data and found redditors in r/soccer are highly engaged, driving more than 22M monthly engagements (posts, comments and votes) in the 30 days before the World Cup. Since the start of the tournament, that number has jumped to 35M engagements, +59% increase, and the community has grown to more than 1 million subscribers. Congrats football fans, worldwide! On average, redditors also spend more time engaging in r/soccer than in other top subreddits, such as r/sports (9.5x more), r/music (9.2x more) and r/movies (3.5x more).

Some bit of background on Reddit video: We first launched Reddit video hosting in August 2017. Since then, it’s become core to the Reddit experience. About a year after we launched native video, it’s now the dominant way people are viewing and posting video content (Reddit users have a natural affinity for organic native video) –– and that presents a huge opportunity for advertisers. By the numbers: More than 2x video views, growing 23% each month since the start of 2018.We’re now averaging more than 5 million minutes of views per day. This doesn’t account for spikes in viral content, which we’ve seen jump to ~100M in a day.Since launching, videos uploaded via our native player receive twice as many views as YouTube videos on Reddit.Native video has taken off in a variety of communities and now accounts for as much as 20% of content in a number of major communities such as r/oddlysatisfying, r/aww and r/FortniteBR for example. So what does this mean for advertisers? There’s a massive opportunity with video ads on Reddit, which we’ve been testing, refining and improving alongside several key partners across the gaming, entertainment and auto industries. In fact, we’ve seen engagement and performance lifts up to 5x when compared to non-video campaigns. Today, we’re introducing a new video ad product with improved engagement, targeting, performance-based bidding and measurement capabilities. The native video ads product is a big step in our effort to optimize the redesign for both users and advertisers. It marries the best of the redesign for advertisers (card view) with the updates our users are most excited about (video hosting). Specifically, video ads are now: Available on a cost per view (CPV) basisPreviously, Reddit Ads were purchased on a CPM basisAvailable for video-only campaigns, which means advertisers can now target card view only in the redesign and mobile appsFully native across platforms so you can leverage standard Reddit engagement characteristics (upvotes, downvotes and more!)In-feed native videos autoplayAds are displayed in the redesign’s expanded card view format, which makes them better looking and more engaging Video Ads will start rolling out today, Tuesday June 12, and will be available to all advertisers over the course of the Summer.

Ever since we created r/redesign to gather feedback from users about the redesign, we’ve been seeing one particular piece of feedback quite frequently: And we heard you! This feature exists today on our native mobile applications, and also exists in the old desktop site through RES, so we definitely wanted to support it natively on the redesign. However, before starting work on Night Mode, we had to fix the way that we handled colors in our application. We needed to update our system of colors to be more unified across the site, removing ad-hoc colors, providing access to the colors in every product surface, and setting up the website to support multiple color themes. The Design team worked hard on creating a smaller color system, using one already in place for our native mobile apps as a basis. This also allowed us to ensure that the experience was consistent over all our platforms. It also improves the accuracy for our colors since relying on a key that automatically changes with Night Mode removes the risk of overlooking how a component should look in Night Mode. We began implementing the new color system by going through each usage of the old one and replacing it with the new color system, leveraging new designs the team had drawn up. This effort touched more than 5000 lines of code and allowed us to remove a net 1500 lines of no longer necessary code! This will also make changing colors going forward a lot easier, since we only have to update them in one place. These updates allowed us to develop a Night Mode theme, which we rolled out to employees for testing a few weeks back. Now that the admins have spent some time squashing bugs, we are excited to share it with you! To start browsing Reddit in darkness, click on your username in the upper right hand corner, and then toggle it on.

For the past 5 years, we’ve announced social experiments and encouraged the community to collaborate in different ways. Our April Fool’s celebration is more than a fun gag, it’s a unique social experiment that gives us insight into our community, and a tool that allows us to test new technologies, understand their impact on our infrastructure and pressure-test new feature performance at scale. More than that, Reddit’s April Fools tradition allows us to engage with the community in new and interesting ways, highlighting emerging behaviors and trends across the platform. It’s one of the best opportunities we have to think philosophically about the Internet and human connection in a very Reddit-y, meta-like fashion. Circle of Trust This year, we launched Reddit’s Circle of Trust, an experiment that allowed each user to create one –– and only one –– circle with a title and secret key. Users could invite others to join their circles by sharing the link and a secret key of their choosing. The invited user had the ability to join or betray the circle. If they decided to join, they would grow the circle and were given the option to extend the invitation to other users. If they betrayed the circle, they would close the circle permanently and get marked with a scarlet letter. Users were also given flair next to their usernames that displayed two separate numbers. The first was the number of people in your personal circle. The second was the number of active circles you joined. If a circle you were in got betrayed, the second number would decrease by one. Behind-the-scenes Communication and collaboration are two of the most important themes and factors we consider when coming up with our April Fools experiments. This year, we were particularly influenced by ideas from classic game theory such as the prisoner’s dilemma, board games like Secret Hitler, The Scarlet Letter, and of course, Meet the Parents. Once we landed on the idea, we started iterating and kicked off the technical implementation. We were left with just one month to get the code finalized and compatible across 4 different platforms; the old desktop site, the redesign, Android and iOS. The joke’s on… us? A few days in advance of our launch, we decided to drop a few hints about what was to come. Our lead backend engineer (u/miamiZ) dropped a subtle comment with an ASCII art snake in a discussion thread about April Fool’s, to symbolize the idea of trust and betrayal. It was a wholesome and friendly exchange, but on April Fool’s morning, users waited for the project to drop. What they didn’t know was that they would have to wait until Monday… April 2. We started leaving clues, like hidden text in a tooltip over our logo with the intention of acknowledging the community’s curiosity and drumming up further excitement. As it turns out, dragging out the anticipation lead to a bit of confusion and, ultimately, some disappointment, so we decided to officially announce the 4/2 launch. When we explicitly announced that there was a plan for April Fool’s in-the-works, the mood started to turn around. Our savvy community of redditors started decompiling our Android app, inspecting our minified JavaScript and found references to Circle of Trust. Launch time On Monday, April 2, at precisely 9:00 a.m. PT, we launched Circle of Trust. Unfortunately, we hit a snag where we were leaking secret keys due to last-minute code change that made it easier to share your circle. It took another hour, but we were finally ready. Shortly after, we started seeing reports of flairs being slow to update, and users having issues joining and betraying circles. After a couple hours of things continuing to slow, we decided to temporarily close the subreddit while we investigated. This is where we learned the queue was backed up, meaning users couldn’t see the results of their actions (posts, comments). Here’s how our engineers describe what happened next: Think of the entrance to your favorite tourist attraction. Generally visitors come in small groups at a steady rate allowing entrance workers to accommodate the flow of traffic. Occasionally a busload of visitors shows up at once, clogging up the line. The entrance can handle a steady stream of buses, but if the group size continues to grow, the swell will overwhelm the entrance workers. During r/CircleofTrust, each time we scaled our infrastructure to accomodating the influx of activities, we allowed for an increase in visitor bus size, which completely overwhelmed our poor entrance workers, stopping people from getting into the main attraction. Once we were able to alleviate the load on the queue, we were able to get back up-and-running, opening up the gates once more, to the main attraction, r/CircleofTrust. What we learned We learned a lot from users’ behavior during the experiment too. Specifically, we were interested in learning more about how users’ would go about building trust with strangers. The experiment’s mechanics allowed users to come up with behaviors beyond what we could have predicted, including trusting those with similarly-sized circles, creating mutually-assured destruction and last, but not least, that April Fool’s should be celebrated with a 4/1 launch. We also observed how users leveraged chat to build a rapport before establishing trust. It became custom for the smaller circle to state their key first. Being involved in a key exchange was nerve-wracking for all, but it also produced our favorite meme from the experiment. Lastly, we noticed people sending compliments to each other, which proved to be one of the best ways to gain entry, or at the very least, start a conversation. What we learned from our users is that even in the most cut-throat situations, positive engagements was a way to demonstrate good faith and, ultimately, one of the best paths forward when beginning to build trust. We saw the inverse here too, where redditors would band together to betray as many circles as possible. This group called themselves the Circular Swarm. We guess there will always be people who just want to see the world burn! All of this, of course, supports what we all know to be true: Our community is smarter, more creative, and always one step ahead of us. Outcome Throughout the projects’ many highs and lows, we were reminded that the fact that our community cares enough to engage so enthusiastically is a gift in and of itself. While there are over 138,000 active communities on Reddit, Circle of Trust gave many users their first ever experience creating and effectively running their very own mini-communities. Expanding your circle has its challenges, both online and off-, and our team was happy to get the opportunity to explore some of those challenges through this project.

We doubled in size last year, and we’re on track to do it again in 2018. We’ve built out incredible teams across the company, for everything from employee experience to media partnerships. And earlier this month, we launched the most ambitious undertaking in the history of our company: redesigning our site to make it more welcoming for millions of users. In short, we’re firing on all cylinders here at Reddit HQ, so we wanted to take a moment to share why now is the best time to join the team, whether you’re just starting your career or are a professional with 10+ years of experience. Here’s what we did last year to make Reddit an exceptional place to work… Last year, our VP of Engineering explained some of the thinking behind the way we hire: in order to make Reddit a home for everyone in the world, we have to start by making our office a better reflection of the world. But our work doesn’t stop when we bring new employees (or “Snoos,” as we call them) in the door. Over the past two years, we’ve worked hard to make sure everything waiting for new Snoos after they join—the benefits, events, career development opportunities, and day-to-day support—is in place to make this the best job of their careers. A few of the things we’ve introduced to make that happen: Our Talent Development team leveled up our performance management system from a 6-month review cycle to a continuous system based on individual skills, which allows our employees to get raises and promotions on a schedule aligned with their achievements.We founded our first-ever University program, so we can help the next generation of talent start their careers.We doubled down on our support for internal programming that our Snoos wanted most: employee resource groups, career development workshops, a continuous speaker series with industry leaders, and hosted events to give back to the community.We’ve also worked hard to create a unique Employee Experience and our own tight-knit community through a diverse array of company events, including St. Patrick’s Day trivia night, Oktoberfest, terrarium-building, screenprinting, game nights, quarterly offsites, and so much more. Long story short, we take care of our people, so they can take care of our users. We also revamped our values to help guide us in the right direction as we work through our 2018 roadmap. Here are the five tenets that guide us: Evolve: We grow together towards the future. Our business and the context in which we run it is constantly changing. We are humble and know that learning never stops.Remember the Human: We treat others the way we would like to be treated, and we remember our actions affect real people. We are not assholes, and we ensure that Reddit plays a positive role in people’s lives.Act Like an Owner: Our mission is larger than what any individual can accomplish on their own. Think beyond yourself and your team. When making decisions, put Reddit’s mission first.Keep Reddit Real: Be yourself. Encourage others to be themselves. Diversity and authenticity are what make Reddit work.Results Matter: Whether your work is in service of your fellow Snoos, users, customers, or partners, what matters most is delivering them value. The balance between quality and speed is settled by what works best for your customer. Each of these principles will keep us grounded as we grow as a company and continue to work towards our mission of making Reddit a more welcoming place for everyone. Come work with us! Right now, Reddit is the 4th most popular site in the U.S. and 6th in the world. We have more than 330 million unique users per month and just over 300 employees total, which means that everyone who works here has an enormous opportunity to make a real impact with their work. We’ve got big plans for 2018, and the only way we can accomplish them is with a team of passionate, talented humans who are excited to help us build an even better community in the coming year, both on our site and in our office.

Over the past year, we’ve worked to build out better business tools and advertising experiences that are effective, engaging, and truly cross-platform. As Reddit has become a daily destination for more people across desktop and mobile, our ad business has grown with it: more than doubling year-over year with 5x growth since 2015. Last quarter, we introduced our in-app native ads, Promoted Posts for iOS, and today we’re excited to extend that roll-out to Android, making them available across all platforms including mobile web. With all the elements of a standard Reddit post, including upvotes, downvotes, and comment threads, these Promoted Posts bring a better experience to our Android app, both for advertisers and users alike. With the launch of Promoted Posts on iOS, we saw more than a 300% increase in our click-through rates. We’re excited to see how today’s launch bolsters engagement with ads on Android as well. So what’s new? Native format: Ads look and feel like other posts on Reddit, with a link to the user profile, upvotes, downvotes, and comments, along with a simple label reading “Promoted.”Image ads: Relatively new for Reddit ads and previously only available on mobile web, image ads are now in all of our apps, where around 85% of people view content in card view (i.e., with images expanded in their feed).Video ads: For select managed advertisers, Promoted Posts support video ads to quickly engage a brand’s target audience.Platform parity: Our redesign supports both card-view and classic-view ads, compared to our old desktop site, which only supported ads with thumbnails, making our Promoted Posts consistent across all of the ways users experience Reddit. Promoted Posts on Android will launch on Wednesday, April 25th.

Our new scholarship of $150,000 enables us to provide greater access for women of diverse backgrounds to attend Hackbright. We’re so excited for our increased partnership and the ability to empower more women to gain the skills they need to become software engineers. “I believe it’s important to invest in diversity and inclusiveness for better products, for better teams, and because it’s just the right thing to do,” said Nick Caldwell, VP of Engineering. “My first week on the job at Reddit, I met with students from Hackbright Academy and was completely blown away by their intensity, drive, and potential.” Since 2016, we’ve partnered with Hackbright through activities including 360° interview feedback sessions, whiteboarding events for Hackbright students and alumnae, and mentorship. We’re committed to improving diversity and inclusivity in tech. This new scholarship introduces three tiers of opportunities for women looking to join Hackbright, including full- and part-time software engineering programs, which enable women to learn necessary skills to enter the industry as full-stack developers. These new scholarships reflect our mission to improve equality in tech for underrepresented groups. Scholarships will be awarded based on a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to: need, technical expertise, and belonging to part of a group that has been historically underrepresented in STEM (e.g., Black, LatinX, American Indian, LGBTQ+, first-generation, and/or people with disabilities). “In the years I’ve been involved with Hackbright Academy as a mentor, I’ve seen Hackbright pave the path for hundreds of women to launch their careers in technology. Hackbright’s mission is one that Reddit stands behind and has long supported through mentorship, which is why it’s a natural next step for us to now expand our collaboration with Hackbright,” said Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. “With this scholarship fund, we hope to help Hackbright empower even more women looking to begin new careers in tech.” Visit the Hackbright site for details or to apply for the Code Reddit scholarship."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddits-expanding-to-chicago","date":"2018-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Reddit’s Expanding to Chicago!","text":"Today, we’re excited to announce the latest addition to Reddit’s growing Brand Partnerships team: Rob Sprungman, who will be expanding our sales presence throughout the Midwest as the Senior Director, Central Brand Partnerships (plus, we’re hiring!). Introducing Rob Sprungman Rob is a well-known figure in Chicago’s digital advertising industry with 15 years of experience leading in the digital ad and marketing space. As an early adopter of digital, he helped build digital sales functions for a number of firms from the ground up, driving mobile advertising even before the iPhone was launched. After lending his talents to a number of emerging businesses across the Midwest, Rob went on to open the first Midwest Sales offices for Electronic Arts and deliver strategic initiatives for major brands like McDonald’s, Ford, and Target. In 2007, Rob joined AdMob to lead their Midwest Sales team, where he cemented himself as a leader in the fast-growing mobile industry and built partnerships with Fortune 500 companies. After AdMob’s acquisition by Google, Rob led Google’s mobile practice for the American auto vertical. Most recently, Rob led the Midwest Sales for mobile location ad-targeting leader Thinknear by Telenav (TNAV). The Next Step in Reddit’s Brand Partnerships Evolution Reddit is quickly becoming a daily destination for more people across desktop and mobile—and the growth in our ads business reflects this momentum. As Reddit becomes an increasingly valuable part of any brand’s advertising and social engagement strategy, our Brand Partnerships team has upped its game in every category to make these engagements more impactful. On the Product front, we launched an entirely new self-serve advertising platform, video ads, and, just last month, native promoted posts in our mobile apps. We’ve expanded our presence outside of San Francisco, with rapidly growing teams in Los Angeles and New York and appearances at major events like Cannes and SXSW. Our team has helped bring innovative new campaigns to Reddit, like an interactive live-stream and a live premiere of an animated TV series. And best of all, our ads business has more than doubled year-over-year, with 5x growth in revenue over the last three years. The new Chicago office marks the next step in our Brand Partnerships team’s rapid evolution, and a massive opportunity to expose new brands to our ads business. But Reddit’s new office isn’t just an investment in the region of the Midwest; it’s also an investment in the industries of the Midwest. For example, the past year of brand partnerships growth at Reddit has demonstrated lots of potential for growth with the automotive industry and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies. To support all of this exciting work, we’re planning to hire a small but world-class team in Chicago and Detroit by the end of the year.

Over the past three years, our teams have grown Reddit’s business in just about every measure, from product rollouts and new tools for advertisers to increasing both our physical headcount and revenue numbers by 5x. With Jen at the helm as COO, we’re excited to look back at those milestones as just the beginning. “I’m proud of how much we’ve accomplished in such a short amount of time,” said CEO Steve Huffman. “Just this year, we rewrote our tech stack, launched the desktop redesign, introduced native promoted posts, to name a few. As the business and company expands I’m excited to have Jen join us a thought partner to me and the rest of the team as we continue to welcome new users, clients and partners.” He continued, “Jen is a seasoned digital veteran and successful executive at some of the biggest media companies in the world, her experience and vision will help carry Reddit’s momentum forward in the years to come.” An Expert in the Digital Landscape Jen first began her career as an entrepreneur, co-founding a children’s entertainment startup before joining McKinsey & Company’s Telecom, Media, and Technology practice. In 2010, Jen brought her leadership to AOL as Global Head of Business Operations, where she oversaw major acquisitions of companies like TechCrunch, 5Min, and The Huffington Post. She also served as General Manager and Senior Vice President for some of the company’s biggest brands. After AOL, Jen became Chief Business Officer at PopSugar, Inc., where she led the company’s day-to-day operations, business, and product engineering while bringing global growth to the company’s media entities. In 2015, she became Time, Inc.’s President of Digital, earning a promotion soon after that to become Chief Operating Officer. At Time, Jen shepherded the company’s digital and interactive strategies, operations, consumer marketing, and revenue, streamlining and expanding the business as she oversaw dozens of online media properties, like People, Fortune, and Sports Illustrated.

Leading the Next Phase of Reddit’s Evolution In her new role, Jen will be based in Reddit’s New York office, where she’ll oversee business strategy and related teams for the company. Her goals as COO will align closely with her past experience at Time, PopSugar, and AOL: using her media, publisher, advertising, and operations expertise to help us build out our offerings for users, advertisers, and partners; applying her experience building successful digital advertising offerings for internet media giants to our own ads platform; and, through it all, working to grow our business while staying true to the things that make Reddit unique. “Reddit has a community unlike any other on the internet, where people can be themselves and have authentic conversations,” she said. “This honesty can be intimidating, whether you’re a new user or an advertiser, but I believe it’s not only the reason behind Reddit’s success, but the future of the internet as a whole.” Jen’s leadership will go beyond growing the business. She’s also passionate about a company goal that’s just as important as revenue at Reddit: diversity and inclusion.

Last year, we shared a few blog posts explaining some of the interesting technical challenges we face here at Reddit. From fixing search (again), to how we route requests to different stacks, to (one of my favourites) counting the number of people who’ve viewed a piece of content, among several others, we’ve covered a very small part of what it is our technical teams do here. One area we haven’t covered much of yet is our data systems. There’s always room for improvement in our systems, whether it’s adding more functionality, scaling to handle more throughput, or throwing everything out the window and starting from scratch. I’ve been here for all of it. And as Reddit’s very first dedicated data engineering hire, I get credit for more than my fair share of mistakes and bad decisions along the way. This blog post will be the first of three taking you through the history of data engineering at Reddit. Over the course of the series, I’m going to talk a bit about what we did, and why we did it. More importantly, I’ll talk a bit about what problems we ran into along the way, and what we did to solve them. During my on-site interview at Reddit, I remember asking what the current data architecture looks like. What technologies are used? What do the data pipelines and ETL systems look like? How many people are working on this, and how does it integrate into product decisions? The answers astounded me: Reddit used the free tier of Google Analytics. There were no pipelines or ETL. There was one PM who was manually running a small collection of PIG scripts on EMR, parsing HAProxy logs to get DAU/MAU numbers. This was a golden opportunity to build up data systems from scratch for a company with a massive user base, and it was an opportunity I didn't plan to miss out on. The early days I still remember the first time I met our co-founder Alexis Ohanian. As I explained what I was hoping we could accomplish by having product instrumentation in place, he said to me, “Back in the early days, we just had to make all our decisions based on gut instinct.” That was a pretty good summary of how things were done back then: gut instinct. Reddit had to be careful about changes; if a change was rolled out, and users complained, we had no effective way to determine whether those complaints were a vocal minority, or were representative of all users. The new data team at Reddit had our work cut out for us: make Reddit a data-driven company. Change product development from a world of gut-instinct change and reacting based solely on user feedback, to a world where data drives not only product ideas, but implementation, experimentation, and iteration as well. Make Reddit a data-literate company; a place where any employee can find top-line metrics, and can analyze everything relevant to their space. Digging through access logs Initially, we had two primary sources of data from which to try to pull insights (besides the aforementioned Google Analytics): HAProxy logs and pixel-tracking logs. These respective logs would eventually give us information about our content, such as what posts and comments receive the most engagement, as well as where, when, and on what device—with a handy breakdown of 3rd-party app traffic vs. web traffic and other critical insights into our community and products. PIG scripts were a great start, and while they provided invaluable data at the time, we quickly realized we were going to need a more robust approach in order to get the insights we wanted. At the time, Reddit had very limited engineering resources to dedicate to this work (only one engineer), so we needed to come up with an approach that would allow us to iterate on changes quickly, add new data sources with minimal effort, and scale to Reddit's traffic volumes right out of the gate (for context, HAProxy logs alone are more than 500 GB per day). To this end, we opted to start with a simple MapReduce job to create our first iteration of a data warehouse. This would allow us to generate basic, but more usable output than from the raw logs, and, since the raw logs were deleted after 90 days, would allow us to keep data indefinitely. I had some experience with maintaining a Hadoop cluster in my previous job and had no desire to start down that road just yet. To do so would add a lot of operational overhead that we didn't have the manpower to support. Furthermore, keeping a cluster up at all times when it's only being used in bursts (daily or hourly, as logs became available to process) was also an expensive proposition. Using Amazon’s Elastic MapReduce allowed us to bring up and shut down clusters on demand, and since the data would come from and be written back out to S3, we had no need to keep a cluster up to retain data in HDFS. Making logs queryable In order to do any real analysis on this data, we had to be able to query it. Writing a script or a MapReduce job every time you wanted to dig in to the data to get some insights would obviously not scale well, so we needed a simple way to be able to write queries. Additionally, with the volume of raw data available, it would be nonsensical to run queries against raw data for everything. Enter Apache Hive. With Hive, we were able to define a warehouse and tables, and we were able to write SQL queries that would then get transformed into MapReduce jobs and run across our EMR cluster. Hive relies on a metastore to keep all information about tables (schemas, data storage locations, etc). This metastore, by default, lives on the Hadoop cluster itself, but you can define it to be in an external location. By creating our metastore on a separate MySQL instance, we kept the ability to spin up and shut down clusters on demand, which is something we do to this day (though not in EMR anymore). Extract, Transform, Load (ETL): V1 While getting our HAProxy and pixel logs into a queryable format in Hive was the first big step, we needed some tools to run queries on a schedule, build reporting and aggregation tables, and visualize the data. Our first version of ETL used Azkaban for dependency management and Jenkins for scheduling. Jenkins is typically used for scheduling builds, but we were able to use it to talk to an Azkaban server to trigger ETL jobs. Jenkins would run a Python script on an hourly or daily basis, which would construct a SQL query or series of queries based on a set of input parameters. Jenkins would then submit the job to Azkaban, which would run the jobs and manage interdependencies between them. Once this system was up and running, Jenkins would also be configured to trigger the HAProxy and pixel processing jobs. After so many years without a robust data system, having answers to key questions at our fingertips was great. Our new system gave us a lot of power to help determine whether we were building the right product features for our community and determine the potential impact of new ideas. And yet, there was still one missing piece. We needed to be able to visualize the data. After all, charts and graphs are way easier to interpret at a glance than sequences of numbers! Who wants a book with no pictures? When we started our search, we spoke with several vendors and looked at a variety of data-visualization tools. In the end, we settled on a third-party, closed source product, largely to lighten the load of having to maintain and support something internally with our limited resources. The tool we used did not support using Hive as a backend, and given the speed of even relatively basic Hive queries, it wouldn't make much sense to use that for reporting metrics. A dashboard that takes 10 minutes to load isn't a particularly useful dashboard! Fortunately, a simple MySQL database on Amazon’s RDS presented a really simple solution; since the volume of data in a reporting table is small, this solution would scale for the foreseeable future, and our ETL jobs could write out there with a simple modification. This was a great start, but the one major piece missing was making it easy for the less technical folks at the company to be able to query data. With the above system, you would have to SSH into the Hive cluster to run your queries. Wide-open access aside, that's a painful approach for anyone. It also meant that we couldn't scale easily to a huge number of queries. We could spin up a new EMR cluster every time, but there's a nontrivial amount of technical overhead involved there. Fortunately, we found a third-party vendor who provide a nice centralized system for running queries, configuring and managing clusters (Hive, in our case, but they support a number of technologies), access controls, etc. This allowed us to create a number of clusters, and anyone could log in to run their queries.

Today, Boston’s NPR news station WBUR premiered a brand new podcast in partnership with Reddit. Titled Endless Thread (as a nod to Reddit’s ever-entertaining comment threads), the show brings to life some of the most compelling stories on our site, with well-crafted audio narratives from host Ben Brock Johnson and producer Amory Sivertson. “As a journalist, I’ve been fascinated by Reddit for years, but I’ve also become an avid redditor,” Ben shares in a WBUR press release. “I’m always surprised at what a mystery Reddit is to people who don’t use it. I’m looking forward to solving that mystery for the uninitiated, and helping redditors share their incredible, real life stories with the world.” For the series premiere, Ben introduces listeners to Reddit’s nonononoyes community and kicks off the episode with a series of death-defying, IRL “nonononoyes” stories, from a photographer escaping a 100-foot waterfall to airline passengers who survived an engineering failure that sent their pilot halfway out of the cockpit in the middle of a flight. Between thoughtful interview segments and cheeky narration, Ben and Amory discuss the stories and chat about posts and comments they’ve found on Reddit, bouncing around communities large and small. (Even the credits include a few sneaky Reddit references.) “We’re going to listen to redditors tell their stories,” Ben shares at the top of the episode. “We are going to wade into the comments. It’s gonna be great! And weird, and fun, and, hopefully if we pay attention, we might even learn a thing or two.” Endless Thread is in good company at WBUR, the NPR station responsible for hit radio shows like Car Talk and acclaimed podcasts like Modern Love, the audio companion to the New York Times column by the same name. Over the course of this season, sponsored in part by Wistia video hosting and Zip Recruiter, listeners can expect a similar style of highly produced audio treatment with a unique, Reddit-y twist that takes you on a journey just as fascinating and unexpected as some of the best threads on our site. Upcoming episodes include a personal look at life on the edge of homelessness, a grand retelling of a benevolent wartime smuggler forgotten by history, a guided tour of pre-apocalyptic seed storage, and more wide-ranging stories inspired by Reddit threads. You can stream or download the premiere episode now from your podcast app of choice and discuss it here on Reddit. Be sure to subscribe to the show to get each new episode as soon as it comes out.

Today, iPhone and Android users will see some of the biggest upgrades to our mobile app experience since launching our apps last year. To inform this update, we sifted through feedback from users across our communities and prioritized the improvements that redditors wanted most—from an improved suite of mobile mod tools to an all-new theater mode experience. Here’s a quick tour of new features you’ll find in the latest update. Mod Tools, Mod Tools, Mod Tools Our number one focus with this update was improving our app for moderators, giving them all the tools they need to help their communities flourish directly from their phones. Here are just a few highlights: Mod Mode When mod mode is switched “on” in our mobile apps, mods will now be able to approve content, remove content, and flag content as spam within the communities they moderate. Mod Queue We know that moderating large communities can require a lot of work, so we’ve included support for bulk actions (e.g., addressing large numbers of similar reports at once) in our mobile mod queue. Mod queue is the primary view that moderators use to action content on desktop, and we’re happy to announce that it’s now possible from our apps. Modmail Mods will be able to access modmail from the new mod menu within communities that they moderate. Mod Management & Approved Submitters With a single front-page post, a small Reddit community can go from a handful of subscribers to tens of thousands overnight, and more subscribers means more moderators. By adding mod management to our apps, we wanted to ensure that all moderators have the tools they need to view and update their list of moderators quickly and conveniently. Mods now also have the ability to add and remove approved submitters to their community in the app. In addition to mod tools, this update includes a number of upgrades to our app experience that all users can enjoy. Theater Mode Theater mode is one of the features we’re most excited about with this update. While much of the magic of Reddit is in the comments and text-based discussions, Reddit is also home to some of the best visual content on the internet—from viral videos and humorous reaction gifs to original nature photography and pictures of evil buildings. Now, redditors can use theater mode to get a visual-first experience of their favorite communities. Live Comments (iOS) Reddit is one of the biggest destinations online for live updates on whatever you’re interested in, so we’ve worked hard to support live commenting in our iOS app. Whether you’re watching the latest episode of Game of Thrones with the superfans of r/gameofthrones, following game-day threads in r/NFL, or searching for breaking news updates on natural disasters, this update gives our mobile users a more real-time experience than ever before. Safari View Controller (iOS) This feature allows users to select Safari as their in-app browser, rather than using our native in-app browser. With this update, each user’s Safari settings will be respected when using it as a browser within our app. Post Flair Functionality For many communities on Reddit, flair is an important tool to distinguish different types of content, but in the past it’s been difficult to add on mobile. Now, it’s easier than ever for both users to modify flair from their phones. No desktop required. Comment Speed Read Button (Android) When we launched our app, we added a “speed read” button to the iOS app, which allows users to move quickly between the top-level comments in any given discussion on the site. We included it as a bonus feature at the time, but it’s been so popular that we’ve brought it to Android as well, making this a standard feature on all of our apps. In-Feed Usernames for OPs We’re constantly working to make sure the original content that makes Reddit so entertaining is attributed back to the users behind it who deserve the “creddit.” In the past two years, we launched embeds for posts and comments and made sharing posts easier through our recently released crosspost feature. With this update, we’re making sure the usernames behind the content are always visible by adding usernames to the app’s home feed. Trophy Case and Cake Day Redditors earn trophies for a wide range of accomplishments on the site, like having the best comment, submitting a link that sparks a lively discussion, participating in beta tests, or just spending another year as a redditor. As we continue to get more users whose first experience of Reddit is on the mobile app, making sure features like the trophy case live on in the apps is our way of preserving the legacy of our oldest users. Birthdays are great, but on Reddit, people really only care when it’s their “Cake Day,” or the anniversary of when they first became a redditor. (No really: just check out r/cakeday.) On this most sacred day, a user’s name reflects a small, pixelated cake icon on our desktop site. With this release, we’ve updated the look of our icon and made sure our mobile users know when to wish each other a happy Cake Day. Chat (iOS) Finally, we recently beta-launched Chat, our new real-time messaging feature. With this update, iOS users can test out Chat by opting in to the feature and having conversations with your fellow redditors (and giving us feedback by messaging u/chat_us_feedback!). What’s Next? This is just the start for the next wave of upgrades to our mobile apps. We’re looking forward to collecting more feedback—and rolling out more features redditors love—in the coming months."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-microsoft-power-bi-bing","date":"2017-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Reddit Partners With Microsoft to Deliver Intelligent Search Results and Business Intelligence Tools","text":"Today, we’re thrilled to announce a partnership two years in the making, harnessing the power of Microsoft’s artificial intelligence technology to deliver the best possible search experiences for Bing users and analytical tools for brands and marketers. As our co-founder Alexis Ohanian shared earlier today in his presentation at Microsoft’s AI conference, we’re kicking off the partnership by unveiling two new products that apply Microsoft’s AI tools to Reddit’s vast data: Bing Intelligent Search: first-ever search experiences returning Reddit results for AMAs, Questions, and Communities; andThe Power BI suite of solution templates for brand management and targeting on Reddit: a comprehensive set of business intelligence solutions enabling brands, marketers, and budget owners to quickly analyze their Reddit footprint and determine how, where, and with whom to engage in the Reddit community. The Content You Love, Now Easier to Find Reddit is home to the most engaging and authentic conversations online with more than 2.5 million comments per day across 138,000 active communities. Now, Bing is making it easier than ever to surface that content through smarter search results. As part of the Intelligent Search features launching today, Bing users will notice three key search experiences that return the most relevant content possible from Reddit’s vast community: Desktop view of Bing’s cross-platform Reddit community search experience If you type in “reddit” and the name of a Reddit community, like “aww” or “data is beautiful,” the relevant subreddits will show up in a dedicated results section. Better still, Bing will surface a sneak peak of the community with the top conversations of the day. Mobile view of Bing’s cross-platform Reddit AMA search experience If you type in the name of someone who’s done an AMA—let’s say, Dr. Jane Goodall—their past or upcoming AMAs will surface along with additional information about Jane. l. Bing will give snapshots of completed AMAs and, for users just searching for “Reddit AMAs” in general, a carousel of popular AMAs. Mobile view of Bing’s cross-platform Reddit Q&A search experience Last but certainly not least, Bing users whose queries are best answered with relevant Reddit conversations, will see those conversations at the top of the page, easily getting perspectives from millions of Reddit users. Best of all, Bing has launched their suite of Reddit-tailored results across platforms, so whether you’re on your phone wondering what the best free online certificates are that will look good on your resume or on desktop looking for a community devoted to baby elephant gifs, Bing users will have access to the most relevant Reddit content right at their fingertips. As this initial set of experiences roll out, we will work with Bing to collect feedback and continue refining and adding features as we understand how people are using this experience. Better Brand Insights from Reddit But wait: there’s more! In addition to launching an all-new consumer search experience for Reddit content on Bing, our partnership with Microsoft also leverages our relationship with Socialgist to bring Reddit’s data and API to Power BI, a comprehensive set of business modules that utilizes Microsoft’s AI and analytics to help brands and marketers analyze data and share insights. As we developed our partnership with Microsoft, we found that Power BI offered incredibly robust, and easy-to-consume business intelligence tools to turn Reddit data into clear, useful insights. Power BI’s data analysis offers flexibility to customize and even build your own modules. It also enables dynamic querying, which allows users to easily re-run and change queries in real time and customize data visualizations through multiple variables. With the general availability of the Power BI solution templates suite for brand management and targeting on Reddit, brands and marketers can now monitor, target, and compare their Reddit footprint across communities in a flexible, convenient format. Brands can use this solution to see which communities are talking about them the most, uncover the sentiment of those conversations, and receive detailed breakdowns of their mentions and sentiment over time. Learn more about the Power BI Solution Templates here. We hope today’s announcement is just the first step in exploring the opportunities to bring relevant content, communities, and insights from our users to brands and consumers alike.

In a political climate where talk of bots and astroturfing has sometimes caused skepticism when it comes to online activism, we wanted to look into the pro-net neutrality activity on the site to make sure that Reddit wasn’t being gamed by outside actors looking to manipulate our platform. The results of this analysis were so overwhelming that we wanted to share them with the public on this day of action in support of net neutrality. Not only did we find the activity to be an authentic, truly grassroots phenomenon, but it represented some of the most fervent organic activity we have ever seen on the front page in all of Reddit’s twelve year history. The bottom line is that real people—millions of them—care about preserving the free and open internet, and they are taking to Reddit to express themselves. Whether through telling us their personal stories or by raising an upvote for the members of Congress who refused to sell out their interests, redditors are making themselves heard on this issue. It is up to all of those in Washington who represent us to listen. The Analysis On November 21st, the front page of Reddit was covered with posts linking to Battle For The Net and warning about FCC Chairman Pai’s planned vote to end net neutrality on December 14th. On December 1st, shortly after the admins at Reddit HQ gave Snoo a net neutrality makeover and posted a series of pro-net neutrality banner ads, another round of net neutrality posts from the community hit the front page. This time, they focused on campaign donation amounts that congressional representatives had received from telecom companies (most of these amounts came from this March article in The Verge). Reddit users care about net neutrality, and the organic voting patterns we observed around these events showed it. Prominent national and international events often result in several links and self-posts on the front page. For comparison, at their peak, voting on Super Bowl and McGregor-Mayweather posts this year represented ~20% of front page votes. At the peak of these two net neutrality events, over 70% of front page votes went to net neutrality posts! Timeline: Battle For The Net In the morning hours (UTC) of Nov. 20th, a few Battle For The Net posts were submitted with limited success. Later that evening, the first post to hit the front page was submitted, taking 6 hours to climb there. Subsequently, the morning (UTC) of Nov. 21st saw several Battle For The Net posts submitted, with a few posts hitting the front page after 4 hours. By 3am UTC, Battle For The Net voting hit its peak, 34 hours after the first front page-reaching post was submitted. All voting patterns around this activity registered as organic according to the factors we constantly monitor to help us surface and neutralize spam and bot efforts. Timeline: “This is my representative…” The first “This is my representative…” post was submitted in the early morning hours (UTC) of Dec. 1st, with a crosspost hitting the front page 4.5 hours later. After a few hours of “This is my representative…” posts being met with limited success, the momentum started to build with multiple posts submitted around noon UTC, hitting the front page within an hour. By 5pm UTC, “This is my representative…” hit its peak, 13 hours after the first front page post was submitted. As with previous net neutrality activism on the site, this activity registered as authentic. For example, the geo data from the early voting on these posts came primarily from the home states of these representatives before hitting the front page and reaching a wider audience. After the dust settled, thousands of posts and tens of thousands of comments related to Chairman Pai’s plan to gut net neutrality had been created. Tens of millions of users were informed of the threat, and millions of Reddit voters showed their support. In the end, hundreds of posts on the topic, coming from hundreds of diverse subreddits, hit Reddit’s front page. Yet, despite the intense concern that the Reddit community demonstrated, in true Reddit form, positivity and good-natured irreverence won the day. Of the “This is my representative…” posts, the top karma-winning representatives were: Runner-Up: Bernie Sanders not selling out Winner: Senator Dog! What You Can Do The FCC’s vote on net neutrality is scheduled for this Thursday, December 14th. There is still time to tell them why they should reconsider. Go here to share your story of how the repeal of net neutrality rules would personally affect you. And go to battleforthenet.com to tell your member of Congress why he or she should call on Chairman Pai to reconsider his plan."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/presenting-endless-thread-a-new-podcast-partnership-from-reddit-and-wbur","date":"2017-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Presenting ‘Endless Thread’: A New Podcast Partnership from Reddit and WBUR","text":"Today, we’re very excited to announce the launch of Endless Thread, a brand new podcast bringing some of Reddit’s most compelling stories to life with well-crafted audio narratives from the podcast pros at NPR’s Boston news station, WBUR.

While we still have lots of improvements to the UI, feature set, and moderation flow still in the works, we’re excited to start by sharing a preview of two of the most important features in the redesign: a new set of community styling tools and an easier way for users to post to their favorite communities. The End of “Dystopian Craigslist” But first, here’s a quick recap of why we’re redesigning our desktop site to begin with. As Steve put it in his AMA back in January, “The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago.” Recently, he summed it up a bit more bluntly: “Reddit grows primarily through word of mouth. Many of us evangelize Reddit and tell people how awesome it is, what an impact it’s made in their life, how much it makes them laugh, etc., and then when those new people decide to check out Reddit for the first time they’re greeted with dystopian Craigslist. We’d like to fix that.” This year, teams across the company—from Design and Community to Product and Engineering—have been working together to do just that, rebuilding the desktop site to be more welcoming to new users and easier for moderators while iterating based on feedback from redditors at every stage. Simpler Community Styling One of the biggest areas of improvement we’ve focused on is offering simpler community styling. Reddit has tens of thousands of communities organized around every topic imaginable, and many of these mod teams have invested a significant amount of time into creating a unique aesthetic that feels like home. For redditors unfamiliar with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), however, community customization can be difficult. With the redesign, we’ve created an all-new styling system that empowers mod teams to stylize their Reddit communities with design choices as unique as the communities themselves. If you’ve ever created your own community, you know just how difficult it can be to alter the look of it through CSS, especially if you don’t have a background in coding, so we’re working on a number of features that make the customization process easier for moderators. We still have a lot of work and testing to do before we have full feature parity and a design that we’re confident new and existing users will love; but in the meantime, here’s the preview you’ve all been waiting for, from Steve’s fireside chat at Web Summit 2017 earlier today: r/aww (card view) r/aww (classic view) r/analog (card view) r/analog (classic view) r/analog (compact view) Above is a sneak peek at what the r/aww and r/analog communities could look like in the redesign, with three different viewing options: card view (featuring already expanded image posts, for easy browsing in media-rich communities), classic view (similar to the layout of Reddit’s current listings pages), and compact view (for users who want to see the maximum number of posts per page, with the option of expanding images by clicking the media icon). Easier Posting Flow As we continue to improve our styling features, we’re also working to make other key parts of the Reddit experience more user-friendly—and versatile. One of the most central improvements we’ve made is revamping how users post to their favorite communities. With Reddit’s current design, posting can be difficult for new users to figure out. With the redesign, we want to make sure that when redditors share a photo, image, or text post with a community, it’s easy for them to see that community’s rules, add all the necessary flair and tagging, and format text posts to their liking, all within the submission page. Here’s another mock-up to show the posting flow for a redditor who wants to share an image with the r/aww community. For the sake of making this a truly “aww”-inducing mock-up, let’s say it’s an image of their adorable puppy named Banjo. If you’re more of a lurker, you might not notice a few big upgrades to the existing submission page. Here’s what’s different: simpler toggling between image or video, link, and text posts;a drop-down menu to change the community where you’re posting;a row of buttons at the bottom allowing you to add post flair, spoiler tags, and NSFW tags directly from the submission page;prominently displayed community rules; andan array of rich text options (no elaborate markdown required!). We’ll be expanding our group of volunteer testers to more moderators and users soon and sharing more previews of our designs as we continue to iterate, so stay tuned for further updates. And in case you missed it, you can watch Steve’s full fireside chat at Web Summit here. Our thanks to all of the users and moderators who have participated in testing so far for their invaluable feedback and to the r/aww and r/analog moderators for letting us test out the new structured styling on their communities."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/introducing-the-new-reddit-ads-dashboard","date":"2017-10-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Introducing the New Reddit Ads Dashboard","text":"In March, we launched a new version of the Reddit ads platform with a complete design overhaul, enhanced billing options, and improved reporting. Since then, we’ve been working on ways to upgrade the platform even further, through features that help advertisers better understand campaign performance and optimize for different campaign objectives. Today, we’re excited to announce the next major improvement to Reddit ads: our brand new ads dashboard, which we’ll be rolling out as the new default experience for our partners. Here’s a look at the new dashboard and a quick recap of other updates we’ve made to our ad products. Enhanced Reporting Advertisers on Reddit currently target audiences in a number of ways, including by interest and subreddit. And with the new Reddit ads dashboard, advertisers can now analyze campaign performance on each targeting option to determine which audience segments are driving the most reach and performance for their campaigns. Advanced reporting categories in the new Reddit ads dashboard include: Subreddit and Interest — Subreddits and Interests are the main ways advertisers target their campaigns. Now, advertisers can see how their ads are performing by each subreddit or interest they choose to target.Geography — Advertisers can use Country or Designated Market Area (DMA) to break down their performance by location.Platform — Advertisers can view campaign metrics for both web and mobile web impressions.Date — Advertisers can break down their campaign results by day. In addition to enhanced reporting functionality, Reddit’s new ads dashboard allows advertisers to view Reddit-specific engagement metrics, such as upvotes and downvotes, directly within their dashboards. Conversion Pixel We also recently released the Reddit Conversion pixel, which helps advertisers measure their campaigns by tracking and attributing a website action to an ad view. Essentially, it’s a tool to measure a campaign’s return on investment by showing conversion from an ad to an e-commerce order’s “thank you” page, a lead form success page, or a sign-up to a web app. This is the first time Reddit has implemented a tracking tool like this. With the Reddit Conversion Pixel installed, attributed conversions are counted directly in an advertiser’s dashboard. Mobile App Install Attribution For select advertisers, Reddit ads now supports mobile app attribution through integrations with partners including Tune, Adjust, and Kochava. Using an app install ad, advertisers can link an ad to their app in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store and track performance of those campaigns. In the future, we plan to roll out app install ads to all advertisers and work on more integrations with measurement partners based upon advertiser demand and feedback. What’s Next? Effectively measuring ad spend is a critical factor for advertisers considering Reddit as part of their digital advertising mix, and we’re excited to see our partners’ response to these significant improvements. While these new reporting and tracking features will offer an unprecedented level of insight into each Reddit campaign’s performance, we’re committed to collecting advertiser feedback, implementing new tracking and measurement features, and finding better ways to measure the value of the many unique brand engagements that Reddit enables."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/halloween-highlights-stranger-pairs-hallo-memes-and-the-jack-of-all-jack-o-lanterns","date":"2017-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Halloween Highlights: Stranger Pairs, Hallo-memes, and the Jack of All Jack-o’-Lanterns","text":"Redditors have always loved Halloween, since the site’s very first one back in 2005, when our alien mascot Snoo donned a pirate cap and returned the next day with a belly full of sugary loot.

How would you describe what you do at Reddit? I manage three teams: Growth, Voices, and Conversations. Growth is focused on user retention, user growth, and increasing engagement.Voices is the team that empowers content creators and on Reddit.Conversations is tasked with enabling users to have real-time dialogues in a safe manner. And outside of Reddit? These days most of time is spent with my almost 2 year old daughter. But I do enjoy hiking, bollywood movies and binge watching shows. I probably have watched all seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond 8-10 times. Do you have a favorite community on the site? It’s hard to choose.

What’s one thing about Reddit that you didn’t know before working here? I was amazed by the breadth of content on Reddit. It can be anywhere from a silly meme to a subreddit where people are forming support communities to get through a difficult time in their lives. What are some of the biggest challenges your team is tackling right now? Reddit is currently run on the same platform it was built on over 10 years ago. There a lot of problems we’re trying solve at Reddit, which range from improving the onboarding experience to fixing our analytics pipeline. Here at Reddit, one of our core value is act like a owner. If you see a problem, fix it! A lot of Reddit’s core value is in the comments, so we are working on making the discovery of those comments easier. We are also working on making it easier for people to overview their contributions to Reddit overtime, and if you like a redditor, we want you to be able to discover more of their content easily. Ultimately, the biggest challenge for Reddit is getting through the learning curve. We are trying to improve the onboarding experience to make it a little easier for new users to discover content.

There inevitably comes a day in every CTO’s life when you discover the juniorest of juniors you hired “a while ago” (the whiles get shorter as you get older) has not only stopped performing spontaneous (unplanned) production “load tests,” but has become the leader of a new eng team with juniors of their own to mentor. It’s in that spirit that I’m very pleased to announce the first ever fully fledged (and paid!) internship program for software-engineers-in-training, coming to Reddit HQ in summer 2018! Why now? Redditors have been asking us to have internships for years, but we wanted to make sure that when we hire juniors (whether pre- or post-grad), we set them up for success. This means not just giving them a job but also a way to progress in their career. As a company, we know we can provide access to mentorship from world-class engineers with lots of experience in scaling. Implicit in the “access” is that they need to be “accessible.” We are finally big enough and have enough basic infrastructure and good processes to make sure we can build product, mentor juniors, and keep the site up. We also have an increasingly large list of hard but interesting projects to work on, which are also relatively well-defined. This means we have work for engineers of all experience levels, and the work will be interesting and necessary. In planning this move, we realized that we’d also like to not just hire an intern, but rather a bona fide intern class. This ups the work for us, and the number of people committed to the endeavor, but also means a chance for an honest-to-goodness internship program complete with trust falls (we assume this is a necessary ingredient of mixing “HR” with “bootcamp,” and if we’re wrong, we’ll have a batch of interns to test these ideas out on!). Who are we looking for? So with all that to motivate why we’re doing this, let’s move onto the how. If you satisfy the following criteria… A desire to work at Reddit HQ in San Francisco over Summer 2018Are actively working towards a degree in CS, EE, or a related fieldAre able to program your way out of a paper bag…or make a paper bag out of CSS3…or something probably involving React because that’s all anyone talks about anymoreAbility to fetch coffee… for yourself!

But while your upvotes and downvotes play an important role in deciding what ends up on the front page, it’s critical that redditors who are US citizens also cast their votes IRL at the ballot box. Too many Americans miss out on this fundamental right because they are not registered to vote, or their registration is out of date. Studies show that 40% of Americans are unaware they need to update their voter registration when they move—something 35 million Americans will do this year alone. Others don’t realize that registration must also be filed or updated after major life events, such as turning 18 or after legally changing one’s name. To help address this knowledge gap and ensure broad participation in our democratic process, Reddit has partnered with National Voter Registration Day, a non-partisan, non-profit effort to encourage Americans to register to vote. Today, September 26th, redditors will see ads around the site, as well as sticked posts in selected non-partisan subreddits, encouraging them to register and learn about the importance of voting in local elections, not just big-time federal races like the presidency and Congress. From the departments that oversee the water we drink and the school boards that teach our children to the sheriffs and judges who enforce and interpret our laws, the offices and issues decided by local elections affect our daily lives. Yet only 1-in-5 eligible voters turn out for them. We can change this. Go to nationalvoterregistrationday.org to learn more about registration processes and deadlines in your area. Election Day this year is November 7, but local registration deadlines may be much sooner.

We continue to get a lot of questions from redditors and job applicants alike asking who exactly makes up the team behind the front page of the internet, so we’re kicking off a new series called “Snoo Spotlights,” starting with Rohaina (better known as u/khaleesi on Reddit) from our Los Angeles Sales team. Q: What’s a typical day in the life of Rohaina Hassan? My role sits in the middle of the advocating for our users, partners, and internal teams. A typical day involves expectation setting, updates, and finding solutions amongst various internal and external teams to keep our Advertising partnerships and campaigns running smoothly. You’ll see a variety of meetings on my calendar, from brainstorm sessions to kick-off calls with clients to interviews with candidates. Most days are sprinkled with spontaneous coffee/pastry runs with people from different teams or finding new ways to troll people on my team. The company is in growth mode, so if I’m walking around the office I’ll also try to make sure I meet new folks and make them feel welcome. Q: And outside of work? I do a few things! I help produce a podcast hosted by two of my friends. It’s called Black Girl Book Club, and on each episode Lauren and Jordan talk about books they’ve read that were written by women of color. (Check it out if you’re curious!) I’m also working on a zine as part of the Undertone Collective, and I host a radio show that highlights artist of colors, with an emphasis on South Asian musicians. Aside from that, you can usually find me scoping out food spots, watching waaaay too much TV, trying to knock off cities on my list, running around with my camera, or volunteering with local organizations. Q: What’s one thing you didn’t know about Reddit that you learned after joining? The depth of our communities. I knew how many we had and the volume of interactions and the substantive quality of those interactions, but I didn’t truly know until I joined the team. I’ve discovered so many obscure subreddits and interesting users’ stories. I’m lucky my role entails knowing about our communities, because I have an excuse for all the perusing I do! Q: What are you most excited about working on right now? Well, I just moved down to the LA office, so I think a bunch of us on the Sales team are excited to get that up and running. We’ve got some really cool upcoming campaigns with some of our TV & Film partners, so keep an eye out for those. On a technical side, our Ads Engineering and Product teams are incredible, and working on some really exciting projects that will definitely be pivotal for the business. Q: What are some of your favorite communities on Reddit? r/wholesomememesr/womensstreetwearr/asktrollxr/accidentalwesandersonr/brownbeautyr/abcdesisr/karmacourtr/analog Q: Do you have a favorite post of all time? Well, this is a really hard question. I can’t choose one, so I’m going to list a few of my favorite ones. There’s a mix of them, so here goes: The saga of Jerry and Nigel, a dynamic sock duo’s coming-of-ageThat one time we had a Travel Ban, but some Reddit lawyers were there to save the dayOh man, I’m toast.When websites were getting blocked during the Egyptian Revolution and people came to Reddit for information, gather more resources, and spread the word Q: What advice would you give to someone looking to join Reddit’s Sales team? Embrace yourself, be ready to grind, ask questions, think critically, and always remember the human. Also, while you don’t necessarily need to be a redditor, I would make sure you’re genuinely interested in the Reddit story and mission. Interested in joining our growing Sales team?

A common question we get from newbie engineering team members here at Reddit is “When are we going to fix search?” Until this year, the answer was always “Go ask the search team on the 5th floor.” Which was great fun because a) the elevator button to the 5th floor didn’t work and b) there was no search team. But the times, they are a-changin’. We’re happy to announce that we’re launching a new search engine at Reddit. Actually, it’s been launched to 50% of traffic for the past couple weeks and has already served up nearly half a billion queries. Now that we’re confident in our system, we’re pushing it to 100% of traffic. We hope you enjoy faster and more reliable results! More importantly, we’ve also started an entire product unit dedicated to search and relevance here at Reddit, led by our Director of Engineering Luis. We recognize that these technologies are critical to Reddit’s future. Our platform contains one of the world’s most interesting collections of content, currently indexing over a quarter billion posts for search, and it gets bigger every day. But we know this content is hard to find. Improving search and relevance will allow Reddit to sift through millions of posts, comments, and communities to create a custom-fit stream of great content straight to your home feed. That’s the future. For now, we thought it’d be fun to take a trip down memory lane. A Brief History of Reddit Search Needless to say, search is not an easy challenge to solve. We’ve been on a bit of a roller coaster when it comes to search at Reddit, but now that we’re on our sixth search stack, we’re no strangers to the struggles of doing search at scale. Below is a rough outline of the 12-year history, along with a few select quotes from the team as we’ve iterated to scale our infra to Reddit’s needs: 2005 – Steve Huffman (u/spez), co-founder and now CEO, turns on postgres 7.4’s contrib/tsearch2. This was a simpler time, when the statement “Oh, we can just have Postgres do it!” was greeted with “Sounds good to me! What can’t Postgres do!?” We also really liked TRIGGERs back then (“No, it’s cool. The database does all the work and it’s guaranteed to be accurate” is something we no doubt said). It worked well, but it wasn’t very tunable, and we quickly discovered we were bogging down the majority of Postgres queries with a small minority (~2%) of search traffic:“We fixed a bug in the search results ordering.” —Steve“We updated the search system this morning to help alleviate some load problems.” —Steve“Jeremy is working on search! It’s not a complicated fix (basically, the sorting is whacky).” —Steve 2007 – Chris Slowe (u/KeyserSosa), founding engineer (and now CTO), re-implements with PyLucene. This was actually implemented just over 10 years ago in July 2007. It consisted of a single Python process which was set up as a threaded RPC server over TCP. In the initial version, we had actually supported searching for both post titles and comments, and the Lucene index files were comfortably stored on a single box. This was also before we moved to AWS, and at the time we had seriously considered getting a Google Search Appliance, which would have made a nice addition to our single rack. This version was flexible, but we didn’t set it up in a way to make it easily scalable:“Search works much better, tagging and user-controlled subreddits are right around the corner” —Steve“Search is better, but not quite where we’d like it.” —Steve“Stats and search are temporarily disabled, but will be coming back as soon as we can get them repaired.” —Steve“We were hoping to include an upgraded search, which, unlike the last version, was actually useful and helped you find what you were looking for. Unfortunately, the version we settled on didn’t quite load test as nicely” —Steve“I made a quick fix to search that I hope helps until we get a chance to really fix it.” —Steve 2008 – David King (u/ketralnis), third employee and now search engineer, implements Solr. In fact, he implemented a home-built pysolr, which was capable of shipping update documents to Solr in XML and wrapping the response in such a way as to emulate our existing Query models enough to drop it into any sort or listing. It was actually pretty sweet. The initial version didn’t support comments, but that did come later.“[David]’s been fixing search and hacking mystery projects in Erlang.” —Alexis Ohanian“I’ve totally replaced the reddit search function.” —David King 2010 – David replaces Solr with IndexTank, a third-party search provider. When you love something, outsource it… said no one ever. As the site continued to grow and we first cracked a billion pageviews in a month with an engineering team of four, we put all of our effort into 503 mitigation, continuing to add Postgres read slaves, adding more cache, starting to take advantage of a very early version of Cassandra (which was followed shortly thereafter by a memorable 24-hour, thundering-herd-related outage), and generally ignoring how bad search was getting. We had an intrepid startup approach us and offer to take search off of our hands forever for less than we were paying to keep Solr running, so we signed on!“We launched a new search engine yesterday. Calm down. It’s okay. I know. You’ve been hurt before.” —David King 2012 – Keith Mitchell (u/kemitche) implements CloudSearch after LinkedIn shut down IndexTank. Clearly, it was one of the shorter forevers, but IndexTank served us well until the company was acquired. When we found out they were shutting down, we had to ween off of IndexTank and make a quick transition to AWS CloudSearch. Continuing our long-standing tradition of ‘Let the new guy take care of it,’ that task fell to Keith, and over the next several years we scaled and stretched CloudSearch to bursting:“Today we moved from the old Amazon CloudSearch domain to a new Amazon CloudSearch domain. The old search domain had significant performance issues: roughly 33% of queries took over 5 seconds to complete and would result in the search error page.” —u/bsimpson TODAY – Lucidworks Fusion! This time around, we wanted to ensure that search would meet three criteria: it needed to be fast, it needed to scale well with Reddit’s growth, and most importantly, it needed to be relevant. Ultimately, this led us to partner with the search experts at Lucidworks, leveraging Fusion and their unique search expertise from a team comprised of multiple Solr committers. Below, we’ll explain how we went about this in more detail.“As /u/bitofsalt mentioned a few months ago, we’ve been working on some improvements to search. We may even be ahead of spez’s 10 year plan.” —u/starfishjenga Once More with Feeling Earlier this year, search on Reddit had become truly abysmal. Simple queries could be expected to succeed only half of the time. Want to search with two keywords? Get out of here! Fig. 1: Example error page when our CloudSearch cluster is under heavy load. After looking at several options, we partnered with with Lucidworks to revitalize Reddit’s search system. Lucidworks is the creator of Fusion, a Solr-based search stack that supports huge document scale and high query throughput. First Things First: Ingesting at Reddit Scale The biggest challenge in moving to a new search system was that our indexing pipeline needed to be updated. The first attempt was a bit of a beast. In the interest of speed, we hastily put it together on our legacy ETL system comprised of Jenkins and Azkaban orchestrating numerous Hive queries. As you can see in the diagram below, pulling together data from several sources into one cohesive canonical view to be indexed proved to be more complex than originally expected. Fig. 2: First iteration at our new search ingestion pipeline, now replaced with a significantly simplified version. Our second attempt was both simpler and produced significantly better results. We managed to trim the entire pipeline to just four simpler and more accurate Hive queries, which led to a 33% increase in posts indexed. Another great improvement is that we not only index new post creations but also update their relevance signals in real time as votes, comments, and other signals flow in throughout the day. Make it Relevant Search results don’t mean much if they’re not relevant. For our initial rollout the primary goal was to avoid degrading the overall relevance of results returned. To monitor this, we measured clicks on the search results page and compared the rank of results being clicked across old and new search systems. A perfect search engine would yield 100% of clicks on the top result being returned, which is another way of saying you want the most relevant result at the top. Since we know a perfect search engine isn’t an achievable goal, we use measures like Mean Reciprocal Rank and Discounted Cumulative Gain to compare the quality of our results. While it’s still early in our experiments, the data so far points towards very comparable relevancy measurements between our old vs. new stacks, with Fusion having a slight edge. The promising part of this is that we haven’t done much relevancy tuning yet — something that our new system actually supports. Advancements like personalization, machine learning models, and query intent and rewriting are now low-hanging fruit. Fig. 3: Comparison of search result click positions between Fusion and CloudSearch stacks. The Rollout As we overcame the data ingestion challenges and monitored relevance, we continued to ramp up usage to more and more redditors. The feedback from this early group was invaluable, and we owe the community a huge thank-you in helping us surface bugs and less common use cases. We started out with just 1% of users on the new stack, working through issues reported and improving the ingestion pipeline as we increased rollout percentages to 5, 10, 25 and ultimately 50% of traffic prior to GA. Throughout this time, we sent all search queries as dark traffic to our new search cluster to ensure it would be ready for full scale as we increased rollout percentages. Fig. 4: CloudSearch Errors in yellow and Fusion in green. We’re proud to say that Reddit Search is better than ever! A full reindex of all Reddit content now completes in about 5 hours (down from around 11 hours), and we’re constantly streaming live updates to the index. The error rate is down by two orders of magnitude with 99% of search results served in under 500ms. The number of machines needed to run search dropped from ~200 earlier this year down to ~30 so we even managed to get some cost savings. Fig. 5: Overview of Reddit’s new search stack. Faster, more reliable, more relevant, and lower cost! Certainly this shall be the last time we ever need to change our search stack! The Future In all seriousness, we think you’ll love this update. It’s our hope that the new search stack will be a foundation for improvements that make it easier to discover all the great content on Reddit. More importantly: we’re not done. Fixing search is just the first step in a series of new capabilities that will make Reddit feel more personalized and relevant to your interests.

On Reddit’s beginnings Guy: “You wanted to name it Reddit?”Alexis: “We couldn’t afford the name Snoo which is the name we wanted… the idea was people would ask, ‘Oh, what’s Snoo?’ and we’d say, ‘Exactly! It’s what’s new online.”Steve: “Instead, Alexis thought people would say, ‘What’s Reddit?’”Alexis: “I hoped people would say, ‘I read it on Reddit.’ Unfortunately, ‘Snoo.com’ cost $4000, which we didn’t have, and was a third of our funding. So, couldn’t afford it. Named the mascot Snoo instead, and then Reddit was available and was totally free. R-E-D-D-I-T. So that and the mascot were my key contributions.” On growing the community Guy: “Did you have a sense of how you were going to make it sustainable?” Steve: “Not really. We weren’t really thinking in those terms, to be honest… We didn’t even really think of ourselves as a business. This was more of an adventure we were on… Once we had real users, it became ‘Let’s just not let the users down.’ And that was our mentality for quite a while.” Steve: “Alexis and I were submitting all the content, and we had a rule back then that all of the content on the front page had to be less than 24 hours old. So sometimes we’d go to the site and it would just be white space. I had taken a day off for whatever reason, and in the late afternoon I remember thinking ‘Shoot, I haven’t thought about Reddit all day long’ and that the front page must be completely empty … and when I checked it was full of content from usernames that I had never seen before. That was the day when we realized this was a thing—these are real users. We’re not just propping it up with our fake accounts anymore. That was a really special day. I still get excited when I think about it because that’s when our motivation changed. That’s when Reddit was really born, I think.” A packed house at Yerba Buena Center. (Photo: Jim McAuley) On how their relationship has evolved over the years Alexis: “We never really exercised the muscles that founders have to exercise, that best friends don’t … It’s great to be able to start a company with one of your best friends, but the conversations you have to have as co-founders are very different than the conversations you have to have as friends, and we didn’t have enough of the hard ones often enough and it was just unresolved and festered.” Guy: “The two of you went to therapy together?” Steve: “We did.” Alexis: “When Steve pitched me on it he said, ‘Look, my therapist has a really good idea, let’s come together, and I was like ‘Sure, okay.’” Alexis, Guy Raz, Steve, and Steve’s awesome sweater, backstage at the Yerba Buena Center. (Photo: Jim McAuley) On what makes Reddit the most human place on the internet Steve: “What we want Reddit to be is, in many ways, a reflection of humanity. Humanity is not perfect, but what you get on Reddit is an authentic representation of what’s going on in the world, and we believe that is very, very powerful.” Steve: “One of the things that Reddit has taught me is that people are fundamentally good. People in large numbers want to help each other. When you put people together in the right context, they will do really incredible things. There’s no reason why that needs to be undermined by a bunch of assholes. It doesn’t mean assholes don’t exist, but we can make the conversation more balanced and that’s really been our focus ” Alexis: “Consider 300 million people will visit Reddit this month. That’s almost as big as the population of the United States. The vast, vast majority of those interactions and engagements are never reported by another user and are either benign or actually good. If anything, it shows us how much more we have in common with each other than apart, because when you’re on r/skincareaddiction you don’t know anything else about the hundreds of thousands of other people talking about their acne scars other than the fact that you have the shared issue.” Alexis: “Whether it’s about that, or putting arms on birds—r/birdswitharms—you find out that you’re weirdly not the only one who wants to put The Rock’s arms on a parakeet, and that’s okay because all people of all creeds should be able to come together and put Dwayne Johnson’s arms on a parakeet. Do you not agree?” Guy: “I agree, yeah” Alexis: “Would someone on r/birdswitharms put Guy’s arms on a bird? You’re welcome. Someone here is going to do it.

A few months later, a small group of redditors were selling print copies of a real, professionally stylized, monthly magazine—with designers, an editorial staff, and their very own post on the Reddit Blog. We love a good story of redditors collaborating on creative projects—whether it’s an international team of hyperloop enthusiasts or a supergroup of gif-makers—so we caught up with the creator of Meme Insider and a few members of their executive team to find out how it all came together and what’s in store for the future of this redditor-made magazine. “Shitposting gone too far” The story of Meme Insider begins with a user named Alex, who goes by u/DigitalizedOrange on Reddit. “Before Meme Insider, I wasn’t very active on Reddit,” Alex writes. “I mostly viewed the default subreddits and rarely gave any input.” There was one less common subreddit where he liked to lurk, however: r/MemeEconomy, a relatively new community on Reddit that bills itself as “a place where individuals can buy, sell, share, make, and invest in memes freely.” On a given day, typical posts in r/MemeEconomy may include encouragements to “buy” new memes that are starting to become popular in other subreddits, requests for “appraisals” of meme formats that have an uncertain future, and alerts when a meme has become “normified.” While the language of the subreddit may have a learning curve, the underlying premise is simple: memes are a fickle business with ups and downs that users can track just like a stock market. Alex’s first post to r/MemeEconomy took a slightly different approach. Instead of sharing his commentary on one particular meme format, he imagined a more comprehensive approach to meme analysis. “I had nothing to do one night, so I decided I would make a joke magazine cover for r/MemeEconomy,” he says. “I had no idea the post would actually go anywhere.” Despite the fact that this was u/DigitalizedOrange’s first post on Reddit and the first post of its kind on r/MemeEconomy, the response was overwhelmingly positive, earning over 6,000 upvotes and several requests for him to create an actual, full-fledged magazine. Escalating the idea of making a “real” magazine, other users in the comments volunteered to contribute freelance articles, design help, and even advertisements. By the end of the day, Alex resolved to develop the cover into an experimental pilot issue of Meme Insider, with a small group of volunteer redditors. “When the post started gaining traction and I realized I could turn this into an actual magazine,” he recalls, “I gathered some people who were interested and put together the ‘.5’ issue for Meme Insider, which was basically a test to see if people would actually read a magazine about memes.” After a few weeks of work, Alex released what they’d come up with: a 25-page digital magazine with a cover story aptly titled “Shitposting Gone Too Far.” Redditors who scanned through the test issue of Meme Insider found a surprisingly professional debut, with original interviews, quantitative and qualitative analyses of popular memes featuring Spongebob and Kermit the Frog, and an early discussion of NASDANQ, the nascent meme-trading site run by a number of redditors in r/MemeEconomy. While the medium and content may have seemed at odds—a monthly magazine tracking memes, which change from minute to minute—Alex explains the editorial philosophy he took from the start of Meme Insider. “We try to focus on overarching trends and big events rather than a listicle of the ‘Top 10 Memes of the Month’ sort of thing. Trying to be too topical is the best way to ensure that you end up falling behind the times.” Thus, retrospective analyses took precedence over tips on new memes that could have become dated by the time the issue was released. While the conception of the magazine may have been in jest, the content throughout is quite earnest, as the issue’s introductory letter from the Meme Insider staff makes clear: “This magazine is the culmination of a group of strangers on the internet that took a joke too far and ended up here.” BUY! BUY! BUY! After the inaugural “0.5” issue received a similarly warm response from its core fanbase of meme economists, the volunteer staff grew and began turning their “joke too far” into a well-organized editorial force with interviews of more public figures, an improved design, and their very first advertisements (albeit fake ones). “r/MemeEconomy is full of people who love the same things as we do, so finding Meme Insider team members was pretty easy,” Alex explains. “With the help of the amazing r/MemeEconomy staff members, we stickied a call for applications which received tons of support. “The staff over at Meme Insider are the sole reason we are still running. Without them, no issue would ever get finished and we wouldn’t be here right now. I can’t thank them enough!” Despite working across time zones and busy schedules—coordinating on Slack, e-mail, and Reddit in their free time—the volunteer staff has leveled up the scope of Meme Insider with each issue. In January, they interviewed red-sweatered redditor and 2016 Presidential Election meme Ken Bone and ran their first ad for another Reddit community, fellow meme subreddit r/WholesomeMemes. In February, they launched a Patreon page and received their first major press shoutout from Motherboard. In March, they interviewed popular vlogger Anthony Fantano, creator of The Needle Drop, and released the first print issues of Meme Insider. Their team at the time, now 39 strong, included lead designer u/CartoonWarp, executive marketer u/Noerdy (one of the original mods of r/MemeEconomy and r/WholesomeMemes), and an impressive list of developers, designers, marketers, and writers. “Other than really small details here and there, everyone seems to be on the same page when it comes to what direction the magazine should take,” Alex says. “I think that stems from the fact that our whole team was browsing and following the Meme Economy independently before coming together as a group. We all seem to get it.” The staff also has to be comfortable with a certain amount of uncertainty regarding what the next issue will bring. Volunteers, many of whom are occupied with school and full-time jobs, come and go, as do the memes they write about. “The only trend we see month to month is the lack of a single identifiable trend,” Alex writes. “That’s the great thing about memes. You never know where the next big one will come from. It’s why you need people like us tracking this stuff.” As Meme Insider continues to grow its number of patrons, readers, and contributors, the core staff still has ambitious goals for the future of their magazine—including a podcast, video pieces, and maybe one day “real ads.” In the meantime, you can check out their Patreon for print copies of the magazine, their website for digital copies of all past issues, and this form if you’d like to contribute to the next issue.

That’s why we’re excited to announce the extended rollout of Reddit video beta, which makes it easier than ever for redditors to capture, upload, and share videos and gifs with all their favorite communities. This launch is a giant step forward in our efforts to bring rich content to Reddit, following last year’s release of native image hosting and our introduction of native video ads earlier this year. So what is Reddit video hosting? Here’s everything you need to know: You can record video within the official Reddit apps or select a pre-recorded video from your gallery and upload it to Reddit.On desktop, you can select a video from your files to upload.Allowed video file types are MP4 and MOV, with a maximum length of 15 minutes.You can convert uploaded videos into MP4 gifs with our native gif converter.On the mobile apps, you can trim uploaded videos and gifs to just the section you want to feature.Best of all, you can watch Reddit video while you read comments and engage in conversation. (Check it out by clicking this post and scrolling down.) Why Native Video? If you’ve spent any time on r/HighQualityGifs, r/mealtimevideos, or just about any other Reddit community, you know that videos and gifs represent a major proportion of the content shared on our site. But prior to this launch, content creators had to go through a time-consuming, circuitous process to post videos, using third-party hosting platforms, copying URLs, and sharing them as link posts. This inhibited many users, especially those who capture videos on their phones and want to share them quickly with their favorite subreddits. With native video, we’ve streamlined this process dramatically, allowing both content creators and commenters to focus on the conversation taking place on Reddit. No third-party uploads, new tabs, or back arrows necessary. Beta Tests and User Feedback Of course, given Reddit’s scale, implementing video hosting that could support our vast and varied userbase was a massive undertaking. We also wanted to ensure that video would be available to redditors across all our platforms, so we worked to launch hosting on iOS, Android, and desktop at the same time. And to ensure we’re offering our users a best-in-class experience, it was important to roll this out slowly, soliciting feedback from individual redditors, video and gif communities, mod teams, and content creators along the way. As we began beta testing, we found that the most engaging types of video weren’t coming from popular users trying to establish their individual brands, as you might see on other platforms. Instead, our video adopters so far have been creating and sharing videos to engage within their specific Reddit communities, as an organic extension of conversations already happening on each subreddit. These users don’t need to worry about building a huge subscriber base or posting to an abyss of content because they’re posting directly to the communities that share their passion. Redditors who attended Tesla’s Model 3 launch posted videos of the car’s new features to r/teslamotors: And of course the pet lovers have already taken to Reddit video to share their adorable doggos with communities like r/aww: Throughout the beta process, we’ve found that native video doesn’t merely improve the content creating process; it offers a unique new format for expression and interruption-free engagement once the post is live. Because our video platform keeps a small preview window open at the top of the screen as you browse the comments below, you can transition seamlessly between viewing, lurking, and commenting on Reddit videos. It’s already proving its value to our communities, content creators, publishing partners, and brands, who are eager to start using native video to engage in conversation with Reddit communities in new ways. Your First Reddit Video We will continue to evolve Reddit video as we collect additional feedback from our users, so you can expect more updates in the coming months. In the meantime, if you’d like to try out your first video or gif post, here’s a step-by-step guide to uploading: Desktop: Click “Submit Link” on a Reddit video-enabled subredditClick “Choose File”Select an MP4 or MOV video file to uploadChoose a thumbnail for your videoAdd a titleClick “Submit” Mobile Apps: Click “Post something interesting” at the top of your “Home” feedOr, on a Reddit video-enabled subreddit, click “Post to r/___”Select “Image/Video”Click “Camera” to record a new video or “Library” to select one you’ve already recordedAdd a titleClick “Post” to submit (Startled cats, sneezing seals, and doggo eye-bleach not included.)

Long ago in an office a short distance away, our valiant eng team began a new tradition at Reddit: every two weeks, engineers across the company would have the opportunity to work on passion projects that had (almost) nothing to do with their day-to-day work. In the years since its inception, this recurring hackathon—dubbed “Snoo’s Day” after our alien mascot Snoo—has switched from biweekly to two days per quarter, expanded to all teams at Reddit, and launched an impressive number of employee-led projects that have made a significant impact on our platform, our workflow, and our offices. Here’s how it works: Each quarter, we block off a two-day period during which Reddit employees can use to spend on a project of their choice. It’s not just for PM and engineering, everyone can participate! This allows us to innovate using our collective strengths and permits more broad ideas that require more than just engineering skills. There are no official limits on what types of projects we can work on, but we encourage ideas that: Make us better at what we do. We can only get better by doing something harder than we’re used to, trying new things, and making mistakes. Expand our horizons. Are you a backend junkie that wants to learn JavaScript? A designer that wants to dabble in AI? A lawyer that wants to read Old High Saxon? Improve the product. Sometimes things can languish because they aren’t in the immediate product plan or because an idea just hasn’t been proven out. Take a big risk. Sometimes the best ideas come from building the wrong thing first. So build lots of wrong things! Hyperlapse, Amazon Prime, and Gmail all came from Snoo’s Day-esque adventures. Snoo’s Day wraps up with a company-wide celebration of projects and the presentation of awards. The awards include toughest technical challenge (The Marty), innovation (Product’s Pick), crowd favorite (People’s Choice), and founder’s favorite (The Spez Given). Our Favorite July 2017 Projects At the most recent Snoo’s Day in July, more than 20 project ideas were presented. Here are a few of our favorites, as described by their creators in their own words. Reddit AMP PagesGoogle + Reddit Team! Life Pro Tip: If you put your thumbs and index fingers together and close the rest of your fingers into fists, it forms an upvote. This Snoo’s Day included a very special project which saw Reddit and Google combining forces to hack on our AMP site. AMP, for the uninitiated, is an approach taken by Google and others to support fast content pages for mobile browsers. It’s a subset of HTML and a set of approved components that avoid dancing layout issues, slow-loading text content, bloated JavaScript, etc. Along with the AMP cache that Google hosts, mobile users get super fast content pages from search results and elsewhere. Right now Reddit exposes basic AMP pages for all of our self post comments pages, but there’s a lot of room to grow. As a result of this project you’ll soon see millions more fast-loading posts via AMP (including photo and video posts). We’re also better positioned to bring core Reddit features to our AMP site and have helped push what’s achievable via AMP.Reddit + ARKitAndrew Rohn (/u/andrewrohn) It’s Augmented Reality right in the Reddit iOS app! I’m convinced that AR is a serious source of innovation in the near future, so I wanted to build an update to our app that would allow users to bond over and creatively share AR experiences. Working with Apple’s ARKit, I built an AR interface that would allow users to place an upvote in the virtual world and show a banana for scale for when you forget your banana at home. While we’re not adding AR to the app just yet, I found that Apple’s ARKit was delightful to work with, and I’m excited to see it improve even more. Reddit Today (Winner: The Spez Given)u/dcaredd This Reddit iOS app extension is a simple iOS Today Extension that displays the top posts in r/popular in your Notification Center. It allows you to see what’s trending at a quick glance without launching the app. To drill down, you just have to tap on a post to navigate to that post in the app. Today Extensions are a common part of the iOS experience, and Reddit’s content seemed a good fit for this type of interaction. Creating this project gave me insight into the Reddit app architecture and how it could be improved. Accurate Traffic Pages (Winner: The Marty)Krishnan Chandra (u/shrink_and_an_arch) We set out to fix the data on Reddit’s traffic pages, which have been showing desktop-only data for a long time now. They also rely on an antiquated data collection and processing system which is not used much anymore. We wanted these pages to include mobile traffic and give moderators a more accurate view into the popularity of their subreddits. Mobile traffic is a surprisingly large percentage of Reddit’s usage! It was shocking to see the magnitude of the difference caused by adding mobile traffic into the calculations. (Note: This project was released.) Snoois (Winner: The Spez Given)Zean Tsoi (u/zeantsoi) Snoois is a Slack slash command that enables employees to instantly and effortlessly search for key info and related usernames of fellow employees. It puts the company directory (and more) at your fingertips. As the company expands, keeping tabs on which usernames belong to what employee has become tedious and inconvenient. Slack’s ubiquity makes it the perfect platform to implement an employee lookup tool, thereby benefitting workflow, efficiency, and communication. Getting a Snoo’s Day project into production is a microcosm of what it takes to bring a full-scale initiative to life at Reddit. The biggest takeaway is to iterate quickly but diligently—and worry about optimizing later! Reddit Everywhere (Winner: Product’s Pick and People’s Choice)Mayank Jain (u/mjmayank) Reddit Everywhere is a browser extension that loads the Reddit comments about the site you’re reading directly onto the webpage. Works on every site! Reddit has the best comments and discussion anywhere online, and I often find myself searching for the comments related to what I was just reading. I thought it would be awesome if they were just loaded inline for me to read right away. I had never made a browser extension before, so I learned a lot about how those work. I also learned about a ton of great subreddits that sites I frequently browse are posted in. Conclusion Finding the right balance between work focused on our product roadmap and encouraging people to branch out on their own in a constructive way has been a fun problem to work on. Many of these projects are not quite yet ready for production, but some have already shipped and the ones highlighted are on a good track to do so. We were so impressed with these results that we’re considering doing a full-blown Snoo’s Week next time! Interested in joining Team Reddit?

In this post, we’re going to give you a closer look at how we loaded both the new and old profile pages on different stacks. The motivation Part of my team’s work involved creating profile pages using Reddit’s new frontend stack (React + Redux). As part of a product decision, we decided to allow users to opt into the new profile experience during the beta period. The old profile pages remain on Reddit’s app servers, but the new profile pages are served by a completely different stack and service. Because of this, we needed a way to programmatically redirect to the appropriate stack depending on the profile being visited and whether it is part of the beta or not. We needed to do this higher up in the stack than either type of app server, which means we had to handle this logic at Fastly, our content delivery network (CDN). Since we were the first ones to use this new stack for a page in production, we were also the first ones to tackle redirecting traffic for a specific page to the new stack via Fastly. Fastly uses a derivative of the Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) to handle and modify requests, which allows us tremendous configuration flexibility. The development hack When we were still developing, we were able to test the new stack by first visiting a secret URL that would attach a cookie to our browser session. This special cookie then redirected any subsequent requests to a profile that we had added to Fastly’s whitelisted URLs to use the new stack’s servers. We were then able to load our test accounts with the new stack. For the alpha release, we just removed the secret URL requirement so that everyone was redirected. We were able to sustain this method since we only released profiles to a few select users and could hardcode a handful of URLs easily. Sample VCL snippet for the temporary redirect sub vcl_recv { set var.is_whitelisted_profile_page = ( req.url.path ~ \"(?i)^/user/Montanita/?$\" || req.url.path ~ \"(?i)^/user/totallyvalidtestaccount1/?$\" || req.url.path ~ \"(?i)^/user/totallyvalidtestaccount2/?$\" || req.url.path ~ \"(?i)^/user/totallyvalidtestaccount3/?$\" ) if (var.is_whitelisted_profile_page) { set req.backend = new_reddit_frontend; } else { set req.backend = reddit; } } However, when we wanted to release profile pages into an opt-in beta, this wasn’t sustainable as we couldn’t hardcode thousands of profile URLs. We also wanted users to have an immediate opt-in flow rather than submitting a request, so this would have been an issue for even tens or hundreds of profiles. Since we didn’t want to route all profiles over to the new stack, we needed another method. The solution Rather than rely on hardcoded URLs to determine the backend in Fastly, we moved the selection process to the main Reddit servers with an extra API call. To do this, we utilize the ability in the VCL code to restart requests in flight while retaining variables on the request object, such as storing the original URL and a special backend header that specifies which backend to use. Once we’ve determined that the incoming request matches the profile page URL regex and doesn’t have the special backend header attached, we create the special backend header on the request object initialized with a sentinel value. We also attach the original URL to a header on the request object since we’re about to change the request URL. The request URL is rewritten to swap out the “/user/” portion of the URL with the address of an API endpoint while still keeping the username portion so that the backend can be determined. When the request goes through to the API endpoint, the username is fetched from the URL and the Reddit app checks to see if the profile meets all of the conditions to be loaded in the new stack (such as having opted into the new profiles, is not deleted or banned, and matches the URLs that we support in the new frontend stack) to determine which backend to use. A special backend header is written onto the response object with the chosen backend, falling back to the original Reddit backend. When Fastly receives the response, the special backend header from the endpoint is copied to the request object, the request object’s URL is rewritten to be the original URL again, and the request is restarted. At this point, the special backend header on the request specifies which backend to use, so we just set the backend and let the request continue through on the chosen backend. Sample VCL snippet to fetch the backend location sub vcl_recv { # This is the first time the request for a profile page # has come through (no special backend header attached) if ( !req.http.dynamic-backend && req.url.path ~ \"(?i)^/user/(.*)/?(.*)\" ) { set req.http.dynamic-backend = \"sentinel\"; set req.http.original-url = req.url; set req.url = regsub(req.url, \"/user/\", backend_endpoint_url); set req.backend = reddit; } # The backend has already been determined, so use it if (req.http.dynamic-backend != \"sentinel\") { set req.backend = req.http.dynamic-backend; unset req.http.dynamic-backend; unset req.http.original-url; } } sub vcl_deliver { # If we have the special header in the response object, # put that in the request object and restart the request if (resp.http.dynamic-backend) { set req.url = req.http.original-url; set req.http.dynamic-backend = resp.http.dynamic-backend; restart; } } The implementation adds a little bit of overhead since Fastly now makes 2 requests per profile page request (one to fetch what server to use and one more to actually load the profile page from the correct app). The p99 overhead is around 12 ms (so 99% of requests are quicker than this) and the p90 overhead is 7.5 ms. The latency added was pretty small in most cases, and we can still improve the response times by adding caching in Fastly. Another method we could have tried is implementing a new service that returns which backend to use. The benefit of this is that it could have been reusable by other pages and services. However, it would have taken longer to implement, required storing which users opt in to the new profile, and in some cases it still would have made another request to the main backend to get more data to make the choice, so the downsides outweighed the benefits. Conclusion Using custom VCL in Fastly is powerful and allows us the flexibility of routing to different stacks, which is useful since we’re starting to migrate our frontend to an entirely new stack. With this change, we have been able to dynamically route 75,000 profiles of users that have opted into the new profile page beta. This implementation has already come in handy in employee testing the redesign (coming soon to a desktop site near you). In the meantime, if you haven’t made the switch to the new profile page on your Reddit account, you can follow this guide here!

You wouldn’t walk in to a final exam without studying, right? Well, we hope you wouldn’t walk into an interview without preparing either. Think of this as your study guide to acing your interviews. By now, you’ve probably already finished your introductory phone interview with someone on our recruiting team, so congrats on moving forward! Next, you’ll be diving into your first technical interview — this time over the phone with one of our engineers.The Technical Phone ScreenThis interview is more of a general aptitude test meant to map out your technical abilities against some basic concepts about the web and its security vulnerabilities. It will be roughly half Q&A-style, half coding exercises. You might not know the answer to every question, and we’re okay with that. The idea is to get a sense of your boundaries so we can determine if your expertise fits in with our team’s needs.As you work through the questions, be sure to explain how you got your answer and why you took that approach.Tip: Have your laptop powered on and ready for your interview. Make sure you’re either plugged in to the internet or connected to a reliable wifi network, and double check that you get a strong cell signal in the location from which you plan to take the call.The Onsite InterviewIf you made it this far, you’re almost there. Your onsite interviews will be broken down into three technical interviews and three Q&A-style interviews. All in all, it should last about 5 hours (give or take), so come in well-rested. Environment Your interviews will take place in a room with a whiteboard, which you’ll make good use of during your technical interviews. You should also bring your laptop, or let us know if you’d prefer we provide one. Your technical interviews will take place either on the whiteboard or via coderpad on your laptop (which your interviewer will share with you when you meet). Given the nature of our work, we’re generally a casual office (within reason, of course!). There’s no dress code; we recommend coming in whatever you feel comfortable wearing. Technical Interviews Your technical interviews will take up the bulk of the time you spend onsite with us, about three hours total (one hour per technical interview). We ask you to bring your laptop because we’d like to see you actually code in real time. While these interviews will focus heavily on your technical abilities, your interviewers will also be evaluating for other important factors like work style and team fit. Coding/Algorithms. You’ll complete two coding interviews while onsite, one focusing on general software engineering concepts, the other delving deeper into your area of expertise (whether that be frontend, backend, machine learning, etc.). For the general coding interview, we encourage you to solve in whatever language you feel most comfortable using. The questions you’ll encounter during this part can usually be solved in lots of different ways, using recursive or iterative techniques.System Design. Unlike your other tech interviews, this one will not be code-focused, but you’ll most likely make good use of the whiteboard. You should expect to encounter questions along the lines of “How do you build a service that does X?” and “How do you scale said service?” You should also come prepared with a solid understanding of how the internet works. Some things to keep in mind Don’t neglect the conversational aspect of interviewing. The goal of our technical interviews isn’t to see whether or not you can get the right answer, but to test how well you work with others. Just as you would think of a teammate, it’s important to consider your interviewer as someone who’s there to help you solve the problem. We understand that no one person can do everything, and that’s why we intentionally build our teams to have diverse backgrounds and skill sets. We’re more interested in finding out where your skills lie than trying to find the perfect engineer. If you forget everything else from this guide, taking these three points to heart will put you well ahead of the pack in your tech interviews: Listen to and really consider your interviewer’s advice. They’ve probably asked each question a hundred different times and they’ve seen many ways to solve it. Their job is to help you find the best way.Communicate your thought process out loud. Be able to explain the pros and cons of your approach. We care a lot more about how you came to a solution than whether you actually got there.Don’t jump into writing code before you’ve thought through how you’ll get to the solution. As one of our engineers once told me, you wouldn’t start building a work bench without thinking about the dimensions of the wood and how to fit each piece together; likewise, you should know how you’re going to solve a problem before you start to write code. Q&A Interviews At Reddit, we’re all about empowering people to be their true selves. While your technical interviews are likely to be somewhat mentally demanding, your Q&A interviews are meant to be more relaxed. These are usually conducted by someone who’s not on the team you’re interviewing for, and the idea is for us to get to know you better beyond your technical abilities. Candidate AMA. The goal of this interview is to get to know you on a personal level since most of your interviews are more focused on what you can do on a computer. That said, the best way to approach this interview is just to be ready to talk about yourself. It will be the most unstructured interview you’ll encounter here, but hopefully it will give you more insight into how we work, and vice versa. Tip: Come prepared with questions about our culture, guiding principles, and day-to-day life at the office. You should be able to draw parallels between what really gets you going and our company values. Cross Functional Interview. As you could probably tell from the title, the goal of this interview is to get a sense of how you work with other teams. Unless you’re in an infrastructure role, you’ll be working closely with our product team, so we need to make sure you can interface well with skill sets different from your own. This means being able to communicate fluidly and resolve conflict effectively. You’ll be meeting with one of our product managers for this interview, which makes it the ideal time to ask questions about how Reddit works and what’s on our product roadmap this year. Tip: To prepare for this interview, come up with a few professional anecdotes that will help you show off your interpersonal chops. Think ahead about how you would tell those stories to convey certain behavioral attributes in your interview. Hiring Manager Interview. This interview will most likely be the last one of the day (hurray!). Your prospective manager will review your work at a high level, delving into specific projects you’ve worked on to try to get a sense of how you’d fit into their team. It’s a great opportunity for you to ask any lingering questions you have about what projects you’d work on, organizational structure, and the team’s roadmap for the rest of the year. What happens next? So you made it through the onsite — great job! We know it wasn’t easy. Now that you’ve finished the hardest part, you can expect to hear from your recruiter about how things went within a week of your interviews. Got questions in the meantime? Don’t hesitate to reach out to us! We’re here to support you every step of the way. Further Reading Interested in joining Team Reddit?

I think it’s an art form — bringing the right mix of people together, in the right configuration, with the right motivation takes a certain kind of love and patience that only managers will understand. I don’t just talk about building strong, diverse engineering teams. I’ve done it a few times before and I’m doing my best to build a great one at Reddit. Now, this is a diversity and inclusion blog post so you might think that I’m about to begin the next paragraph with something like “as a black man, I think it’s important to invest in diversity and inclusiveness…” But that’s not how this post is going to start. As an experienced leader and technology executive, I believe it’s important to invest in diversity and inclusiveness for better products, for better teams, and because it’s just the right thing to do. Better Teams, Better Products I’ll start with the easy stuff. Diverse engineering teams are simply more fun to work in. There’s the opportunity to learn more from your peers either directly or through ERIGs and technology guilds. There’s less fear of speaking your mind. Finally, the empathy that comes with an inclusive mindset leads to fewer interpersonal and inter-team conflicts. This benefit is particularly important to Reddit because we’re growing fast while shipping fast. Our engineering teams must coordinate with each other heavily to keep the trains running on time. Anything that can reduce the “otherness” of working with dependent product teams makes us more effective as an organization. If you want the hard numbers, there’s mounting evidence that diverse teams produce better products and business outcomes. Catalyst’s “Why Diversity Matters” is my favorite summary of the subject, and it really covers the topic exhaustively from every angle imaginable. Statistically, diverse teams are more innovative, more collaborative, and have better financial performance. Here are a few other studies: McKinsey’s research shows that gender-diverse companies are 15% more likely to outperform their peers and ethnically-diverse companies are 35% more likely to do the same.Deloitte Australia’s research shows that inclusive teams outperform their peers by 80% in team-based assessments.Research by Cedric Herring at the University of Chicago found that across hundreds of companies, diverse teams drive 6% greater revenue, 15% more customer wins, and create significantly higher market share.Bersin High-Impact Talent Management saw these results in a two-year study: among more than 128 different talent practices studied, the highest performing companies are all focused on building an inclusive talent system. But if you don’t want the quantitative analysis, here’s what Steve Jobs said: A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have. —Steve Jobs Which cuts straight to the heart of why diversity is important to Reddit: we believe that everyone in the world should be able to find a home — a community — somewhere on our platform. But we aren’t there yet. If we’re being honest, Reddit is still a place that can feel unwelcoming and intimidating to users, new and old. So what do we do? I think the solution is right here within the walls of Reddit HQ, starting with how we build our product development organization. Most managers are familiar with Conway’s Law, which says that companies are destined to ship products that match the the shape of their org chart. It’s been demonstrated time and again since the inception of the software industry. If you believe Conway, is it so hard to believe that organizations are also destined to ship products that are a reflection of their employees? That the thoughts, beliefs, and culture of an organization are ultimately expressed in the software it produces? Simply put, to make Reddit a home for everyone in the world, we have to start by making our office a better reflection of the world. A “Better Place” I’ve heard the phrase, sometimes ironically but often genuinely, “We’re making the world a better place,” about ten thousand times since I moved to the Bay last year. And you know, I’ll be damned if I don’t still believe it. Growing up in Largo, Maryland —a predominantly black suburb east of DC — I dreamed of someday making it big in the world. Getting a great job, driving a fancy car, maybe buying a nice house somewhere in Potomac. Most of my friends had that dream too but chose a different path to try and get there, spending their time in sports, family-run businesses, or government jobs. Anywhere but engineering. Very few of them thought to pursue technology careers because they didn’t know what was possible. There was no engineering role model — no black Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg— to follow. Most of them didn’t have access to modern computers at home or at school. Of the few who chose tech, only a tiny fraction with pioneering and persistent spirits ever made it to Silicon Valley. If I could go back in time and tell my friends, I would scream at the top of my lungs: Learn to code! Get into engineering! When people talk about “the land of opportunity” this is what they mean! Even the biggest cynic has to admit that technology is radically transforming our work, our health, our relationships, everything! It’s all changing faster and faster each day and Silicon Valley is at the heart. The Valley is a well-funded magnet for dreamers and risk takers. It celebrates both successes and failures, because of the lessons learned in either outcome can be carried forward to the next venture. And while the Valley may be populated by dreamers, it’s only because they know the opportunity to have vast impact is real. Their heroes are the same tech entrepreneurs who’ve already proven that no dream is too big. Objectively speaking, Silicon Valley is one of the greatest opportunity-generation engines in history. Which brings me to my point. If there exists a fantastic engine producing world-changing opportunities and leaders with every turn of the crank, and that engine is biased to exclude whole classes of people, then something is wrong. Are we missing good ideas? Are we leaving people behind? Are we perhaps not living up to the full potential of “making the world a better place”? I’m a practical sort of manager. I don’t think we can handhold people on the path to opportunity regardless of race or gender. I think that everyone has to make their own way, that merit matters, and that not everyone is guaranteed a spot in the winner’s circle. But as I see it, equal access and equal opportunity are just the right thing to do. Building Our Team At Reddit, we’re fortunate in that we’re small and growing. We have the flexibility to build the engineering team any way we’d like. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished so far while acknowledging that we’ve still got a long way to go. After 10 months on the job, here’s what I think we’ve done right when it comes to D&I. Executive level support D&I efforts have to come from the top to have any hope of success. I’ve seen this go wrong in other companies, where too much emphasis is placed on a bottoms-up approach to D&I. It isn’t the responsibility of your individual contributors to enact fundamental culture changes. At Reddit, we don’t just talk about D&I and it isn’t just a directive from HR. It is an executive-level conversation with our leaders setting a tone of support throughout every part of the company. We see D&I as a key component to employee engagement and have continuous discussions about how we can positively change the metric. Down the line from exec to director to manager to individual contributor, the entire company understands the culture we’re trying to build. Hiring into leadership roles for greater impact Perhaps the long struggle for improvements in D&I has made me cynical, but whenever I see an announcement about a new Chief Diversity Officer being appointed, I wonder how many product engineers and managers they are actually going to place. Typically, these roles are used to raise awareness of D&I or simply show that the company is supportive. I like that to an extent. But at this point in the history of D&I, I don’t think our industry has an awareness problem, it has an action problem. It’s simply harder for someone to have an impact when they aren’t directly responsible for hiring. Reddit takes the approach of hiring diverse leaders into critical positions across our organization. The exec team itself reflects this ethos, which makes me think we’ve done something right at the top. But the middle still needs work. We want to hire diverse managers and senior engineers deeper within the team. Doing that means overcoming the “pipeline problem.” If you care about D&I in the Valley it’s easy to complain about “the pipeline,” and I don’t beat people up if they do. Hiring is tough in general, even more so for startups. I admit was a bit shocked after posting my first Reddit job to LinkedIn back in October. It was for a Director of Engineering position, usually a hot commodity. Out of the roughly 30 applicants there was one woman, and every candidate was either White or Asian. I’d never seen results like this in my career, but I couldn’t throw my hands up. There may really be a pipeline problem, but if so, it’s our responsibility as leaders to build a better pipe. Here’s what I did. Setting realistic expectations with hiring managers First, just setting the tone matters a lot. Early on, I told my staff that my vision for Reddit engineering included diverse teams of extremely talented professionals and promising upstarts. We weren’t going to rush to fill every position. It would take extra time, energy, and discipline to get the results I wanted. Fortunately, my managers were immediately supportive and stayed that way even through the frustration of longer hiring cycles and occasionally losing diverse candidates to another company. We have a long road ahead, but knowing that my team has a shared vision gives me confidence that we’ll stay the course. Widening the net by overcoming common biases Second, I had to search in new places for candidates. It required a bit of a mindset shift. Prior to moving to the Bay Area I had very little experience with and a somewhat negative impression of coding bootcamps. I admit, at Microsoft I was one of those hiring managers who scanned for top schools and top companies before taking a deeper look. (If you didn’t know, that’s a huge D&I fail I just admitted to.) At Reddit, I think maybe the first week on the job, I met with students from Hackbright Academy and was completely blown away by their intensity, drive, and potential. These women wanted to win. Since then, I’ve come to believe that hustle trumps academics. We’ve hired multiple bootcamp grads, some of whom have quickly risen to become strong engineering leaders. I’ve also expanded my own network to include /dev/color, Bay Area Blacks in Tech, and Stealth Mode. I’m also proud that this year Reddit will be a sponsor for the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing and we’re sending more of our employees to attend than ever. Polishing the Reddit brand Third, and no surprises, is branding. Reddit is an edgy company with a complex history that some diverse candidates find worrisome. I’ve lost track of the number of times I’ve been quizzed about a negative news article or just asked bluntly, “I thought only white computer geeks used Reddit?” The reality is that a lot of positive change has happened at the company since the return of our founders, Steve and Alexis, more than two years ago. Internally, Reddit hasn’t been the straight-cis-white-male-nerd bastion it’s portrayed as for a long time. But no candidate would know this if we didn’t start taking control of our external brand. The real turning point came around April with the launch of r/place. That April Fool’s Day project made headlines for weeks because it was an enormous feat of both culture and engineering hackery: millions of users simultaneously drawing art on a canvas shared by the entire world. It was “uniquely beautiful,” according to Newsweek, “a lesson in diplomacy and democracy, in creation and destruction, in war and peace.” It got the world to think about Reddit and online communities just a little differently. We blogged about r/place and almost immediately noticed a change in our incoming pipeline. It taught us that we needed to get the word out. So we blogged a bit more. Then I started sending my engineers to conferences and meetups. We’ve even hosted a few events at the HQ. The mix and enthusiasm of candidates in our pipeline today is steadily improving from last year. As we continue to make our platform more welcoming to new users, we expect even more engineers to take notice. Protecting and nurturing an inclusive culture Culture is a bit of an overused buzzword in Silicon Valley, but the truth is that culture matters. It influences everything from the motivation of employees, to product design, and even customer perception. I was fortunate to inherit a great culture at Reddit that already highly valued inclusion. My task has been more about protecting that culture as we grow rapidly, which is one of the toughest challenges for organizational development. I worked with Katelin Holloway (Reddit’s truly brilliant People and Culture executive) to help build a hiring process that I believe is unmatched when it comes to hiring humble, impact-driven engineers. We aren’t doing anything magical. Our process has just a few extra rounds of non-technical and cross-discipline interviews crafted by Katelin and her team. Simple, but it makes a huge difference in identifying strong team players and filtering out “brilliant jerks” who will stifle inclusion. Finally, stay committed. I was at D&I event a few months back at a Valley company I won’t name. The Chief Diversity Officer got on stage and said, “Here we try not to see color. We’ve evolved to focus on diversity of thought versus diversity of race and gender.” Pro-tip: telling a black person you don’t see color is sort of like saying you don’t see them at all. I spoke with the CDO later to ask what he meant. He told me that after years of effort, D&I programs hadn’t moved the needle on race. Thought leaders and academics were moving into other areas and taking new approaches. I just walked away. Since then I’ve read and heard similar sentiments from D&I thought leaders. I’ll simply say that one thing I think we get right about this issue at Reddit is patience and commitment. D&I isn’t a fad and I’m proud to say that Reddit is serious about tackling the issue. I see it every day in our leaders, product decisions, hiring practices, company events, and the way we treat each other. That said, it certainly isn’t all rainbows and sunshine. Reddit, and the tech industry as a whole, still has a lot of work to do when it comes to improving D&I. Personally, I think it’s time for the industry to move from awareness to action. We can’t go another decade without moving the needle. As a small and fast-growing company, Reddit gets to build D&I into its DNA from the beginning. If your company is already big and established, you have a tougher road to walk. You might need to culture shift, change personnel, or fix your brand. It’s worth it. You will make better products, have more engaged employees, and you might even get to make the world a better place. We’re making it happen here at Reddit — one hire, one conversation, one changed mind at time. If we can do it, you can too."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-announces-first-ever-olympic-ama-series","date":"2017-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Reddit Announces First-Ever Olympic AMA Series","text":"Reddit is launching the first-ever AMA Olympic Conversation Series!

While many of our official efforts were coordinated in advance, the organic response from the Reddit community was overwhelming—with over 100 subreddits, large and small, independently lending their voices to the effort. So overwhelming, in fact, we thought it merited a quick recap—featuring highlights with some of our favorite posts, discussions, CSS changes, and comments—to show the scale and creativity of redditors’ engagement on the Day of Action. (Curious about the history of Reddit’s engagement on net neutrality? Check out our blog post from earlier this week.) Calls to Action At the stroke of midnight, visitors to our front page were greeted with something that (almost) never appears on our site: a pop-up. The message, from Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman, looked like this: Meanwhile, the logo in the top-left corner of the site displayed our alien mascot Snoo with a bit of interference from internet service providers. On the morning of the Day of Action, co-founder Alexis Ohanian published a letter explaining why net neutrality is essential for entrepreneurs, consumers, and the internet as a whole, and urging redditors to join the effort to preserve the open internet. At the end of his post, Alexis asked readers to comment with stories and explanations of why the open internet is important to them, and redditors responded en masse. In total, the post received almost 10,000 comments, over 180,000 upvotes, and more than 1,000,000 views. The comments represented the wide range of groups that care about net neutrality, with IT workers, entrepreneurs, casual internet users, and even employees of internet service providers chiming in with their stories. Here are a few of our favorites: (You can read more on the original post.) Alexis also spoke with CNN Money, The Verge, Politico, and Bloomberg to explain what’s at stake for the internet if net neutrality is repealed. AMAs In addition to the net neutrality-themed AMAs from Senator Brian Schatz and the Washington Post’s tech journalist leading up to the Day of Action, a number of open internet advocates took to Reddit to discuss the details of net neutrality rules, from both policy and tech perspectives. ICYMI, check out the AMAs from an analyst, a strategy director, a technologist, and an attorney on the ACLU’s tech team: Dane Jasper, the CEO of Northern California’s largest independent internet service provider: And President and CEO of the Internet Association, Michael Beckerman, who stopped by r/technology with Engine Policy Director Evan Engstrom: Communities Coming Together But one of the best parts of the Day of Action on Reddit came directly from individual subreddits, whose moderators and users decided to participate in a wide variety of ways. Many subreddits opted to modify their CSS so that redditors would see this message instead: Some communities like r/MemeEconomy and r/videos included error messages in their CSS to bring awareness to the Day of Action, while others altered their CSS to black out their subreddits entirely, like r/HighQualityGifs. A few particularly enterprising communities like r/woahdude, r/gifs, and r/nottheonion even configured their respective subreddits’ AutoMod to automatically post a comment on each post driving users to battleforthenet.com. Even more communities across Reddit stickied posts about net neutrality to the top of their front pages. Even Reddit communities that didn’t formally sign on to participate found themselves abuzz with discussions of the open internet from users who were out of the loop, looking for a neutral take on the issue, or just in need of a good internet cat. Thank you to all the communities, moderators, and millions of redditors who participated in the Day of Action.

We’re also hosting an ongoing Net Neutrality AMA series in the lead-up to our site-wide engagements on the Day of Action. Why We Care But first, here’s some background on why this fight is important to us. Net neutrality rules, set by the FCC, ensure that internet service providers treat all internet traffic the same. They may not block, throttle, or otherwise restrict content. Without net neutrality, these providers could privilege their own content or slow down other traffic for their own profit. This would jeopardize one of the defining features of the internet: openness and consumer choice. In fact, Reddit itself would likely not exist without the open internet. When Reddit launched a little over twelve years ago, the team behind it was tiny, attracting users solely through word of mouth. Since then, the site has grown year after year and currently has around 300 million monthly users, but we would not have been able to reach this point if people had to pay extra to access our site. Reddit is built on the premise of letting individuals decide what content they find interesting. We believe the same basic principle should apply to the internet as a whole. Ask Reddit Historians Fortunately, the FCC’s commenting period is open until August 16, and redditors have a long history of making their voices heard in the fight for net neutrality. We’ve seen a single post inspire thousands of comments on the FCC’s website: In 2015, our users made 15,000 phone calls to the FCC and Congress in the span of three hours: Our tireless co-founder Alexis Ohanian, patching redditors through to the FCC after personally upvoting each call. They also raised money to help put up pro-net neutrality ads in DC: And, of course, redditors have been known to get the occasional handwritten thank-you note from the President for their unfailing grassroots engagement: (Thanks, Obama.) Day of Action Last month, we kicked off a net neutrality-themed AMA series leading up to the Day of Action, bringing politicians, journalists, and open internet advocates to Reddit to discuss why protecting the open internet is important. Here are a couple of our favorite AMAs, from Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz and Washington Post technology reporter Brian Fung: On July 12, we’re planning a site-wide engagement to encourage redditors to voice their support for the open internet, along with a special message from our co-founder Alexis, who has led the charge for the open internet at Reddit for years. Unsurprisingly, this fight has already been top of mind for communities across Reddit, with discussions of the FCC’s impending repeal lighting up subreddits like r/technology, r/Futurology, r/news, and r/politics, as well as dedicated pro-net neutrality communities like r/KeepOurNetFree. Even subreddits that have no overt connection to politics have joined the conversation. We’re proud that over a hundred communities have already signed on to participate alongside us in Fight for the Future’s Day of Action—from huge subreddits with millions of subscribers (r/videos, r/movies, r/music), gaming communities (r/PCMasterRace, r/hearthstone, r/DnD), fan subreddits (r/adventuretime, r/DunderMifflin, r/adultswim), animal lovers (r/Thisismylifemeow, r/Blop), meme lovers (r/MemeEconomy, r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns), and more.

Great! But how? Frontend engineering is in a very different state than it was when Reddit was first conceived. We have a large depth of options for just about every layer of web app development. From how to render views, style content, serve assets, and write code, frontend development has at least a couple of options. One of the first questions we had to answer was “what language should we use?” Surprisingly, the answer does not have to be Javascript. Ultimately, whatever language you pick will compile down to Javascript. But what the language compiles down to is perhaps less important than what the developer writes. And the choices are numerous: BucklescriptClojureScriptCoffeescriptElmElixirscriptJavascript 2016 and beyondJavascript + annotationsNimPureScriptReasonTypescript …just to name a few. Each language comes with its pros and cons, so to aid in picking one, we needed to establish a few requirements: Must have types. Types serve as documentation at the micro-level, help ensure correctness (to a certain degree), and most importantly, make refactoring code less stressful. Another consideration was the speed of development. We wanted to add types because we wanted to move quickly. This sounds a bit antithetical to how many people view types, in that it adds overhead to development and therefore slows developers down. However, in moving quickly, it is much easier to introduce bugs. We looked to types to help keep our code correct even in the fast pace we were moving at. Types also help codebases scale. Our engineering team is growing fast (we’re hiring!), and the number of people making contributions is only going to increase.Must have good tooling already. Considering the scope of the product work (major redesign), we don’t have the time to build out a significant amount of tooling ourselves. It was pretty important that we could get started fairly quickly with readily available open source solutions. To be more specific, the sort of tooling we were looking for was integration with popular build tools (e.g., Webpack), support for linting, and easy integration with testing frameworks. If integrating the language tooling was not obvious, we skipped it.Powers major production apps. If a language looks great, but is really only used for hobbyist projects, it might not be the right fit. It also creates uncertainty with respect to the lifetime of the language and the cadence with which issues would be resolved.Our devs should be able to onboard fairly quickly. There are some excellent languages in the list above that would simply take too long for our devs to adapt to. Languages like Elm and Purescript are prime examples. We seriously debated their use, but in the end, it felt like it would be too much work to teach new programming concepts to unfamiliar devs while trying to meet the demanding product goals.Should work on both the client and the server. SEO is very important to Reddit, so lack of universal rendering is a deal breaker.Good library support. We don’t want to write everything from scratch. There are some problems where a library solution is the best. We want to keep that as an option. After considering these requirements, our two best options seemed to be either Typescript or Javascript + Flow. Before we could pick between them, we needed to understand where they differ. Compilation vs Annotation One major difference between Typescript and Flow is that Typescript is a language that compiles down to Javascript, whereas Flow is a set of annotations you can add to existing Javascript that can then be checked for correctness by a tool. This has subtle implications for how code is written. Consider, for example, enums in both systems: Typescript <i>enum</i> VoteDirection { upvoted = 1, notvoted = 0, downvoted = -1, }; <i>const</i> voteState: VoteDirection = VoteDirection.upvoted; Flow <i>const</i> voteDirections = { upvoted: 1, notvoted: 0, downvoted: -1, }; <i>type</i> VoteDirection = $Keys<typeof voteDirections>; <i>const</i> voteState: VoteDirection = voteDirections.upvoted; Since Typescript will compile, it can create types that also have a runtime definition. In Flow, however, the types are just annotations, so we can’t rely on any sort of code transform to create runtime representations of our types. Typescript’s compilation, however, has its drawbacks. When integrating Typescript into existing code bases, Typescript’s compilation has the possibility of complicating the build process. At Reddit, we had an existing build process using Babel as a transpilation layer. There were a few optimizations that we wanted to preserve even as we added Typescript, so we needed a way of integrating Typescript without significantly disrupting what we had already. The end result was a much more complex build step. By contrast, Flow’s type annotations are automatically removed by Babel. Had we adopted Flow, our build step would have stayed simple. Soundness/Correctness Flow generally does a better job here. Flow, by default, does not allow nullable types. Typescript added support for non-nullable types in 2.x, but it is something that you need to remember to enable. Flow also does a better job inferring types, whereas Typescript will often fallback to using the “any” type. Beyond nullability and type inference, Flow also has a better story for covariance and contravariance (you can read more about Flow’s variance here). One such example where this ends up being a problem is in arrays. By default, arrays in Flow are invariant. That means in Flow, this will throw an error: Flow <i>class</i> <i>Animal</i><i> {}</i> <i>class</i> <i>Bird</i> <i>extends</i><i> Animal {}</i> <i>const</i> <i>foo</i><i>:</i><i> Array<Bird> </i><i>=</i><i> [];</i> <i>foo</i><i>.push(</i><i>new</i> <i>Animal</i><i>());</i> <i>/*</i> <i>foo.push(new A);</i> <i> ^ A. This type is incompatible with</i> <i>const foo: Array<B> = [];</i> <i> ^ B</i> <i>*/</i> But in Typescript, this is okay: Typescript <i>class</i> Animal {} <i>class</i> Bird <i>extends</i> Animal {} <i>const</i> foo: Array<Bird> = []; foo.push(new Animal()); <i>// ok in typescript</i> There are more examples you can find online, but the general consensus is that Flow does a better job at type-checking compared to Typescript. Ecosystem So far, Flow seems to have a simpler setup and is better at type-checking. So why did we go with Typescript? One of the Typescript’s largest strengths is its ecosystem. Typescript’s library support is fantastic; just about all the libraries we use have either type descriptors in the library itself or a representation in DefinitelyTyped. In addition, Typescript has great Intellisense support in VSCode and plugins for other popular editors we use (like Atom and Sublime Text). Furthermore, we discovered that Typescript parses JSDoc annotations. This was especially helpful as we were migrating over to Typescript from Javascript. Typescript also came with a lot of “social proof” and better assurances about its longevity There are several large projects using Typescript (examples include VSCode, Rxjs, Angular, and Typescript itself), so we felt confident that its feature set could support our product goals, and the language would stick around for several years. One of the worries we had with Flow was that it was built to solve specific needs at Facebook and that its future would be determined by that scope. Typescript, on the other hand, is a more general purpose offering from Microsoft, so we felt that if we surfaced issues, they would be heard. In addition, because Typescript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript, we could expect that any ES6+ features that Typescript supports would have corresponding types. The language and its type system would move in lock-step because both are developed together. Summary We picked Typescript because we are confident we could onboard devs quickly (the number of frontend engineers has tripled in the last year), the language could support our product goals of redesigning the entire site, it would stick around for a while, and it would integrate well with our codebase. But most importantly, we switched to using a language that is typed. Using a typed language in our frontend has already paid dividends: our code has fewer type-related bugs, we are more confident making large refactors, and our inline documentation is focused around concepts instead of object shapes and function parameters. Overall, we are very happy with our choice.

Equal parts stand-up comedy show, open mic, and donation drive for feminine hygiene products, the “Period Party” drew four times the expected crowd and raised nearly $7,000 by the end of the night. “We’re excited to partner with Simply the Basics for this event and by volunteering throughout the year because we believe in the power of building and supporting communities,” said Farah Kassam, Reddit’s Director of Talent Development. “When we relocated Reddit’s headquarters to our new office space in the Tenderloin, it was really important for all of us to participate in and contribute to our local community. This event was a unique way for us to raise awareness about Simply the Basics’ critical work.” Simply the Basics founder Meghan Freebeck kicked off the event by clarifying exactly what type of Period Party attendees should expect. “A lot of people said, ‘Oh, what period?’ Like they thought it would be a time period party,” she joked, before stressing the critical need for feminine hygiene products among women experiencing homelessness and how Simply the Basics helps through hygiene banks. Freebeck then gave a shoutout to the Reddit employees who have been volunteering with Simply the Basics since we relocated our office to the Tenderloin. “Reddit is a phenomenal partner of ours. They are constantly collecting products for us, they support us, [and] they are in our neighborhood.” After delving into the specific programs that Simply the Basics facilitates (which you can read more about here), Freebeck stressed that improving menstrual hygiene for those experiencing homelessness includes reducing stigma around menstruation in the first place. With that, she introduced the headliner, comedian Dhaya Lakshminarayanan, for the first of the evening’s many, many period stories. “I do believe that we have to reduce stigma by talking about this,” she said. “Menstruation is not any different from having the flu.” Lakshminarayanan went on to recall how she reduced stigma within her own family, with her physicist father in particular evolving from being uncomfortable discussing “anything about women or bodies or anything like that” to sending his daughter two cases of panty liners when asked to give her a “practical” gift. Three more comedians followed Lakshminarayanan with personal tales of their “first and worst periods” everywhere from school to a swimming pool, after which they opened the stage to any attendee who felt like sharing. “It was great to see how many women not only came to the event but also decided to share their stories because they wanted to be a part of reducing the stigma,” said Kassam after the event. “We were blown away by the turnout and all the donations, and can’t wait to partner with Simply the Basics for more events and volunteer opportunities in the future.” You can read more about last night’s event in SF Weekly."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/highlights-from-global-reddit-meetup-day-2017","date":"2017-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Highlights from Global Reddit Meetup Day 2017","text":"Earlier this month, we celebrated one of our favorite Reddit traditions: Global Reddit Meetup Day.

If you’ve spent any time in r/baseball, the largest of Reddit’s network of pro-baseball communities, you’ve probably seen the username u/MLBOfficial next to many of the community’s top posts. On any given day, you may find the MLB posting a TIL (Today I Learned) from baseball history, behind-the-scenes shots from their meetings, gift exchanges, or even highlight videos featuring time-synced, on-screen comments from redditors: After joining in April 2015, the MLB quickly became a fixture of r/baseball, passing the 50,000 Reddit karma milestone last fall, then more than doubling that in just a few months. But how did their account get to this point and where does their innate grasp of Reddit come from? We talked to Will Frasure, New Media Strategist for the MLB, to discuss the history of their account and where they’d like to see their Reddit presence go in the future. “The first person who was running our Reddit account was actually a part-time social person who was a huge redditor,” Frasure writes. “He basically convinced our bosses to get on board based on things he’d seen with the NBA and r/nba.” Frasure, on the other hand, wasn’t such a hard-core user at the start of the MLB’s Reddit engagement. “At the time, I was just a very casual redditor, skimming the front page and some of the bigger subs,” he says. “This was during the 2015 season. Our launch was very light, with just weekly discussions that we led on r/baseball and some random content posting. When 2016 started, we had decided that we wanted to pitch to our 30 clubs to get involved in their team subreddits.” However, before the MLB could extend the pitch, the MLB’s original poster left and Frasure took over what he calls the “Reddit operation.” “We started customizing content for r/baseball and interacting with fans daily,” he writes, “and I really wanted to let it rip on r/baseball. So I started spending my free time at work (2 to 3 hours a day some days) reading r/baseball and getting the lay of the land while commenting.” Soon, Frasure leveled up the account’s activity, with original content made exclusively for r/baseball. “For the most part, we were pleasantly surprised,” he says. “We would get some people saying how they thought it was weird we were on there. As we started to act more like a fan rather than a brand, people started getting used to the presence …” Perhaps the best marker of the community’s appreciation for the MLB’s “Reddit operation” is a post from last November, which Frasure ranks as one of his favorite moments in r/baseball. The day after the Cubs won the World Series, the MLB shared a simple thank-you note to redditors in r/baseball, which hit the front page and received over 600 comments from users thanking the MLB and encouraging them to stick around during the off-season. “One of my other favorites,” Frasure recalls, “is when we worked with various team subreddit mods to surprise fans with tickets during our postseason. We ended up with an amazing interaction with a Cubs fan for tickets to Game 1 of the NLDS against the Giants.” As for the MLB’s new user profile on Reddit (which you can check out—and follow!—here), Frasure hopes he can use it to find ways to reach redditors who may not be baseball superfans. The MLB’s user profile page (u/MLBOfficial) “We are already so close to those fans on r/baseball, but in a way it’s an echo chamber, as everyone there already loves baseball,” he writes. “We’d hypothetically would like to convert some non-baseballers with content there.” While the MLB will continue to stay active in the pro baseball communities, he notes that the ability to make posts directly on their profile offers “a way for us to show our Reddit chops outside of r/baseball.” In the meantime, Frasure has this to say on his time posting and commenting on Reddit over the past two years. “It has made my job immensely more enjoyable. The fans on r/baseball are amazingly insightful, caring and funny. It really affirms why I wanted to get into this line of work.” You can follow the MLB’s new user profile at u/MLBOfficial."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/why-publishers-should-use-reddit-embeds","date":"2017-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product & Design"],"title":"Why Publishers Should Use Reddit Embeds","text":"Reddit is full of stories. With our embed tool, it’s never been easier for journalists to highlight (and credit) the thousands of stories happening on our site every day. From AMAs and viral photos to in-depth discussions and high-quality gifs, redditors’ original content gives writers a constant supply of subjects to write about. Today, we’re going to give some well-deserved props to a few media outlets that we’ve seen doing a great job embedding this original content—and explain how outlets new to our embed tool can use it in their next story. But first, why use embeds? Launched for comments in 2015 and posts in 2016, our embed tool makes it easy to share redditors’ text posts, photos, gifs, and comment threads in a format that looks much cleaner than the fuzzy screenshots of yore. It’s also the best way to cite and credit the users and communities responsible for this content, so that every piece of content is attributed and linked back to the OP (original poster). Here’s how to use them. To embed a post, click the “share” button under the post title. On the right, you’ll see an orange button with an embed symbol. Click it and you’ll receive a pop-up window with a media preview and the embed code. Here, you can choose not to show the post text if it’s been edited after you embed it. Under this option, there’s an additional checkbox that allows you to pull an embed code compatible with Facebook Instant Articles. For comments, just click the “embed” button under the comment and follow the same steps above. As with embedded posts, embedded comments will respect the author’s edits and deletions, and they’ll always feature a link back to the original thread and subreddit. You can also grab the Facebook Instant Article embed code by clicking the link right under the regular embed code for your site. You also have the option of including the parent comment, which is particularly helpful for AMAs in which you want to show the AMA subject’s answers and the original questions from redditors. For AMAs, we recommend taking each answer you want to highlight, clicking “embed” on the comment containing the answer, and checking “Include parent comment.” Here’s a great example from PopSugar. Pro tip: Photos in posts are also embeddable! Just use the same instructions above to embed a post, using the media preview to see how the photo will appear. Best in Embeds: Publisher’s Edition And now it’s time to raise an upvote to all the publishers consistently using our embed tool to feature, credit, and link back to the content behind the stories. Here are a few of our favorite recent uses of embeds: TIME“Viral Photo Proves Someone’s Grandma Is Basically Scarlett Johansson’s Lookalike” AOL“Man proposes to boyfriend on Splash Mountain in adorable viral photo” Huffington Post“Toddler Invites Reddit To Ask Him Anything, And His Answers Rule” Questions?

In this article, we will discuss how we built the feed by starting with the building blocks of MVC, breaking out the networking code, creating powerful abstractions for handling paginated feeds, creating the building blocks of the UI, and optimizing to achieve high-performance scrolling. Using these techniques we were able to build a feed which had a very low crash rate (99.95% crash-free sessions) with an architecture that is still being used and extended today. Primarily, the iOS app was designed to be a way to visualize and interact with Reddit content, including most importantly the feed of posts that make up the front page and subreddits. Unlike on the web, in the app the front page is displayed as an infinitely scrolling feed of posts. We sought to keep the app lightweight and rely on the server as the source of truth, maintaining simple caching only when needed for performance reasons. We wanted to build a general purpose feed that could support high-performance scrolling and be extensible for the future. In order for the feed to serve as a foundation, we needed to build isolated components that could be reused throughout the app. However, we also needed to build many Reddit-specific features to support multiple types of posts from text and links to photos and gifs. Additionally, we needed to consider other customization options like night mode and compact mode. Starting With Simple MVC With an open-ended problem like how to build a feed, there are many architectures to consider, but on iOS the most common pattern is MVC, model-view-controller. So, perhaps the simplest approach to building a feed would be to create a view controller called FeedViewController (controller) which fetches Post objects (model) and displays them with a UICollectionView (view). The problem is that you quickly end up with a different sort of MVC: the Massive View Controller, where the size of the controller’s code gets out of control since it contains too much logic. Also, if we want to try to reuse logic from the feed in other places it would be tough to do. More philosophically, we want to adhere to the principle of separation of concerns, meaning that each part of the system should be responsible for a single task, and here the controller is actually responsible for fetching, refreshing, caching, and displaying everything. To solve this, we will describe how we separated the networking code into a class called NetworkRequestManager and the pagination logic into an abstraction called ListingNetworkSource. The ListingNetworkSource also handles the interaction with the model and store layers completing decoupling the controller from needing to work with them directly, a topic to discuss in depth in a future post. Finally, we will discuss how we built a flat hierarchy of view classes to create a feed which was simple and easily extensible. Separating the Network From the Controller The first chunk to break out of the FeedViewController is the networking code. We created a class called NetworkRequestManager which makes authenticated requests to the API through OAuth, and deserializes the JSON data. The networking manager can also handle things like prioritizing traffic or monitoring bad connectivity situations. This is a good start, but we can go further. At Reddit, it turns out that most of our API endpoints are lists. We have lists of posts, lists of subreddits, lists of comments, and more. In its JSON format, a listing contains an array of objects, and keys called “after” and “before” which allow you to get the next or previous batch of objects. We encapsulated all the functionality of fetching into something called ListingNetworkSource. It has methods to fetch data, fetch more data (with the after key), and methods which subclasses use to parse the data into posts or other objects. For example, we could create a subclass FeedListingNetworkSource to handle parsing the post objects of the main feed and different subclasses to handle other situations like comments or live threads. The super simplified version looks like this: @interface ListingNetworkSource : NSObject @property (nonatomic, weak, readwrite) NSObject *delegate; @property (nonatomic, copy, readwrite) NSArray *objects; @property (nonatomic, strong, readwrite) NSString *afterID; - (void)fetchData;- (void)fetchMoreData; // for subclasses to override- (void)parseData:(id)data;- (void)parseMoreData:(id)data; @end Loose Coupling Between The View Controller and Data Source Now we have a class that fetches data from the API. This is very powerful because we should be able to write our view controller code without worrying about listings at all. However, we still need to figure out the best way to connect the ListingNetworkSource to the FeedViewController. There are several approaches to connecting things in iOS apps. We could consider using Key-Value Observing and have the FeedViewController observe the objects on the network source. With KVO a method (observeValueForKeyPath) would get called every time the objects change. The updates are triggered immediately, which may not give us the control that we need with timing. Ideally we can do parsing and filtering of the data from a background thread and not block the UI. Finally, this wouldn’t give us the semantics of knowing how the data changed (fetching new data, fetching more data), only that the data needed to be reloaded. Another option would be to post a notification with NSNotificationCenter. This solves the thread safety issue for the most part, but it also limits the types of APIs we can build. Posting notifications is one-sided, so the posting class doesn’t receive any data back. This allows very minimal coupling, but the downside is that it can be difficult to follow the flow of the code since any object can observe the notifications. Furthermore, we wouldn’t be able to do filtering and parsing very easily with this technique since we can’t receive data back directly. Fortunately, there is another option: we can use delegation. Delegation allows us to maintain loose coupling between the controller and the network source, but also give both sides some flexibility. The ListingNetworkSource doesn’t need to know what the controller is doing, but it can ask the controller questions like whether to filter an object, or send a message to say that new data has been fetched. Another advantage of delegation is it is easy to extend with new functionality. When the requirement to filter NSFW posts from the main feed surfaced, it was as simple as adding a new delegate method: listingNetworkSourceShouldFilterObject. Here is a sample of the main parts of ListingNetworkSourceDelegate: @protocol ListingNetworkSourceDelegate <NSObject> - (void)listingNetworkSourceDidFetchData:(ListingNetworkSource *)listingNetworkSource;- (void)listingNetworkSourceDidFetchMoreData:(ListingNetworkSource *)listingNetworkSource;- (void)listingNetworkSourceDidFail:(ListingNetworkSource *)listingNetworkSource; @optional - (void)listingNetworkSourceDidParseNewData:(ListingNetworkSource *)listingNetworkSource; - (void)listingNetworkSourceDidStartFetching:(ListingNetworkSource *)listingNetworkSource; - (BOOL)listingNetworkSourceShouldFilterObject:(id)object; @end Putting It Together ListingNetworkSource created an abstraction for fetching lists of data from the API; now we need to figure out how to connect it to the front end of the app. We could implement the methods for ListingNetworkSourceDelegate directly in FeedViewController. In object-oriented programming there’s a common saying to favor composition over inheritance. The FeedViewController implements the protocol and gets the functionality of the network source through composition. The problem is that if we want to reuse the listing code for comments and subreddits we have to implement the same delegate methods there too. This leads to a lot of code duplication since all of these cases need the exact same fetching, pull-to-refresh, and reloading functionality. At the root of the class hierarchy we created BaseViewController as a subclass of UIViewController. In the base class, we implement core functionality such as screen view analytics and our customized navigation. For example, to allow the swipe gesture to pop back to the previous view controller from anywhere rather than only on the screen edge, we implemented a custom gesture recognizer in BaseViewController. On top of BaseViewController there is also code that is common to all listings which we implement in ListingViewController. First, the ListingViewController implements all of the delegate methods of ListingNetworkSource. Second, the controller handles general purpose functionality for displaying all types of listings such as pull to refresh and fetching more content when you are nearing the bottom of the feed. With this in place, everything you need to build a listing is given to subclasses for free, and all we need to set up in the our view controller classes is the unique UI for each different type of content. For example, FeedViewController implements the feed posts, while MessageListingViewController implements the feed for private messages. Building the UI To architect the user interface for the feed there were similar decisions to make. There are many different types of posts on Reddit such as links, self-posts, images (of cats), gifs, videos (of cats), and more (cats). Each post will be a row in the collection view for the feed, in other words a UICollectionViewCell. The most obvious approach is to make a UICollectionViewCell subclass for each type of post, but there are a couple of disadvantages to that approach. First, it would be nice to be able to reuse the post UI outside of a collection view. The solution is to create a simple wrapper cell, and put a regular UIView inside of it. This is a subtle distinction, but it makes the code more reusable for a little extra work. It’s also the case that there is a lot of reused UI in each type of post. They all have a title bar, for instance, so we can create a view called FeedPostTitleView. We also want to put a bar with the vote score and comment count on every item in the feed, so we can create a view called FeedPostCommentsBarView. Now we can create views for the individual types of postsFeedPostImageView, FeedPostVideoView, etc. Each of these serves a single purpose now, so they can just be plain UIViews as well. Building this way, the hierarchy of classes is very flat, yet we get maximum reusability as well. Simple Optimizations To Feed Performance After the first release we received numerous questions about how we achieved such good performance for the feed in the initial version of the app. One option is to integrate a library like Texture (formerly AsyncDisplayKit) or Facebook Component Kit to make the feed perform well. However, it is non-trivial to build the feed based on those open source framework due to our own Reddit specific challenges (apart even from licensing challenges). We always prefer the simple solution first. Instead of locking ourselves into dependencies, this lets us iterate fast and is easier for new hires. With that said, after a few caching and layout optimizations the performance is good enough. The Reddit feed is laid out entirely with the old-school technique of calculating frames and caching cell heights manually. Each item in the feed implements a class method +(CGSize)calculateSizeWithData:(id)data, which takes the data for the item and returns the size at which it should be displayed. We call this method from a background thread before the items are even displayed on screen and cache any expensive parts of the calculation. We do this because the collection view height methods are always called while scrolling, so by precalculating the height we assure no expensive calculations will be run on the main thread. To be specific, for laying out text we have a class TextHeightCache which, given a font and a string and a layout width, returns the height of the text. For images, there are some additional optimizations. Apart from using AFNetworking, which handles the image downloading, NSURL file caching and in-memory cache of decoded images, we also make sure to select the optimal image for the screen size and ensure that image decoding is done off the main thread. By keeping the layout code simple, exercising caching, and keeping the main thread unblocked as much as possible, we found that we were able to achieve 60 frames per second. Summary When we set out to build this product we knew it was not an MVP; we were confident that millions of Reddit’s 250+ million monthly visitors would download the app and try it. Since the most essential functionality of the app is its feeds, we worked hard to build a flexible yet not complicated feed architecture and create building blocks that could be reused throughout the app. Finally, it’s often said that you only get one chance to make a first impression, so we worked hard to optimize performance in simple ways. It is important to note that we intentionally keep the iOS team at a small size to enable high velocity and strong collaboration. As we hire more and support more product verticals in the app, new challenges will surface. At Reddit, we are currently looking for people who are interested in this level of challenge, so if you are one of them, please reach out to us."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/whats-new-on-reddit-gifts-arbitrary-day-the-mlb-prequel-memes-game-of-thrones","date":"2017-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"What’s New on Reddit Gifts: Arbitrary Day, the MLB, Prequel Memes, & Game of Thrones","text":"Reddit Gifts isn’t just about Secret Santa; we’re swinging into June with awesome gift exchanges to get you through all the summer months!

Every engineer writes code, gets it reviewed, checks it in, and rolls it out to production regularly. This happens as often as 200 times each week and a deploy usually takes fewer than 10 minutes end-to-end. The system that powers all of this has evolved over the years. Let’s take a look at how it’s changed (and how it hasn’t) over all that time. Where this story starts: consistent and repeatable deploys (2007-2010) The seed of the current system was a Perl script called push. It was written at a time very different from now in Reddit’s history. The entire engineering team was small enough to fit in one small conference room. Reddit was not yet on AWS. The site ran on a fixed number of servers, with additional capacity having to be added manually, and was comprised of one large monolithic Python application called r2. One thing that hasn’t changed over the years is that requests are classified at the load balancer and assigned to specific “pools” of otherwise identical application servers. For example, listing and comment pages are served from separate pools of servers. While any given r2 process could handle any kind of request, individual pools are isolated from spikes of traffic to other pools and can fail independently when they have different dependencies. The push tool had a hard-coded list of servers in it and was built around the monolith’s deploy process. It would iterate through all the application servers, SSH into the machine, run a pre-set sequence of commands to update the copy of code on the server via git, then restart all the application processes. In essence (heavily distilled, not real code): # build the static files and put them on the static server `make -C /home/reddit/reddit static` `rsync /home/reddit/reddit/static public:/var/www/` # iterate through the app servers and update their copy # of the code, restarting once done. foreach $h (@hostlist) { `git push $h:/home/reddit/reddit master` `ssh $h make -C /home/reddit/reddit` `ssh $h /bin/restart-reddit.sh` } The deploy was sequential. It worked its way through servers one by one. As simple as that sounds, this was actually a good thing: it allowed for a form of canary deploy. If you deployed to a few servers and noticed a new exception popping up, you’d know that you introduced a bug and could abort (Ctrl-C) and revert before affecting all requests. Because of the ease of deploys, it was easy to try things out in production and low friction to revert if it didn’t work out. It also meant it was necessary to do only one deploy at a time to ensure that new errors were from your deploy and not that other one so it was easier to know when and what to revert. This was all great for ensuring that deploys were consistent and repeatable. It ran pretty quickly. Things were good. A bunch of new people (2011) Then we hired a bunch, growing to six whole engineers, and now fit into a somewhat larger conference room. We started to feel a need for better coordination around deploys, particularly when individuals were working from home. We modified the push tool to announce when deploys started and ended via an IRC chatbot. The bot just sat in IRC and announced events. The process for actually doing the deploy looked the same, but now the system did the work for you and told everyone what you were doing. This was the beginning of us using chat for deployment workflows. There was a lot of talk of systems that managed deploys from chat around this time, but since we used third party IRC servers we weren’t able to fully trust the chat room with production control and so it remained a one-way flow of information. As traffic to the site grew, so did the infrastructure supporting it. We’d occasionally have to launch a new batch of application servers and put them into service. This was still a very manual process, including updating the list of hosts in push. When we added capacity we would usually grow a pool by several servers at a time. The result of this was that iterating through the list of servers sequentially would touch multiple servers in the same pool in quick succession rather than a diverse mix. We used uWSGI to manage worker processes and so when we told the application to restart it would kill the existing processes and spin up new ones. The new ones took some time to get ready to serve requests and, combined with incidentally targeting a single pool at a time, this would impact the capacity of that pool to serve requests. So we were limited in the rate we could safely deploy to servers. As the list of servers grew, so did the length of the deploys. A reworked deploy tool (2012) We did an overhaul on the deploy tool, written in Python now, confusingly also called push. The new version had a few major improvements. First, it fetched its list of hosts from DNS rather than keeping it hard-coded. This allowed us to update the list of hosts without having to remember to update the deploy tool as well — a rudimentary service discovery system. To help the issue of sequential restarts, we shuffled the list of hosts before deploying. Because this would mix up the pools of servers, it allowed us to safely roll through at higher speed and so deploy faster. The initial implementation just shuffled randomly each time, but this made it hard to quickly revert code because you wouldn’t deploy to the same first few servers each time. So we amended the shuffle to use a seed that could be re-used on a second deploy when reverting. Another small but important change was to always deploy a fixed version of the code. The previous version of the tool would update master on a given host, but what if master changed mid-deploy because someone accidentally pushed up code? By deploying a specific git revision instead of branch name, we ensured that the deploy got the same version everywhere in production. Finally, the new tool made a distinction between its code (focused on lists of hosts and SSHing into them) and the commands being run. It was still heavily biased by r2’s needs, but it had a proto-API of sorts. This allowed r2 to control its own deploy steps which made it easier to roll out changes to the build and release flow. For example, here’s what might have run on an individual server. The exact commands were hidden but the sequence was still specific to r2’s workflow: sudo /opt/reddit/deploy.py fetch reddit sudo /opt/reddit/deploy.py deploy reddit f3bbbd66a6 sudo /opt/reddit/deploy.py fetch-names sudo /opt/reddit/deploy.py restart all That fetch-names thing was very much an r2-only concern! The autoscaler (2013) Then we decided to actually get with the cloud thing and autoscale (a subject for a separate blog post). This allowed us to save a ton of money when the site was less busy and automatically grow to keep up with unexpected demand. The previous improvements that automatically fetched the hostlist from DNS made this a natural transition. The hostlist changed a lot more often than before, but it was no different to the tool. What started out as a quality of life thing became integral to being able to launch the autoscaler. However, autoscaling did bring up some interesting edge cases. No free lunches. What happens if a server is launched while a deploy is ongoing? We had to make sure each newly launched server checked in to get new code if present. What about servers going away mid-deploy? The tool had to be made smarter to detect when the server was gone legitimately rather than there being an issue with the deploy process itself that should be noisily alerted on. Incidentally, we also switched from uWSGI to Gunicorn around this time for various reasons. This didn’t really make a difference as far as deploys are concerned. So things carried on. Too many servers (2014) Over time, the number of servers needed to serve peak traffic grew. This meant that deploys took longer and longer. At its worst, a normal deploy took close to an hour. This was not good. We rewrote the deploy tool to handle hosts in parallel. The new version is called rollingpin. A lot of the time the old tool took was initiating ssh connections and waiting for commands to finish, so parallelizing at a safe amount allowed for faster deploys. This instantly took the deploy time down to 5 minutes again. To reduce the impact of restarting multiple servers at once, the deploy tool’s shuffle got smarter. Instead of blindly shuffling the list of servers, it would interleave pools of servers in a way that maximally separated servers from each pool. A much more intentional reduction of impact on the site. The most important change of the new tool was that the API between the deploy tool and the tool that lived on each server was much more clearly defined and decoupled from r2’s needs. This was originally done with an eye to being more open source-friendly, but it ended up being very useful shortly after. Here’s an example of a deploy, with the highlighted commands being the API executed remotely. Too many people (2015) Suddenly, it seemed, there were a lot of people working on r2 at once. This was great and meant more deploys. Keeping to the one deploy at a time rule slowly became more difficult with individual engineers having to coordinate verbally about which order they would release code in. To fix this, we added another feature to the chatbot which coordinated a queue of deploys. Engineers would ask for the deploy lock and either get it or get put in the queue. This helped keep order in deploys and let people relax a bit while waiting for the lock. Another important addition as the team grew was to track deploys in a central location. We modified the deploy tool to send a metric to Graphite so it was easy to correlate deploys to changes in metrics. Two (many) services (2015 also) And just as suddenly we had a second service coming online. The new mobile version of the website was coming online. It was a completely different stack and had its own servers and build process. This was the first real test of the deploy tool’s decoupled API. With the addition of the ability to do build steps in different locations for each project, it held up and we were able to manage both services under the same system. 25 many services (2016) Over the course of the next year, we saw explosive growth in the Reddit team. We went from those two services to a couple dozen and from two teams to fifteen. The majority of our services are either built on Baseplate, our backend service framework, or node applications similar to mobile web. The deploy infrastructure is common to all of them and more are coming online soon because rollingpin doesn’t care what it’s deploying. This makes it easy to spin up new services with tools that people are familiar with. The safety net (2017) With the increased number of servers dedicated to the monolith, the deploy time grew. We wanted to deploy with a high parallel count but doing so would have caused too many simultaneous restarts to the app servers. Hence, we were below capacity and unable to serve incoming requests, overloading other app servers. Gunicorn’s main process used the same model as uWSGI and would restart all workers at once. While the new worker processes are booting, you are unable to serve any requests. The startup time of our monolith ranged from 10-30 seconds which meant during that period we would be unable to serve any requests. To work around this, we replaced the gunicorn master process with Stripe’s worker manager Einhorn, while keeping gunicorn’s HTTP stack and WSGI container. Einhorn restarts worker processes by spawning one new worker, waiting for it to declare itself ready, then reaping an old worker, and repeating until all are upgraded. This created a safety net and allowed us to be at capacity during a deploy. This new model introduced a different problem. As mentioned earlier, it could take up to 30 seconds for a worker to be replaced and booted up. This meant that if your code had a bug, it wouldn’t surface right away and you could roll through a lot of servers. To prevent that, we introduced a way to block the deploy from moving on to another server until all the worker process had been restarted. This was done by simply polling einhorn’s state and waiting until all new workers are ready. To keep up speed, we just increased the parallelism, which was now safe to do. This new mechanism allows us to deploy to a lot more machines concurrently, and deploy timings are down to 7 minutes for around 800 servers despite the extra waiting for safety. In retrospect This deploy infrastructure is the product of many years of stepwise improvements rather than any single large dedicated effort. Shades of history and tradeoffs taken at each step are visible in the current system and at any point in the past. There are pros and cons to such an evolutionary approach: it’s less effort at any given time, but we may end up in a dead end. It’s important to keep an eye on where you are evolving to so that you keep moving in a useful direction. The future Reddit’s infrastructure needs to support the team as it grows and constantly builds new things. The rate of growth of the company is the highest it’s ever been in Reddit’s history, and we’re working on bigger more interesting projects than ever before. The big issues facing us today are twofold: improving engineer autonomy while maintaining system security in the production infrastructure, and evolving a safety net for engineers to deploy quickly with confidence.

The result was “HQG Studios,” which has since evolved from a brilliant, one-off project to a Reddit institution highlighting the originality, irreverence, and team spirit of one of our favorite communities: r/HighQualityGifs. Play, Play, Play… On October 3, r/HighQualityGifs moderator extraordinaire u/hero0fwar debuted HQG Studios, a collective he formed with other all-star contributors to the subreddit, who joined forces to take on something a bit outside the scope of a single gif. “I got the idea a couple of years ago here,” he writes, “always wanted to do a full music video with fun lyrics done instead of that boring black screen lyric video everyone is used to, but doing a full video yourself can be extremely tedious. “Then a year or so later I ran into this YouTube video and got the idea to bring others on board. I threw the idea out to a couple of guys and the next thing you know we have 18 of us working on the Swift video.” The plan was simple: take the official video for Taylor Swift’s song “Shake It Off,” divvy it up among a few talented volunteers, give each gif-maker artistic freedom to put a unique spin on their assigned section, and put all the pieces together into one fluid series of high-quality gifs, colloquially known as a “video.” The execution, however, was anything but easy. For the first project, 17 gif-makers were working simultaneously on their respective sections, each spending several days creating their piece of the video. Once they edited their gifs together (with direction from u/hero0fwar), the finished result was a fascinating passion project that showcased the editing skills and sometimes random imagination of its creators. You can view highlights from the final video below: What People Say The response to the first HQG Studios release was overwhelmingly positive, with almost 900 comments, over 16,000 upvotes, and the true mark of success in r/HighQualityGifs: other posts referencing the original. Two days later, u/hero0fwar created a new subreddit, r/HQGStudios, proof that their creative endeavor was here to stay. The next video the team gave the HQG treatment was Mackelmore’s “Thrift Shop,” which presented new editing challenges that the monochromatic backgrounds and sparse sets of “Shake It Off” didn’t. It begins with Macklemore and company cycling into a sign for HQG Studios, a well-placed tattoo reading “MEME LIFE,” and an appropriately meta nod to their last video. When u/hero0fwar shared the finished product, redditors gave it a similarly enthusiastic reception, but this time the HQG team caught the eye of Dahlia Dandashi at The Daily Dot, who wrote, “Macklemore’s ‘Thrift Shop’ is way better in GIF form.” You can watch the full video below and judge for yourself: Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop So far this year, the HQG Studios team has followed up with two more lyric videos—the Bruno Mars song “24k Magic” in March, the long-awaited Swift sequel “Bad Blood” in April, and Eminem’s “Rap God” earlier this month. But they’ve also ventured outside the realm of music videos, with their take on the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 and more creative productions in the works. “I would love to see this project get in front of some mainstream companies,” u/hero0fwar explains. “I have already had some contact with a couple of record labels, but it has not evolved into any projects yet…” In the meantime, HQG Studios will keep giffing, and they likely can’t or simply won’t stop adding meta. It’s like they’ve got these movies, in their minds… For for the latest HQG productions, check out r/HQGStudios.

Up to this point, vote score and number of comments were the main indicators of activity on a given post. However, Reddit has many visitors that consume content without voting or commenting. We wanted to build a system that could capture this activity by counting the number of views a post received. This number is then shown to content creators and moderators to provide them better insight into the activity on specific posts. In this post, we’re going to talk about how we implemented counting at scale. Counting Methodology We had four main requirements for counting views: Counts must be real time or near-real time. No daily or hourly aggregates.Each user must only be counted once within a short time window.The displayed count must be within a few percentage points of the actual tally.The system must be able to run at production scale and process events within a few seconds of their occurrence. Satisfying all four of these requirements is trickier than it sounds. In order to maintain an exact count in real time we would need to know whether or not a specific user visited the post before. To know that information, we would need to store the set of users who had previously visited each post, and then check that set every time we processed a new view on a post. A naive implementation of this solution would be to store the unique user set as a hash table in memory, with the post ID as the key. This approach works well for less trafficked posts, but is very difficult to scale once a post becomes popular and the number of viewers rapidly increases. Several popular posts have over one million unique viewers! On posts like these, it becomes extremely taxing on both memory and CPU to store all the IDs and do frequent lookups into the set to see if someone has already visited before. Since we could not provide exact counts, we looked at a few different cardinality estimation algorithms. We considered two options that closely matched what we were looking to accomplish: A linear probabilistic counting approach, which is very accurate, but requires linearly more memory as the set being counted gets larger.A HyperLogLog (HLL)-based counting approach. HLLs grow sub-linearly with set size, but do not provide the same level of accuracy as linear counters. For an understanding of just how much space HLLs really save, consider the r/pics post included at the top of this blog post. It received over 1 million unique users. If we had to store 1 million unique user IDs, and each user ID is an 8-byte long, then we would require 8 megabytes of memory just to count the unique users for a single post! In contrast, using an HLL for counting would take significantly less memory. The amount of memory varies per implementation, but in the case of this implementation, we could count over 1 million IDs using just 12 kilobytes of space, which would be 0.15% of the original space usage! (This article on High Scalability has a good overview of both of the above algorithms.) Many HLL implementations use a combination of the above two approaches, by starting with linear counting for small sets and switching over to HLL once the size reaches a certain point. The former is frequently referred to as a “sparse” HLL representation, while the latter is referred to as a “dense” HLL representation. The hybrid approach is very advantageous, because it can provide accurate results for both small sets and large sets while retaining a modest memory footprint. This approach is described in more detail in Google’s HyperLogLog++ paper. While the HLL algorithm is fairly standard, there were three variants we considered using in our implementation. Note that for in-memory HLL implementations, we only looked at Java and Scala implementations as we primarily use Java and Scala on the data engineering team. Twitter’s Algebird library, implemented in Scala. Algebird has good usage docs, but the implementation details of the sparse and dense HLL representations were not easily understandable.An implementation of HyperLogLog++ located in stream-lib, implemented in Java. The code in stream-lib is very well-documented, but it was somewhat difficult to understand how to use the library properly and tune it to our needs.Redis’s HLL implementation (which we chose). We felt that the Redis implementation of HLLs were well-documented and easily configurable, and the HLL-related APIs provided were easy to integrate. As an added benefit, using Redis alleviated many of our performance concerns by taking the CPU and memory-intensive portion of the counting application (HLL computations) out and moving that onto a dedicated server. Reddit’s data pipeline is primarily oriented around Apache Kafka. When a user views a post, an event gets fired and sent to an event collector server, which batches the events and persists them into Kafka. From here, the view-counting system has two components which operate sequentially. The first part of our counting architecture is a Kafka consumer called Nazar, which will read each event from Kafka and pass it through a set of rules we’ve concocted to determine whether or not an event should be counted. We gave it this name because just as a nazar is an eye-shaped amulet protecting you from evil, the Nazar system is an “eye” that protects us from bad actors trying to game the system. Nazar uses Redis to maintain state and keep track of potential reasons why a view should not be counted. One reason we may not count an event is if it’s the result of repeat views from the same user over a short period of time. Nazar will then alter the event, adding a Boolean flag indicating whether or not it should be counted, before sending the event back to Kafka. This is where the second part of the project picks up. We have a second Kafka consumer called Abacus, which does the actual counting of views and makes the counts available for the site or clients to display. Abacus reads the events from Kafka that were output by Nazar; then, depending on Nazar’s determination, it either counts or skips over the view. If the event is marked for counting, then Abacus first checks if there is an HLL counter already existing in Redis for the post corresponding to the event. If the counter is already in Redis, then Abacus makes a PFADD request to Redis for that post. If the counter is not already in Redis, then Abacus makes a request to a Cassandra cluster, which we use to persist both the HLL counters and the raw count numbers, and makes a SET request into Redis to add the filter. This usually happens when people view older posts whose counters have been evicted from Redis. In order to allow for maintaining counts on older posts that might have been evicted from Redis, Abacus periodically writes out both the full HLL filter from Redis along with the count for each post to a Cassandra cluster. Writes to Cassandra are batched in 10-second groups per post in order to avoid overloading the cluster. Below is a diagram outlining this event flow at a high level. Conclusion We hope that view counts will better enable content creators to understand the full reach of their posts, and help moderators to quickly identify which posts are receiving large amounts of traffic in their communities. In the future, we plan to leverage the real-time potential of our data pipeline to deliver more useful feedback to redditors.

DMN homepage and social producer Nicholas Friedman explained the intent behind the series and the outlet’s recently launched profile on Reddit. “As a longtime Reddit user, I’ve been thinking for a while now about ways to bring together the community and readership we have at The Dallas Morning News with the open community of a platform like Reddit,” he wrote. “With the marketing team, members of the Audience Team here and reps from Reddit, we were able to make that a reality, proving that the platform could be key in how we look at and interact with news.” You can read Wilson’s full AMA here and Moroney’s here.

As a Community Manager at Reddit (one of the many roles lumped into the “admin” title on the site), I get asked a lot of questions about my job. Most of the time, it’s questions about specific communities (usually ones getting attention for causing trouble), but I also get asked often what my my day-to-day is like, and what a Community Manager actually does. Once people find out that my background is in anthropology, the very next question is almost always “Why anthropology?” During a recent radio interview, I was asked a new question: “Are there other anthropologists working in your field?” This gave me pause. After all, I’d spent the prior few minutes (and months, and years) expounding on why anthropology and community management are like two peas in a pod! And now, I had to admit that most community managers I’ve met (with the exception of the ones here at Reddit and a few other community content-driven sites) came from marketing backgrounds. Few had training in social sciences, and I had yet to meet any that had a background similar to mine. Anthropology is often thought of as a stodgy discipline: leather armchairs, sepia-toned pictures (without the need for an Instagram filter), old men with fancy facial hair, and tromps through faraway lands to study an exotic culture, writing a book that will sit on a library shelf collecting dust until some unassuming undergrad needs just one more source for an assignment. But honestly, anthropology is now, and has always been, so much more. We’re studying Anonymous, NASCAR, and World of Warcraft. We’ve worked in big tech and market research, among other fields. If you enjoy your yogurt in a portable container, you can thank an anthropologist for that (look me up if you want the story; it’s amazing). Anthropology is endlessly flexible and adaptable to any field. “Community” is a term often tossed about with great abandon, especially in startup culture. So if anthropology is so nifty and keen, and isn’t all those other things, what is it? The tl;dr is that it’s the study of humans (anthro meaning “human” and –ology meaning “study of). Each field of anthropology has its focus; cultural (or social) anthropology, which is my main area, focuses on human culture in all its forms. For some of us, it means the traditional idea of going to a different country and living with the people there. For some of us, though, it’s communities closer to home. “Community” is a term often tossed about with great abandon, especially in startup culture. It’s sometimes interchanged with “network,” but in the end, everyone means the same thing: a group of individuals gathered together who share certain characteristics or interests. Those interests could be a specific fandom, an affection for driving others around in a personal car, completing tasks for a set fee, or any other of the many types of communities on the internet right now. With the growth in the so-called “gig economy,” groups of people forming together online will continue to be big business in this sector, for good or for ill. Companies in the “gig economy,” organizations with more “traditional” types of communities like Wikipedia and Reddit, and sometimes brands that utilize social media in their advertising and marketing campaigns generally employ community managers to keep track of their communities or networks. This work entails interfacing with the community, ensuring that their needs are met, providing support, and voicing the issues and concerns of that community to the company at large. These jobs require a fairly unique blend of skills: part PR, part customer service, part marketing, not to mention part community confidante, among others. One that isn’t often brought up, though, is researcher. Online community managers are well served by being the #1 experts in their community, how it functions, and even how it forms itself into a working collective. To do this, online community managers must be willing to do in-depth research into their respective communities. Without good, grounded ideas as to who your community is, what they want, and how they function, you can’t be an effective community manager. Most community managers I have met in my 15+ years in the field have come from a background of marketing (for those who manage communities on social media, this is key), customer service, or other business-related field. While all of those fields can provide the bulk of the skills needed to be good community managers, it is anthropology that holds a key in tying all of these threads together for effective community management. Anthropology helps give you the tools needed for in-depth research into a community (or, dare I say, culture) and make sense of what you’re seeing. While this may not be “fieldwork” in the traditional sense of going into a foreign culture and living in it for long periods of time, it is still fieldwork and the work that comes out of it can be ethnography (basically, this is kind of the end result of fieldwork; the write-up of what was observed and concluded). Without good, grounded ideas as to who your community is, what they want, and how they function, you can’t be an effective community manager. For instance, recently those of us on the Community Team here at Reddit became interested in what makes a community “healthy” versus “unhealthy.” It was something we’d talked to mods about, and we wanted to get some appreciation for how it looked on the ground. When we first started kicking the project around, a lot of quantitative measures (aka hard numbers) were getting tossed about: number of pageviews, number of subscribers, number of comments, number of posts… you get the idea. Things that were easy to count, but really had very little to do with health. You can have a community getting a ton of pageviews and activity, but it’s because there’s a lot of drama and trolling festering inside and making the community an unpleasant place to be. Or, you could have a very low-volume community that’s chugging along peacefully and very healthily. Of course, the converse of both of these could also be true, hence why these numbers really aren’t the end-all-be-all in figuring out health. So, several of us sat down and brainstormed the things that we’d seen in healthy and unhealthy communities we had experience with (both on and off Reddit), as well as other ideas our mods had told us. Before long, we had a rubric of things to look for in communities. This was not a “healthy community checklist”; instead, it was a list of items to observe. For instance: Are the mods active in the community? What did that look like? Did the community and the mod team seem to get along? Did they stand up for each other? How do they deal with trolls? Was the community there truly to engage with content and/or each other, or just to consume content? … having this background has certainly helped me formulate research plans and make sense of results quicker and, I feel, with a more holistic view of the entire project overall than I did before when I was doing this work without anthropology. I want to stress again, none of these items was seen as a strict marker of health (or lack of health). Instead, we wanted to get a broad, holistic picture of each community and see where this led us. In other words, we were conducting a rapid ethnographic assessment (I like to call them “flash ethnographies” because it sounds more exciting): a quick gathering of ethnographic data. From this, we can start to look at our data and see patterns of healthy communities, so we can help new mods (and existing ones, too!) create and maintain healthy communities on Reddit. Those of you who are reading this and are versed in anthropology may be scratching your heads at this point. After all, anthropology isn’t about defining health or function; it’s about observation and study. However, I would argue that this piece is what takes anthropology and makes it applied. As applied anthropologists, we can take our observations to our managers and higher-ups, but those observations on their faces aren’t going to mean much to them. Imagine if I went to u/spez with a list of things we’d observed in all those subreddits. He’d tell me, “That’s great. What does it mean for us?” That’s where application comes in: I can tell him how these are markers of health, what that means, and what we can do to foster that in more communities. While this sounds very cut and dry, that doesn’t mean I’m not utilizing a lot of anthropological theory in my day-to-day, so if you’re an anthropology student out there thinking you can ditch your theory classes, think again. While I, personally, may not trade in cultural hegemony or structural functionalism on a regular basis (thank heavens), I do have several ideas that form the basis of what I do, including social capital and communitas. If you’re into community management and/or anthropology, I highly recommend you get familiar with those terms and learn how they can work for you. None of this is to say that if you don’t have this same background you can’t do this type of research or understand your results. But having this background has certainly helped me formulate research plans and make sense of results quicker and, I feel, with a more holistic view of the entire project overall than I did before when I was doing this work without anthropology. Having ideas to ground and focus in, along with experience in creating research plans, is a boost for my productivity and helps my end results be clearer. I’ve spent this whole post making the case for anthropology in community management, but there are a host of other places where anthropology is a huge boon. UX design/research is huge for anthropology and the social sciences in general. While not only trying to determine how users will interface with a product, the research piece talks to users about how they would interface with a product and use it, an important thing to determine as sometimes the way a user will use a function vs. how it was designed are entirely different things. Business development could use more anthropologists, too. After all, how can you make the best deals and partnerships for your communities if you don’t understand them? Even developers and engineers can find it useful, since anthropology is about the humans they are creating features and tools for. In the end, I really see my job as being the person at the table who always remembers the human, seeing the user on the other side of the screen. That person could be coming to Reddit to fangirl over their favorite TV show, to celebrate their team’s victory, or to find comfort after a rough time. Reddit is this and more to so many people, and preserving that is very important to all of us. We have to remember their needs, YOUR needs, at the end of the day, otherwise all those features and tools, designs and uses, deals and partnerships, are all for naught.

The Daily Dot caught up with Cady in the middle of a four-day AMA IRL series at SXSW, broadcast and co-hosted by our friends at Twitch. The event, sponsored by the Sony Pictures film Life, featured live performances, gaming, interviews, and AMAs across a range of Reddit communities. The Mayor of Austin joined Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in kicking off the first day of the stream before diving into an AMA in r/politics. Over the next 96 hours, the lineup (both on-stage and on the platform) included Rogue One director Gareth Edwards, Entourage star Adrian Grenier, hip-hop legends Just Blaze and Grandmaster Flash, DJ San Holo, the hosts of Pod Save America, and NPR’s Tiny Desk Contest winner Gaelynn Lea. “The foundation of our concept,” Cady explains, “married Reddit’s Ask Me Anything crowd-sourced interview format with Twitch’s chat-enabled live streaming broadcasting from a main stage—around which we built a 4-day event highlighting the passions of a variety of Reddit’s wide swath of communities from r/VirtualReality to r/Yoga to r/HipHopHeads to r/SciFi.” The IRL event marks just one example of Reddit’s recent advertising initiatives, including a redesigned self-serve advertising platform last month and a slew of key product updates. “Reddit has been experimenting with impact. This was a proof of concept for the immense power of what is possible when ‘Reddit shows up’ in the real world,” Cady says. “As Reddit has evolved over the past decade, it’s become the home for some of the best self-expression on the Internet. Cathartic testimonials, epic paintings, crowd-sourced film projects. The very beginning of our ads framework about half a decade ago, the Promoted Post, enabled some of the best self-promotion on the web—whether turning bedroom albums into record deals or launching kitchen table start-ups. “One of our core values at Reddit is to ‘remember the human’ and another is to ‘evolve.’ That frames the approach we’re taking to the ads industry.

This past Saturday, that comment became a reality as 600 cities around the world participated in the March for Science. In the lead-up to the event, many users from Reddit’s vast Science communities contributed to the organization of the March through the r/MarchForScience subreddit and AMAs with the national March organizers and Honorary Co-Chair Bill Nye. And ICYMI, over the weekend, news outlets like Mic, Quartz, and VICE News covered the Reddit origins of the March for Science. The Washington Post even interviewed u/beaverteeth92. Of course, for those of you who remember your Reddit history, the March for Science isn’t the first march to go from a casual post to Washington, DC. Back in 2010, u/mrsammercer had an unshakeable vision for Colbert to hold a satirical rally, which soon became the “fear” side of the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. Given this historical precedent, we wanted to mark the occasion of the second large-scale, Reddit-inspired march by doing a quick recap of users’ posts from Saturday. Some redditors shared photos of the turnout at their local marches: A few redditors shared sightings of some familiar celebrities at the March: (The most common sighting, however, was neither a MythBuster nor a Science Guy, but a man named Rick Sanchez, who appeared simultaneously in Chicago, DC, and London.) As the day went on, we saw hundreds of subreddits participating in the March in their own unique ways, regardless of their usual community focus.

Because each user could only place one tile every five minutes, any single individual would have struggled to create a meaningful image on their own. However, through community collaboration, users quickly produced complex creations, surpassing all of our expectations about how this project would turn out once the 72 hours were up. As with our previous April Fools’ projects The Button and Robin, Place was created to explore human interaction at scale. Because of their experiential (and temporal) nature, adequately summarizing these projects is always a challenge (though the fact that Place has a visual artifact does make this a little easier). Last week, we shared the technical story behind r/Place, so today we wanted to share a (very incomplete) collection of some of the amazing creativity that emerged from Place. We encourage you all to share your favorite moments in the comments. We have also released a complete dataset of Place data and are looking forward to seeing what emerges on r/dataisbeautiful. What Is This Place? If you have no idea what you’re reading right now, don’t worry, redditors have got you covered with a variety of summaries for you to dive into. For starters, you can read the Place announcement post, visit r/place, and explore the canvas for yourself.If you want to relive the experience as it unfolded, u/mud_born started documenting Place in a comment on the announcement post and kept this up for the full 72 hours, providing updates as the canvas evolved. You can read the full saga here.And for the more visually inclined amongst you, YouTube has r/place: an Incomplete History, A Short History of Place, and timelapses galore. If you are wondering what all the images and iconography plastered across Place are, you may want to visit u/draemmli’s Place Atlas. The community-sourced, interactive map provides information and metadata about the different images that make up the final version of Place. Surely This Will Not End Well… Providing an empty canvas to millions of anonymous internet users? What could possibly go wrong? We knew there was an inherent risk to Place, but our previous projects have taught us to assume the best of the Reddit community. Fun outweighs fear. Part of the success of Place was due to the expectation that it would be largely self-policed. We thought that for every one person that wanted to do something negative, there would be thousands that wanted to overwrite that with something positive—and we were right. It turns out collaborating to make something bad is far harder than collaborating to make something good. Factions, Alliances, & Destruction Soon after it launched, redditors within and across different communities were working together (and sometimes against one another) to create upon the canvas. Collaboration was compelling. Countries staked their claim in Place, with geographical rivalries emerging. The European contingent had its share of scuffles but eventually arrived at a harmonious equilibrium. Redditors’ national pride was evident throughout. Dutch users were more likely to place orange tiles, Australians loved green and yellow, and Germans efficiently stuck to black, yellow, and red. The color preferences of each of the top 100 countries in Place can be found in the Place dataset. With so many factions and alliances, it’s hardly surprising to see hotspots wax and wane. Despite a number of tiles remaining untouched throughout, many tiles more closely resembled battlegrounds. The bottom-right corner, for example, switched colors 37,214 times by 23,798 unique users, as r/TheBlueCorner valiantly held on (including the final blue tile by u/NotZaphodBeeblebrox). Meanwhile, factions like r/theblackvoid sought to remind everyone why destruction is a necessary part of creation. u/theivoryserf shares their thoughts on the matter. However, not all groups pursued destruction. r/ainbowroad spread around the canvas quickly, working with other factions to create something more: Data Reddit is at its best when ideas and insights are being shared and remixed. We deliberately build these projects to be accessible to curious developers. Redditors like u/mncke captured Place data in realtime and provided it for use by communities like r/placedevs. A popular usage was displaying the placement data in a heatmap that highlighted the most active areas of the Place canvas. u/Lucas7yoshi shared details of a Minecraft server that was tracking these changes in 3D. u/jampekka created an awesome timelapse heatmap of place. u/FLYING_HOOHAW took a similar idea and created a fictitious show’s opening credits: u/d416 created a series of 3D tilt-shift images from the data. u/Physics_Dude went one step further and printed a topographical heatmap on their 3D printer. If you’d like to explore the data, you can find the full dataset here. Aftermath After 72 hours Place ended but the creativity continued. u/sudoscript penned the much-shared blog post When Pixels Collide, that retells the story of Place:… at its core, the story of Place is an eternal story, about the three forces that humanity needs to make art, creation, and technology possible. u/scharkfin also wrote a memorable comment, reflecting on Place’s short life. Some alliances have even gone as far as to write the history of place from their perspective., as in u/jojo6311’s “Tale of the Great Green Lattice.” Beyond written histories, redditors have been creating physical objects to remember Place by. u/onji had the best idea ever and u/awkwardatbest made it a reality: Even now, two weeks after Place has ended, redditors are remembering Place in different ways. The community at r/thefinalclean has erased any ‘errant’ pixels from the final Place canvas. r/placenostalgia is gathering their favorite Place moments. And we’re still waiting for u/bro_just404it to honor their bamboozle-free promise. And Finally The depth of projects like Place is only achievable because of the creativity and collaborative nature of the Reddit community. We created a canvas for you to draw anything on and you did not disappoint. From everyone at Reddit HQ, thank you. Share your favorite moments from Place in the comments.

This year we came up with Place, a collaborative canvas on which a single user could only place a single tile every five minutes. This limitation de-emphasized the importance of the individual and necessitated the collaboration of many users in order to achieve complex creations. Each tile placed was relayed to observers in real-time. Multiple engineering teams (frontend, backend, mobile) worked on the project and most of it was built using existing technology at Reddit. This post details how we approached building Place from a technical perspective. But first, if you want to check out the code for yourself, you can find it here. And if you’re interested in working on projects like Place in the future, we’re hiring! Requirements Defining requirements for an April Fools’ project is extremely important because it will launch with zero ramp-up and be available immediately to all of Reddit’s users. If it doesn’t work perfectly out of the gate, it’s unlikely to attract enough users to make for an interesting experience. The board must be 1000 tiles by 1000 tiles so it feels very large.All clients must be kept in sync with the same view of the current board state, otherwise users with different versions of the board will have difficulty collaborating.We should support at least 100,000 simultaneous users.Users can place one tile every 5 minutes, so we must support an average update rate of 100,000 tiles per 5 minutes (333 updates/s).The project must be designed in such a way that it’s unlikely to affect the rest of the site’s normal function even with very high traffic to r/place.The configuration must be flexible in case there are unexpected bottlenecks or failures. This means that board size and tile cooldown should be adjustable on the fly in case data sizes are too large or update rates are too high.The API should be generally open and transparent so the reddit community can build on it (bots, extensions, data collection, external visualizations, etc) if they choose to do so. Backend Implementation decisions The main challenge for the backend was keeping all the clients in sync with the state of the board. Our solution was to initialize the client state by having it listen for real-time tile placements immediately and then make a request for the full board. The full board in the response could be a few seconds stale as long as we also had real-time placements starting from before it was generated. When the client received the full board it replayed all the real-time placements it received while waiting. All subsequent tile placements could be drawn to the board immediately as they were received. For this scheme to work we needed the request for the full state of the board to be as fast as possible. Our initial approach was to store the full board in a single row in Cassandra and each request for the full board would read that entire row. The format for each column in the row was: (x, y): {‘timestamp’: epochms, ‘author’: user_name, ‘color’: color} Because the board contained 1 million tiles this meant that we had to read a row with 1 million columns. On our production cluster this read took up to 30 seconds, which was unacceptably slow and could have put excessive strain on Cassandra. Our next approach was to store the full board in redis. We used a bitfield of 1 million 4 bit integers. Each 4 bit integer was able to encode a 4 bit color, and the x,y coordinates were determined by the offset (offset = x + 1000y) within the bitfield. We could read the entire board state by reading the entire bitfield. We were able to update individual tiles by updating the value of the bitfield at a specific offset (no need for locking or read/modify/write). We still needed to store the full details in Cassandra so that users could inspect individual tiles to see who placed them and when. We also planned on using Cassandra to restore the board in case of a redis failure. Reading the entire board from redis took less than 100ms, which was fast enough. Illustration showing how colors were stored in redis, using a 2×2 board We were concerned about exceeding maximum read bandwidth on redis. If many clients connected or refreshed at once they would simultaneously request the full state of the board, all triggering reads from redis. Because the board was a shared global state the obvious solution was to use caching. We decided to cache at the CDN (Fastly) layer because it was simple to implement and it meant the cache was as close to clients as possible which would help response speed. Requests for the full state of the board were cached by Fastly with an expiration of 1 second. We also added the stale-while-revalidate cache control header option to prevent more requests from falling through than we wanted when the cached board expired. Fastly maintains around 33 POPs which do independent caching, so we expected to get at most 33 requests per second for the full board. We used our websocket service to publish updates to all the clients. We’ve had success using it in production for reddit live threads with over 100,000 simultaneous viewers, live PM notifications, and other features. The websocket service has also been a cornerstone of our past April Fools projects such as The Button and Robin. For r/place, clients maintained a websocket connection to receive real-time tile placement updates. APIRetrieve the full board Requests first went to Fastly. If there was an unexpired copy of the board it would be returned immediately without hitting the reddit application servers. Otherwise, if there was a cache miss or the copy was too old, the reddit application would read the full board from redis and return that to Fastly to be cached and returned to the client. Request rate and response time as measured by the reddit application Notice that the request rate never exceeds 33/s, meaning that the caching by Fastly was very effective at preventing most requests from hitting the reddit application. When a request did hit the reddit application the read from redis was very fast.Draw a tile The steps for drawing a tile were: Read the timestamp of the user’s last tile placement from Cassandra. If it was more recent than the cooldown period (5 minutes) reject the draw attempt and return an error to the user.Write the tile details to redis and Cassandra.Write the current timestamp as the user’s last tile placement in Cassandra.Tell the websocket service to send a message to all connected clients with the new tile. All reads and writes to Cassandra were done with consistency level QUORUM to ensure strong consistency. We actually had a race condition here that allowed users to place multiple tiles at once. There was no locking around the steps 1-3 so simultaneous tile draw attempts could all pass the check at step 1 and then draw multiple tiles at step 2. It seems that some users discovered this error or had bots that didn’t gracefully follow the ratelimits so there were about 15,000 tiles drawn that abused this error (~0.09% of all tiles placed). Request rate and response time as measured by the reddit application We experienced a maximum tile placement rate of almost 200/s. This was below our calculated maximum rate of 333/s (average of 100,000 users placing a tile every 5 minutes). Get details of a single tile Requests for individual tiles resulted in a read straight from Cassandra. Request rate and response time as measured by the reddit application: This endpoint was very popular. In addition to regular client requests, people wrote scrapers to retrieve the entire board one tile at a time. Since this endpoint wasn’t cached by the CDN, all requests ended up being served by the reddit application. Response times for these requests were pretty fast and stable throughout the project. Websockets We don’t have isolated metrics for r/place’s effect on the websocket service, but we can estimate and subtract the baseline use from the values before the project started and after it ended. Total connections to the websocket service The baseline before r/place began was around 20,000 connections and it peaked at 100,000 connections, so we probably had around 80,000 users connected to r/place at its peak. Websocket service bandwidth At the peak of r/place the websocket service was transmitting over 4 gbps (150 Mbps per instance and 24 instances). Frontend: Web and Mobile Clients Building the frontend for Place involved many of the challenges for cross-platform app development. We wanted Place to be a seamless experience on all of our major platforms including desktop web, mobile web, iOS and Android. The UI in place needed to do three important things: Display the state of the board in real timeFacilitate user interaction with the boardWork on all of our platforms, including our mobile apps The main focus of the UI was the canvas, and the Canvas API was a perfect fit for it. We used a single 1000 x 1000 <canvas> element, drawing each tile as a single pixel. Drawing the canvas The canvas needed to represent the state of the board in real time. We needed to draw the state of the entire board when the page loaded, and draw updates to the board state that came in over websockets. There are generally three ways to go about updating a canvas element using the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface: Drawing an existing image onto the canvas using drawImage()Draw shapes with the various shape drawing methods, e.g. using fillRect() to fill a rectangle with a colorConstruct an ImageData object and paint it into the canvas using putImageData() The first option wouldn’t work for us since since we didn’t already have the board in image form, leaving options 2 and 3. Updating individual tiles using fillRect() was very straightforward: when a websocket update comes in, just draw a 1 x 1 rectangle at the (x, y) position. This worked OK in general, but wasn’t great for drawing the initial state of the board. The putImageData() method was a much better fit for this, since we were able to define the color of each pixel in a single ImageData object and draw the whole canvas at once. Drawing the initial state of the board Using putImageData() requires defining the board state as a Uint8ClampedArray, where each value is an 8-bit unsigned integer clamped to 0-255. Each value represents a single color channel (red, green, blue, and alpha), and each pixel requires 4 items in the array. A 2 x 2 canvas would require a 16-byte array, with the first 4 bytes representing the top left pixel on the canvas, and the last 4 bytes representing the bottom right pixel. Illustration showing how canvas pixels relate to their Uint8ClampedArray representation On the backend, the board state is stored as a 4-bit bitfield. Each color is represented by a number between 0 and 15, allowing us to pack 2 pixels of color information into each byte. In order to use this on the client, we needed to do 3 things: Pull the binary data down to the client from our API“Unpack” the dataMap the 4-bit colors to useable 32-bit colors To pull down the binary data, we used the Fetch API in browsers that support it. For those that don’t, we fell back to a normal XMLHttpRequest with responseType set to “arraybuffer”. The binary data we receive from the API contains 2 pixels of color data in each byte. The smallest TypedArray constructors we have allow us to work with binary data in 1-byte units. This is inconvenient for use on the client so the first thing we do is to “unpack” that data so it’s easier to work with. This process is straightforward, we just iterate over the packed data and split out the high and low order bits, copying them into separate bytes of another array. Finally, the 4-bit color values needed to be mapped to useable 32-bit colors.API Response0x470xE9Unpacked0x040x070x0E0x09Mapped to 32bit colors0xFFA7D1FF0xA06A42FF0xCF6EE4FF0x94E044FF The ImageData structure needed to use the putImageData() method requires the end result to be readable as a Uint8ClampedArray with the color channel bytes in RGBA order. This meant we needed to do another round of “unpacking”, splitting each color into its component channel bytes and putting them into the correct index. Needing to do 4 writes per pixel was also inconvenient, but luckily there was another option. TypedArray objects are essentially array views into ArrayBuffer instances, which actually represent the binary data. One neat thing about them is that multiple TypedArray instances can read and write to the same underlying ArrayBuffer instance. Instead of writing 4 values into an 8-bit array, we could write a single value into a 32-bit array! Using a Uint32Array to write, we were able to easily update a tile’s color by updating a single array index. The only change required was that we had to store our color palette in reverse-byte order (ABGR) so that the bytes automatically fell in the correct position when read using the Uint8ClampedArray. 01230xFFD1A7FF0xFF426AA00xFFE46ECF0xFF44E0942551672092551601066625520711022825514822468255rgbargbargbargba Handling websocket updates Using the drawRect() method was working OK for drawing individual pixel updates as they came in, but it had one major drawbacks: large bursts of updates coming in at the same time could cripple browser performance. We knew that updates to the board state would be very frequent, so we needed to address this issue. Instead of redrawing the canvas immediately each time a websocket update came in, we wanted to be able to batch multiple websocket updates that come in around the same time and draw them all at once. We made two changes to do this: We stopped using drawRect() altogether, since we’d already figured out a nice convenient way of updating many pixels at once with putImageData()We moved the actual canvas drawing into a requestAnimationFrame loop By moving the drawing into an animation loop, we were able to write websocket updates to the ArrayBuffer immediately and defer the actual drawing. All websocket updates in between frames (about 16ms) were batched into a single draw. Because we used requestAnimationFrame, this also meant that if draws took too long (longer than 16ms), only the refresh rate of the canvas would be affected (rather than crippling the entire browser). Interacting with the Canvas Equally importantly, the canvas needed to facilitate user interaction. The core way that users can interact with the canvas is to place tiles on it. Precisely drawing individual pixels at 100% scale would be extremely painful and error prone, so we also needed to be able to zoom in (a lot!). We also needed to be able to pan around the canvas easily, since it was too large to fit on most screens (especially when zoomed in). Camera zoom Users were only allowed to draw tiles once every 5 minutes, so misplaced tiles would be especially painful. We had to zoom in on the canvas enough that each tile would be a fairly large target for drawing. This was especially important for touch devices. We used a 40x scale for this, giving each tile a 40 x 40 target area. To apply the zoom, we wrapped the <canvas> element in a <div> that we applied a CSS transform: scale(40, 40) to. This worked great for placing tiles, but wasn’t ideal for viewing the board (especially on small screens), so we made this toggleable between two zoom levels: 40x for drawing, 4x for viewing. Using CSS to scale up the canvas made it easy to keep the code that handled drawing the board separate from the code that handled scaling, but unfortunately this approach had some issues. When scaling up an image (or canvas), browsers default to algorithms that apply “smoothing” to the image. This works OK in some cases, but it completely ruins pixel art by turning it into a blurry mess. The good news it that there’s another CSS, image-rendering, which allows us to ask browsers to not do that. The bad news is that not all browsers fully support that property. Bad news blurs We needed another way to scale up the canvas for these browsers. I mentioned earlier on that there are generally three ways to go about drawing to a canvas. The first method, drawImage(), supports drawing an existing image or another canvas into a canvas. It also supports scaling that image up or down when drawing it, and though upscaling has the same blurring issue by default that upscaling in CSS has, this can be disabled in a more cross-browser compatible way by turning off the CanvasRenderingContext2D.imageSmoothingEnabled flag. So the fix for our blurry canvas problem was to add another step to the rendering process. We introduced another <canvas> element, this one sized and positioned to fit across the container element (i.e. the viewable area of the board). After redrawing the canvas, we use drawImage() to draw the visible portion of it into this new display canvas at the proper scale. Since this extra step adds a little overhead to the rendering process, we only did this for browsers that don’t support the CSS image-rendering property. Camera pan The canvas is a fairly big image, especially when zoomed in, so we needed to provide ways of navigating it. To adjust the position of the canvas on the screen, we took a similar approach to what we did with scaling: we wrapped the <canvas> element in another <div> that we applied CSS transform: translate(x, y) to. Using a separate div made it easy to control the order that these transforms were applied to the canvas, which was important for preventing the camera from moving when toggling the zoom level. We ended up supporting a variety of ways to adjust the camera position, including: Click and dragClick to moveKeyboard navigation Each of these methods required a slightly different approach. Click-and-drag The primary way of navigating was click-and-drag (or touch-and-drag). We stored the x, y position of the mousedown event. On each mousemove event, we found the offset of the mouse position relative to that start position, then added that offset to the existing saved canvas offset. The camera position was updated immediately so that this form of navigation felt really responsive. Click-to-move We also allowed clicking on a tile to center that tile on the screen. To accomplish this, we had to keep track of the distance moved between the mousedown and mouseup events, in order to distinguish “clicks” from “drags”. If the mouse did not move enough to be considered a “drag”, we adjusted the camera position by the difference between the mouse position and the point at the center of the screen. Unlike click-and-drag movement, the camera position was updated with an easing function applied. Instead of setting the new position immediately, we saved it as a “target” position. Inside the animation loop (the same one used to redraw the canvas), we moved the current camera position closer to the target using an easing function. This prevented the camera move from feeling too jarring. Keyboard navigation We also supported navigating with the keyboard, using either the WASD keys or the arrow keys. The four direction keys controlled an internal movement vector. This vector defaulted to (0, 0) when no movement keys were down, and each of the direction keys added or subtracted 1 from either the x or y component of the vector when pressed. For example, pressing the “right” and “up” keys would set the movement vector to (1, -1). This movement vector was then used inside the animation loop to move the camera. During the animation loop, a movement speed was calculated based on the current zoom level using the formula: movementSpeed = maxZoom / currentZoom * speedMultiplier This made keyboard navigation faster when zoomed out, which felt a lot more natural. The movement vector is then normalized and multiplied by the movement speed, then applied to the current camera position. We normalized the vector to make sure diagonal movement was the same speed as orthogonal movement, which also helped it feel more natural. Finally, we applied the same kind of easing function to changes to the movement vector itself. This smoothed out changes in movement direction and speed, making the camera feel much more fluid and juicy. Mobile app support There were a couple of additional challenges to embedding the canvas in the mobile apps for iOS and Android. First, we needed to authenticate the user so they could place tiles. Unlike on the web, where authentication is session based, with the mobile apps we use OAuth. This means that the app needs to provide the webview with an access token for the currently logged in user. The safest way to do this was to inject the oauth authorization headers by making a javascript call from the app to the webview (this would’ve also allowed us to set other headers if needed). It was then a matter of passing the authorization headers along with each api call. r.place.injectHeaders({‘Authorization’: ‘Bearer <access token>’}); For the iOS side we additionally implemented notification support when your next tile was ready to be placed on the canvas. Since tile placement occurred completely in the webview we needed to implement a callback to the native app. Fortunately with iOS 8 and higher this is possible with a simple javascript call: webkit.messageHandlers.tilePlacedHandler.postMessage(this.cooldown / 1000); The delegate method in the app then schedules a notification based on the cooldown timer that was passed in. What We Learned You’ll always miss something Since we had planned everything out perfectly, we knew when we launched, nothing could possibly go wrong. We had load tested the frontend, load tested the backend, there was simply no way we humans could have made any other mistakes. Right? The launch went smoothly. Over the course of the morning, as the popularity of r/place went up, so did the number of connections and traffic to our websockets instances: No big deal, and exactly what we expected. Strangely enough, we thought we were network-bound on those instances and figured we had a lot more headway. Looking at the CPU of the instances, however, painted a different picture: Those are 8-core instances, so it was clear they were reaching their limits. Why were these boxes suddenly behaving so differently? We chalked it up to place being a much different workload type than they’d seen before. After all, these were lots of very tiny messages; we typically send out larger messages like live thread updates and notifications. We also usually don’t have that many people all receiving the same message, so a lot of things were different. Still, no big deal, we figured we’d just scale it and call it a day. The on-call person doubled the number of instances and went to a doctor’s appointment, not a care in the world. Then, this happened: That graph may seem unassuming if it weren’t for the fact that it was for our production Rabbit MQ instance, which handles not only our websockets messages but basically everything that reddit.com relies on. And it wasn’t happy; it wasn’t happy at all. After a lot of investigating, hand-wringing, and instance upgrading, we narrowed down the problem to the management interface. It had always seemed kind of slow, and we realized that the rabbit diamond collector we use for getting our stats was querying it regularly. We believe that the additional exchanges created when launching new websockets instances, combined with the throughput of messages we were receiving on those exchanges, caused rabbit to buckle while trying to do bookkeeping to do queries for the admin interface. So we turned it off, and things got better. We don’t like being in the dark, so we whipped up an artisanal, hand-crafted monitoring script to get us through the project: $ cat s****y_diamond.sh #!/bin/bash /usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl list_queues | /usr/bin/awk '$2~/[0-9]/{print \"servers.foo.bar.rabbit.rabbitmq.queues.\" $1 \".messages \" $2 \" \" systime()}' | /bin/grep -v 'amq.gen' | /bin/nc 10.1.2.3 2013 If you’re wondering why we kept adjusting the timeouts on placing pixels, there you have it. We were trying to relieve pressure to keep the whole project running. This is also the reason why, during one period, some pixels were taking a long time to show up. So unfortunately, despite what messages like this would have you believe: The reasons for the adjustments were entirely technical. Although it was cool to watch r/place/new after making the change: So maybe that was part of the motivation. Bots Will Be Bots We ran into one more slight hiccup at the end of the project. In general, one of our recurring problems is clients with bad retry behavior. A lot of clients, when faced with an error, will simply retry. And retry. And retry. This means whenever there is a hiccup on the site, it can often turn into a retry storm from some clients who have not been programmed to back-off in the case of trouble. When we turned off place, the endpoints that a lot of bots were hitting started returning non-200s. Code like this wasn’t very nice. Thankfully, this was easy to block at the Fastly layer.

Reddit is home to many GIF loving communities – from r/HighQualityGifs and r/reactiongifs to r/chemicalreactiongifs and (for you action aficionados) r/MichaelBayGifs. Whether you pronounce them “GIFs” or “JIFs,” all of these moving image formats are welcome here on Reddit. Because of the love Reddit has for GIFs, we are excited to announce the launch of both GIPHY and Gfycat GIF bots for the Reddit community that you can start using today! Before GIF bots, redditors would have the cumbersome task of searching for the right GIF and copy and pasting a link into a comment. No more! Now all you need to do is type either /giphy or /gfycat with a [keyword] command when responding to a comment to call a GIF randomly chosen from GIPHY or Gfycat’s respective collections of top-shelf GIFs. The GIF bot works across Reddit desktop, iOS, iPad, and Android platforms. Remember, redditors will be able to see the auto-generated bot link to a GIF and the bot will echo back the original keyword command to confirm. And if you don’t get a response from the GIF bot, it’s possible the subreddit you’re commenting in doesn’t allow bots, or your comment is too complex for the bot to understand. We are excited to see the hilarity and creativity of what the Reddit community does with randomly generated GIFs. Cheers to GIPHY and Gfycat for supporting the Reddit community! Want to learn more?

Today we are excited to launch a completely revamped version of the Reddit self-serve advertising platform. Here are the major details: Complete Redesign We’ve redesigned the entire ads interface to be more user-friendly and easier on the eyes. Post-Pay Billing We no longer require you to pre-pay for ads and then go through a top-up process if you spend too much, or a refund process if you spend too little. We will now simply bill you for the ads you buy after we serve them. We have also added industry standard controls around daily budgets, campaign scheduling, and day-parting. Multiple Creatives Per-Campaign We now allow you to have more than one creative per campaign. You now create a campaign and add creatives to it rather than the other way around. Improved Reporting We now allow you to select arbitrary date ranges for reporting. We also now allow you to easily chart eCPM, eCPC, and CTR in addition to the spend, impression, and click metrics that were available previously. Here’s what it looks like: Add Targeting Add Creative Dashboard We’re very excited about this new system, which we’ve rebuilt from the ground up. This new infrastructure will give us significantly more flexibility, enabling us to add features quickly based on your feedback. Some features we look forward to adding in the near future include better targeting, new bid types, more granular reporting, and more. Check it out at: https://about.reddit.com/advertise Q & A Is the old Reddit ads system going away? You can continue using the old system for now but it will be discontinued in the next few months. We will send out a notification to the email address on your account once we have a more specific shutdown date. What will happen to my existing campaigns? Your existing campaigns will continue to run as is. However, the old Reddit ads system and the new Reddit ads system are separate. You won’t see campaigns that have been created in the old system in the new system and vice-versa. Can I reuse creatives that I made on the old Reddit ads system? Unfortunately not. Ads created on the new system must use creatives created on the new system. Creatives created on the new system can easily be shared between campaigns created on the new system.

To kick off the talk, each panelist gave a brief overview of the career path that led her to her current position. Caldwell started by sharing how she joined Microsoft as an intern and worked her way up to the role of senior engineering manager, contributing to the Office, Windows, and Xbox app store teams. “In my twelve years in the industry,” she said, “my career path was pretty atypical in that every two to two and a half years I switched teams … I was really motivated to understand the full Microsoft stack.” Now at Netflix, Caldwell works on the Open Connect team, which is responsible for one of the largest content-delivery networks in the world and an estimated 33% of peak traffic in North America. While Hang’s career got off to a similar start, going from a computer science degree at UCLA to an engineering position at IBM, she soon changed course, returning to school for an MBA and making the transition to product management work. “I took a slightly nontraditional path,” she explained. “I went into social gaming and joined a company called Zynga.” Like Caldwell, Hang climbed the ranks and soon found herself managing an entire game studio before eventually joining Hipmunk to define and build out scalable product management processes for the growing travel company. Finally, Slavens, who described her career as “tech adjacent,” detailed the vocational twists and turns that took her from a small-town theater program to her current position heading up the mastering and operations team at Pixar Animation Studios. “The beautiful thing about being in a very small community,” she explained, “is you didn’t get to be very choosy about what jobs you took. You couldn’t be very specialized and say, ‘Oh, well, I only do this.’ Nope. I was a set PA, I worked in wardrobe, I was Jamie Lee Curtis’s stand-in on a campy alien movie—which was essentially free film school.” The experience served Slavens well after she moved to Los Angeles and worked everywhere from a documentary programming company to Nickelodeon before joining Pixar, where she’s worked for the past eleven years. After the round of intros, Holloway dove into the questions, asking how the panelists maneuvered through setbacks in their careers, when they first found a job that felt like a good fit, and what guidance they’d received that helped them throughout their careers. Slavens took the opportunity to address all the hardworking taskmasters who may excel at their jobs, but struggle to accept their limitations. “One of the perils of appearing capable is that people will assume you don’t need support,” she said. “So you have to compel yourself to ask for the help you need.” Hang’s advice was directed at those still in the early days of their careers, who may feel unprepared stepping into their first management position. “I can’t remember who told me this,” Hang answered, “but it’s been my favorite quote for the past twelve years. ‘Success is never final and failure is never fatal.’ … So I encourage you to take those risks.” She continued, “You may not be ready day one, but I guarantee that if you have that mentality, you will grow into that role.” Closing the panel, Caldwell shared her hope for women who have already found success in their tech careers. “One of my mentors said, ‘It’s really important to give back,'” she said. “They understood the struggle that it took for me to go into computer science, to be the first in my family to go to college, go to Louisiana and then get hired at Microsoft—how big of a deal that was for my family. It’s really important that we instill these values in younger women who are actually trying to get their start in tech, so I would say my biggest advice … is to volunteer. You don’t know how much of a difference it can make in someone’s life.” Our thanks to Tia, Nancy, and Cynthia for stopping by to share their experiences with all of us at Reddit HQ."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/entertainment-weekly-debuts-latest-cover-in-exclusive-post-on-r-television","date":"2017-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Entertainment Weekly Debuts Latest Cover in Exclusive Post on r/television","text":"Earlier this morning, the writers of Entertainment Weekly took to r/television to share the cover (and some exclusive details) from their latest issue, dedicated to the much anticipated revival of Twin Peaks.

As the originator of the feature, he was, naturally, one of its first three alpha testers, along with League of Legends creators Riot Games and artist Shitty Watercolour—but for his new profile’s first post, Ohanian chose to ask redditors to share their stories. “I’ve been lucky enough to have met more redditors face-to-face than anyone,” he writes. “Over the last twelve years, I’ve crisscrossed the USA and traveled the world meeting redditors from Birmingham to Bangalore. The one thing they all have in common is why they love Reddit—because it’s either helped them feel heard, or showed them they weren’t alone.” After recalling personal encounters with redditors whose lives were impacted by a wide variety of communities, from r/cripplingalcoholism to r/aww, he invited users to share their own. “These stories help people realize what we on Reddit take for granted: that pseudonymous connections on Reddit can be just as important as the connections we make with people we see every day offline … So, in that spirit, I’d like to pose another question to all of you: How has the community at Reddit made your life better?” In response, redditors explained how Reddit—through the communities they belonged to, a chance thread they encountered, or other users they got to know over the years—had changed their lives. These are just a few of their stories: “wild theories” (u/the_ua):My introduction to reddit shifted the trajectory of my entire career. I was just starting out at university and beginning the medical course path I had chosen. My parents believed medicine was something that would shape me into the adult they envisioned. I found reddit in 2008 while participating in the Cloverfield ARG and talking to people over at Unfiction’s forums. I didn’t fully understand what “redditors” were, but I heard people say they were disrupting the process with their wild theories. I immediatly went there as I love wild theories. I fell in love with the hard work, incredible imagination, and a level comradery of in the community that I hadn’t seen online before. I became fascinated with technology and the online space as an extension of marketing. The idea of an immersive experience wrapped around a single event (ie. movie or product) was truly amazing (if done properly). I went back to school, switched to Marketing and Finance, and never looked back! It’s amazing that something that helped me positively refocus my life has also made it incredibly hard to focus in my life… “distraction, amusement, silly puns, and support” (u/MartijnCvB)I have cancer. I don’t say that because it solely defines who I am, or what I am, but because it drives my life; chemo therapy, surgeries, physical condition, unemployment, lack of finished further education. All of these things happened because I was diagnosed a week before my 22nd birthday, on June 1st 2012. A rare form of liver cancer that mostly children and young adults get. Since then I have been in and out of hospital. Since about then I have also been on Reddit. At first as a lurker without an account, but soon as an active user with one. Reddit was here for me when I was weak from 3 heavy surgeries, Reddit was here for me when my girlfriend (who I met in hospital) passed away, Reddit was here for me when I just got bad news or was feeling down. I don’t always post about it, but it gives me a sense of support or distraction from real life events. Just a few weeks ago, I was feeling down, and a news story about Amy Krause Rosenthal absolutely broke my heart. Not just for the situation but also for the common ground. The response I got to my story over in /r/books was heart warming and all the PMs and comments I got were the best. I’m now in the situation where I am 26, and I know I am unlikely to make it to 30 years old. It’s tough. But I do know that I will be using Reddit for as long as I can, for distraction, amusement, silly puns, and support, because I like Reddit a whole lot (For context, u/MartijnCvB’s comment in r/books is pasted below.) “solutions to very unique problems” (u/research_humanity)Reddit gave me community. I was isolated by abusive, cult-leading parents growing up. I’ve found people that went through the exact same thing. We trade horror stories and help each other fill in the gaps of missing knowledge. I work in a job where adult interaction happen less than 45 minutes out of a 10-12 hour day. Now, I can talk to people all over the USA who are doing the same thing, who help me trouble shoot and find solutions to very unique problems. I moved a couple years ago to a new city by myself. Thanks to the local subreddit, I figured out what things to do, places locals loved, etc. I’ve met up with a few redditors and have plans to meet a few more. I truly believe those friendships will last my whole life because they exist outside and above the drama that ruins so many other friendships. “the plethora of information” (u/RiftKingKass)r/askhistorians made me want to seriously study history with the plethora of information they have there, but also with the extremely qualified persons over there as well to answer any questions I have. Reddit has also allowed me to connect with others who have the same interests like I do, such as r/Kassadinmains . This website seriously changed my life from wanting to pursue a boring career path, to maybe becoming a history professor sometime down the road."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/introducing-a-new-user-profile-page-with-ushitty-watercolour","date":"2017-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Introducing a New User Profile Page With u/Shitty_Watercolour","text":"For the past five years, one of the most recognizable usernames on Reddit has been u/Shitty_Watercolour, the self-deprecating nom de paintset of 23-year-old British painter Hector Janse van Rensburg, who got his start in 2012 inking and watercolour-ing Reddit comments to the surprise and delight of OPs across the site. Since then, Shitty_Watercolour has developed a cult following for his sloths, epic sketch battles, posts on r/me_irl (and r/2meirl4meirl), and the distinct sense of humor and turmoil visible in all his illustrations. However, despite his longtime fame on the site and massive karma scores, following Shitty’s work on Reddit (which is, these days, far from shitty) has been difficult. That is, until today. With the rollout of Reddit’s new profile feature, content creators like Shitty will have a simpler, more visually appealing landing page, where they can set a banner and avatar and post directly to their very own profile. For the first time in Reddit history, users can follow a given content creator’s work, just like they’re subscribing to a subreddit. Shitty was a natural choice for one of the feature’s first testers. His work is embedded in Reddit’s history, from the art he made to welcome President Obama during his AMA to the painting he drew on the walls of Reddit HQ in 2015. (He’s even contributed to this blog!) Yet, despite his frequent appearances atop the front page and r/bestof and the fact that he’s been interviewed by a number of major outlets, Shitty’s approach to Reddit has always prioritized engaging with conversations on the site across a variety of communities. While he jokes that he now feels “liberated entirely from the shackles of subreddits,” he assures redditors that his approach to the site will remain largely unchanged. “The comment stuff? I’ll still be doing that.” As far as the first posts on his new profile are concerned, he plans to invite redditors to send him links to comments that they’d like to see drawn, something users already do by mentioning his username in scattered threads across the site. And for the new features of his profile, the banner and avatar, he offered this artistic explanation: “The banner is ‘The Creation of Adam.’ Or ‘Man.’ Is it Man or Adam? I think it’s Adam…” (He googles The Creation of Adam.) “Adam, yeah. But with a sloth, naturally. Even though I don’t really paint sloths anymore. It’s just a throwback. And it’s pretty terrible as well… My avatar is just me and my cat. Again, naturally.” You can check out Shitty’s new profile (and be one of his first followers) here.

But as eager as these gamers are to finally test out their new consoles, they’re also making time this Friday to pay it forward with a live stream raising money for charity. Ever since Nintendo announced the Switch, the surrounding community on Reddit has had a meteoric rise in popularity. In fact, before the console even had a name, Nintendo fans created r/NintendoNX as a forum to discuss what they anticipated from the upcoming console and any details they could find about the release, and as soon as the name was unveiled, there was a massive influx of users simultaneously trying to create r/NintendoSwitch. (Props to u/Andis1 for winning that honor.) After Nintendo debuted their commercial for the Switch, featuring the instantly viral character known only as “Nintendo Karen,” there was, of course, a subreddit for her, too: r/NintendoKaren. In just four months, the Switch community on Reddit has grown to over 116,000 subscribers. And in the final days leading up to the launch, the subreddit has been receiving over a million pageviews per day. To keep the momentum going, r/NintendoSwitch has held AMAs with Switch leaker Laura Kate Dale, the game devs of Yacht Club Games, and a few gamers lucky enough to get their hands on the Switch earlier than the rest of us. The community has also been remarkably well-organized (just take a look at the subreddit’s design on desktop)—with meet-ups, “daily question threads,” sticker design contests, and their very own mod-run website. Best of all, the community has decided to channel all the buzz and traffic generated by the launch of the Switch into a 24-hour live stream benefitting two charities: Child’s Play, an organization dedicated to “improv[ing] the lives of children in hospitals and domestic violence shelters through the generosity and kindness of the video game industry,” and Extra Life, which “unites thousands of players around the world in a 24 hour gaming marathon to support Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.” Over the past four months, the r/NintendoSwitch community has done such an amazing job of getting redditors into the Switchmas spirit that we decided to catch up with u/FlapSnapple, from the r/NintendoSwitch mod team, to chat about the community’s rise and what’s in store for the Switchmas live stream. u/FlapSnapple’s background as a gamer (and redditor) “The entire /r/NintendoSwitch moderation team are longtime Nintendo fans. For us, this is something we’ve been doing our whole lives, a labor of love. Personally, I got my start with /r/amiibo, a Reddit community for Nintendo’s recent figurine line. But many of our moderators have a similar story: we’ve helped build Nintendo communities for years, both on Reddit and elsewhere.” How u/FlapSnapple felt when the Switch was announced “We all loved the Wii U in our own ways, but it’s fair to say that it wasn’t Nintendo’s most successful console. So, when we heard rumors of something new, the excitement was impossible to contain. I speak for everyone on the team when I say that it’s a pleasure to help a new generation of fans discover the magic of Nintendo through the Switch.” The early days of r/NintendoSwitch “The /r/NintendoSwitch community began as /r/NintendoNX, with NX being the codename Nintendo was using for the Switch at the time. We were an active but small community, around 20,000 strong. “When the Switch launched, however, everything changed. We immediately brought on moderators from several prominent Reddit Nintendo subreddits and set to work building a lasting community, a place where Nintendo fans of all ages can gather to discuss news and events related to the Switch.” The biggest community highlights from the past four months “A growing community like ours can often feel like a rollercoaster, especially when the Switch is only just releasing in March. We’ve seen monumental, steady growth since the beginning, and each day is a new set of challenges. “There have been several big moments, but Nintendo’s initial teaser of the Switch in October and the official reveal presentation in January were easily the most important. Basically each time Nintendo drips out information, however, /r/NintendoSwitch lights up. And don’t get started on the waves of preorders for the system and popular games…” Bringing r/NintendoSwitch to Nintendo NY “Three members of our moderation team live in New York, so we always try to have a presence at events at Nintendo NY. Going to events is always a favorite for us, because it gives our team a chance to interact with people in our community one-on-one. And we’re only human: we’ve loved the opportunities to share our excitement over the Switch and try out the games, too!” Where r/NintendoSwitch fits into the Nintendo universe “With 115,000 subscribers and growing, /r/NintendoSwitch is one of the largest unofficial Nintendo Switch communities in the world. As part of that, we’re trying to build a positive relationship with game websites, journalists, and publishers so they can see us as a resource, a way to connect more directly with Nintendo Switch fans across the globe. “So far, we’ve posted AMA sessions with gaming journalists, publishers, retail employees, and more. We are absolutely going to push to do more of those in the coming months, because they’re incredibly popular. And we wouldn’t mind doing official events involving Nintendo. Nudge nudge, Nintendo. “As for critics, their opinions are important. We welcome any viewpoint on /r/NintendoSwitch as long as it’s well thought-out and in line with our community guidelines.” What u/FlapSnapple’s most excited about for Switchmas “On Friday, March 3, /r/NintendoSwitch is actually hosting a 24-hour Charity Livestream. The event coincides with the Switch release and benefit Child’s Play, which provides hospitals and therapy facilities with games and hardware, and Extra Life, which fundraises to allow hospitals to better care for sick children. “We’re going to feature gameplay videos, product reviews, and giveaways provided by official stream sponsors PDP, SanDisk, Nyko, and AverMedia. The goal is to raise at least $1,000 for each charity organization. “Of course we’re excited about getting our consoles, playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, meeting up with /r/NintendoSwitch subscribers in our cities, and planning more events and fun community activities, but giving back in this way is incredibly important to us.” What’s next for the subreddit after the Switch debuts “Building a community can be hard and messy, but it’s also rewarding. We only hope to be able to continue to see /r/NintendoSwitch grow and do our best to make sure it’s a fun place for people anywhere to come together and share their enjoyment of the Nintendo Switch.” Thanks to u/FlapSnapple and the r/NintendoSwitch mod team!

David Oyewolo—star of the MLK biopic Selma and more recently A United Kingdom, in which he plays Sir Seretse Khama—stopped by r/movies for his very first AMA. In r/IAmA, Dr. Clarence B. Jones—”former personal counsel, advisor, draft speech writer and close friend of Martin Luther King Jr.”—joined Soledad O’Brien for an AMA, discussing Dr. King’s legacy, reflecting on the current political climate in the U.S., and sharing this story, when asked by a redditor for his favorite memory of Dr. King: (You can read Dr. Jones and Soledad O’Brien’s full AMA here.) Other popular AMAs included 17-year-old CEO, animator, and author Maya Penn and NFL Network reporter Steve Wyche.

Maya Penn Dr. Clarence B. Jones Datwon Thomas Soledad O’Brien Fat Joe Kareem “Biggs” Burke Meanwhile, at the San Francisco office, Reddit’s People & Culture team hosted a series of talks, panels, and film discussions for the company’s internal Black History month celebrations. To kick off the month, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian moderated a live AMA with General Counsel Melissa Tidwell and VP of Engineering Nick Caldwell, answering questions from the rest of the company. The following week, Tidwell passed the mic to Reddit’s Account Coordinator Rohaina Hassan, who moderated another live AMA withLauren Mayfield and Jordan Bailey, the co-hosts of the podcast Black Girl Book Club, for which Hassan runs digital distribution. Other events included a discussion of 13th, Ava DuVernay’s award-winning film on mass incarceration and inequality in the criminal justice system, followed by a final in-office AMA—moderated by Reddit’s VP of People & Culture (and Stockton native) Katelin Holloway—with Michael Tubbs, the 26-year-old who became the first black Mayor of Stockton and the youngest person elected to that seat.

Fortunately, yesterday Reddit welcomed a number of these users to their new home online: a dedicated subreddit called r/IMDbFilmGeneral. In a post introducing IMDb users to their new home for discussion, Reddit Community Manager u/Sporkicide assured them, “you may find redditors to be a bit irreverent, and there are certainly some inside jokes, but have fun, and I guarantee that you’ll be playing along soon, smugly smiling at the newbies who don’t get the jokes.” You can read the full welcome message below: So far the new Reddit community is off to a promising start, with weekly watch threads, discussions on topics like underrated directors and smile-inducing movies. It’s clear that these new users are determined to rebuild their community on a new platform. In a post to the subreddit shortly after IMDb’s official disabling of their forums, founding user u/Fed_Rev offers a note of optimism for the opening of a new chapter for the community: I created FG Reddit as a spur of the moment reflex, literally within minutes of IMDb’s announcement. I had no grand plan, and I had no idea if it would actually pan out. I just felt like something had to be done, and before I knew it we were up and running here. Honestly, I was surprised when so many people immediately signed up and instantly started contributing. Within a couple days we had real momentum, and a tone had been set.

Their name is rLoop (short for “Reddit Loop”), and last month they took home the Pod Innovation Award in the competition’s finals at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. But First… The rLoop Origin Story rLoop’s origins can be traced back to a single comment in Reddit’s SpaceX community. On June 15, 2015, redditors in r/SpaceX were discussing an article about Elon Musk’s announcement of the competition when one user had an idea that struck a chord with others in the comments: A flurry of comments followed, culminating in the creation of a new community called “Reddit Loop,” where an initial group of 54 users signed up to help design a prototype for a pod capable of safely transporting a human passenger through a vacuum-sealed hyperloop tube. Unlike the predominantly university-based teams that had already begun work on their designs, however, rLoop started with some significant disadvantages: their team was unsponsored, they lacked organization, and their members were strangers from the internet from different countries, different time zones, different work schedules, and very different professional backgrounds. Needless to say, their first attempt at meeting as a collective was chaotic. But they got organized quickly, using their Reddit community (r/rLoop) to discuss how they could make their team more efficient. After gathering volunteers from r/SpaceX, r/engineering, and other Reddit communities, they picked team leaders by upvoting and downvoting nominees. Soon, they added Slack, Trello, Autodesk, and Google Hangouts to their workflow. Within a few short weeks, rLoop was a well-oiled machine, channeling the work of members from India, Canada, Poland, and a dozen other countries into a collaborative pod design upon which they made constant improvements. Led by Canadian Brent Lessard (the team’s project manager, a mechanical engineer with a background in smart roof technology) and Belgian-born Tom Lambot (the team’s lead engineer, with a background in rocket propulsion at NASA Ames), rLoop advanced their design by segmenting roles and allowing team members to come and go as they pleased. Lambot explains their novel organizational philosophy in terms any good Trekkie can understand. “I always talk about Star Trek’s the Borg,” he shared, in a visit to Reddit’s San Francisco office last year. “Everybody has a small part to play. The Borgs are very bad people—I want to say for the record—because they kill a lot of people. But I think it’s a very good analogy. Their goal was to assimilate the whole universe; our goal is to build a hyperloop. And we have a far lower body count.” Design Weekend In January 2016, after months of e-mailing, chatting, and video conferencing, the ever-changing, multi-national, Borg-like team converged at the Austin airport for SpaceX’s Design Competition. While many university teams had been working together in a campus environment, with corporate sponsors and easy access to teammates, rLoop had no sponsors at the time, and for most people on the team, Design Weekend was the first opportunity they had to meet face to face. Instead of a sponsor’s banner, they had a simple sign at their booth that read, “rLoop”—the lower-case “r” a nod to their Reddit origins, the “p” stylized to look like a tube with a pod traveling through it. The name seemed a fitting summary of the team’s presence at the competition: “hyperloop” without the “hype.” But while their booth looked humble, their design impressed the judges, proving that they weren’t just a group of internet underdogs. Their system of crowd-sourcing ideas and dividing their work into micro-tasks and making decisions democratically had resulted in a pod that could measure up to the university teams. rLoop won the award for Best Non-Student Design—and the chance to compete in the competition’s finals. Prep for the Finals After Design Weekend, the members of rLoop went back to their respective hometowns (whether in Canada, India, or Silicon Valley) feeling validated, as they were one of just 30 teams left in the competition. But while their design got high marks, the final stage of the competition required a physical prototype, which made their team geography—scattered across 14 countries—a disadvantage once more. To compensate, members in the Silicon Valley area secured a workspace in Menlo Park, where those who could take time off from work traveled to build the pod. As in earlier stages of the process, rLoop used a tech-savvy approach to keep the rest of the team involved with phase two of their pod design. We visited the build site ourselves in June and saw a Slack room projected against the wall, with a camera streaming live video of the build area to remote team members. rLoop’s engineers kindly explained how they monitored acceleration, jerk, vibrations, and temperatures within the pressure vessel; how they used redundancies in their levitation system; and how they used open-source software for their numerical simulation. (They also kindly forgave us for not understanding the vast majority of the science involved. But we encourage those who are interested in learning more to check out this video series highlighting rLoop’s build process.) The pod took approximately six months to build, with frequent revisions in response to SpaceX’s updates to the hyperloop test track. Finally, on the night of January 21, the team met up at the build site to take their finished pod to Hawthorne for the final round of the competition. rLoop, Meet Elon. Elon, rLoop. Driving by car from Menlo Park to Hawthorne offered the team a not-so-subtle reminder of the original purpose of Elon Musk’s hyperloop proposal: to speed up intercity transportation. “The trip took 13 hours,” Lessard recalls. “Incidentally, the same trip via Hyperloop would take ~25 minutes and wouldn’t be concerned with the weather.” Upon arriving in Los Angeles after the overnight drive, those who shepherded the pod joined forces with all the team members who had been working remotely. Many of them had never seen each other outside of video chat, and most team members who flew in for the competition had never seen the pod in person. “… we had over 60 members from 17 countries arrive in LA, meet face to face for the first time in our 19 month history, and see the hardware for the first time,” Lessard explains. That Friday, rLoop presented their pod to the judges, who inspected and rated the design. While SpaceX’s partial vacuum track only permitted three of the teams to send their pods through the tube, the team still got ample opportunities to show off their pod. On Sunday, the competition was opened to the general public, so rLoop—as the only team that formed on Reddit—had to introduce their design in a fittingly Reddit-y way. “We rolled the rPod down the street playing ‘Never Gonna Give You Up,’” Lessard says, noting that after the event, SpaceX’s social media team joined in on the joke by putting a video of rLoop’s musical debut on the official SpaceX website. While rLoop missed the opportunity to test their pod in the test track, the real moment of truth came that afternoon, when two special guests stopped by to see their pod: SpaceX’s Hyperloop Director, Steve Davis, and Founder and CEO, Elon Musk. Davis introduced rLoop to Musk by saying, “This is the team from Reddit” “We had a brief few minutes to describe the pod and how the team came together,” Lessard explains, but rLoop’s unique design and story piqued his interest. “Elon was impressed with both the pod and how the team organized, and invited us back for Competition 2 in the summer … We certainly would have liked to see our pod run full speed in a partial vacuum in the tube that weekend, but we are committed now more than ever to continue our work and see the rPod fly in Competition 2.” After meeting Musk, the team received further praise for their design from the judges, winning the award for Pod Innovation. “The awards were a bit surreal,” Lessard says. “The team really deserved it. 19 months of work, with no existing organization or infrastructure when we started. We were that rag-tag team of underdogs working tirelessly for the chance to have a real impact. Fantastic to be recognized, super appreciative for the opportunity from SpaceX to compete, and extremely thankful to the community who supported us.” After the awards ceremony, the team paused to commemorate the moment with a group photo, something they had little time for in the lead-up to the competition. When asked what’s next for the team, here’s what the two leaders of rLoop had to say. Brent Lessard:Immediately – sleep and family time. My daughter was born 2 months before we started rLoop, and my wife has been incredibly supportive throughout the journey. I think everyone`s immediate family and friends deserve thanks for their support as well, I know what it was like to be around me throughout the past 19 months! Once we debrief from Competition 1 weekend we’re going to refocus on our Hyperloop prototype pod, implement the full functionality we had designed, and test and demonstrate our scalable Hyperloop solution. We also have created a lot of value in terms of the organization and processes we’ve developed to facilitate global collaboration, we would like to see the rLoop model applied to other large-scale ‘moonshot’ projects. (Asteroid mining here we come!) Tom Lambot:That’s the $1M question. Priority is getting some rest and get back with friends and family who have been borderline neglected in the last year! After that, who knows. We know a lot about the hyperloop. We have a prototype that uses componants that can be scaled up. At the same time we have an amazing system to tackle moonshot projects. I really believe in crowdsourced engineering and citizen science/space. Collecting all the smartest mind of the world through one platform to bring humanity to the next level sounds like a fun summer project 😉 You can follow rLoop as they continue their work through their community on Reddit, r/rLoop, and on their website."},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/announcing-reddits-new-partnership-with-crowdtangle","date":"2017-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Partnerships"],"title":"Announcing Reddit’s New Partnership With CrowdTangle","text":"This week, Reddit unveiled a new partnership with CrowdTangle, the publishing tool that’s made a name for itself in social media-savvy newsrooms for optimizing content discovery and social monitoring across platforms. The partnership, announced Tuesday on CrowdTangle’s company blog, will help journalists stay on top of what’s trending before it hits the front page and enable publishers to measure how they’re performing on Reddit. Media outlets and individual reporters can use the tool to track which subreddits are sharing and discussing their content and surface stories from almost 10,000 of Reddit’s most active communities, organized by vertical, specific topic, region, and other categories. The platform also makes it simple for writers to embed posts and comments, ensuring that redditors and their communities get the credit they deserve. “Reddit is the source behind countless stories that shape the news every day,” Reddit’s Director of Business Development Alex Riccomini shared on CrowdTangle’s blog. “In the past, writers who looked to Reddit for content had to take screenshots of comments, and they often struggled to surface stories efficiently for their beats. With our embed tool, we brought the days of screenshots to an end. With CrowdTangle, we’re excited to give journalists a new way to find relevant threads from thousands of communities on Reddit — quickly and painlessly.” The partnership marks the latest step by Reddit’s Business Development team to strengthen ties between publishers and the Reddit community.

My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I’ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here.

After news of the executive order broke, discussions of the immigration restriction and protests that followed reached the top of many of Reddit’s largest communities, including r/news, r/worldnews, r/pics, and r/politics. Over the course of the weekend, we saw responses to the news at the top of communities with no ties to politics, like r/movies, r/nba, and r/soccer; local communities like r/Michigan, r/SeattleWA, and r/boston; international subreddits like r/canada and r/australia; and even r/HumansBeingBros.

Four months ago, a new Reddit community called r/wholesomememes was born. Since then, over 275,00 325,000 people have joined, making it one of the fastest-growing new communities on the site (and one of today's trending subreddits). \"When we first created the sub,\" founding redditor u/Poppwall writes, \"we used 'Internet for the Spirit' as the title, and I think it’s still very fitting.\" On September 17, 2016, the self-described \"freshly 20-year-old college student from Pennsylvania\" formed r/wholesomememes, submitting this photo as the inaugural post: Given the community's explosive popularity since then, it may come as a surprise that its founder had never started a subreddit before. Prior to r/wholesomememes, u/Poppwall primarily used Reddit to follow sports. \"I’ve had my account for 5 years, I think, but I’ve only heavily used it for the past year or so, mostly to keep up on basketball,\" he explains. \"Shout out r/NBA and r/sixers #trusttheprocess.\" After seeing scattered examples of wholesome memes on other sites, however, he decided to create a home for them on Reddit \"to encourage the creation of more wholesome memes and to offer a dependable place for people to come and find and celebrate new wholesome content.\" If you're not familiar with \"wholesome memes,\" the mod team offers this helpful definition of the term: whole·some meme \\ˈhōl-səm\\ \\mēm\\ (n.): a meme that promotes health or well-being of body, mind, and/or soul a meme that is pure of heart, devoid of corruption or malice, modest, stable, virtuous, and all-around sweet and compassionate a meme that conveys support, positivity, compassion, understanding, love, affection, and genuine friendship by re-contextualizing classic meme formats, and using them to display warmth and empathy a meme with no snark or sarcasm that displays genuine human emotion and subverts a generally negative meme to be more positive To get a feel for what sorts of memes promote the well-being of your body, mind, and soul, here are a few popular examples: \"Our community,\" he summarizes, \"is a place where people can come to enjoy unabashed kindness in a familiar format.\" According to u/Poppwall, subscribers fall into one main demographic: \"People who want to celebrate the good in their lives. Hopefully that’s everybody, but we have the ones that like memes.\" Like many new subreddits, r/wholesomememes relied primarily on posts from the community's founding members to keep it populated with new content in its early days. \"[Co-founder] u/ilegalimigrants and I spent our time editing popular memes in MS Paint to make them wholesome and asking other subs for advice,\" he shares. \"Eventually more members joined our community and then u/VileVial accepted my invite to join the moderating team and bailed us out in CSS, moderation legwork, and our ground rules. After he did that work, we really gained traction. I can’t thank him enough.\" Even with other redditors pitching in to help establish the new sub, many users who stumbled upon it didn't know what to make of it. \"Initially, people were unsure whether we were adding another layer of irony to the memes we were coopting or if we were genuinely as wholesome as we said, and that debate was vital in attracting people to our community,\" u/Poppwall explains. https://www.reddit.com/r/whole... \"I remember how much reaching 100 subscribers shocked me—I think u/ilegalimigrants and I set our expectations at around a dozen subscribers.\" At the one-month mark, r/wholesomememes reached 4,368 subscribers. The next month, it hit 57,102. And after three months, the subscriber count totaled 169,640, making it the largest generator of wholesome memes on the internet. The community's growth is mirrored in posts from r/MemeEconomy, where users first wondered if wholesome memes could \"become a thing,\" then predicted a surge in popularity, noted their versatility, and eventually decided they were a \"rock-solid investment.\" The community spawned a number of offshoot subreddits like r/wholesomegifs and r/wholesomecomics, collectively dubbed \"The Wholesome Network,\" and became the subject of several posts on r/OutOfTheLoop, an unofficial badge of true fame on Reddit. \"Also being featured in Cosmopolitan was rad,\" u/Poppwall adds. \"Shout out Cosmo.\" While u/Poppwall jokes that the subreddit is a \"scheme to recruit a quarter of a million kind internet strangers to mass produce compliments I can use in real life,\" the consistent, month-over-month growth of the community has been a recurring source of curiosity on Reddit. One explanation points to the negativity and cynicism surrounding the end of 2016—with a constant stream of news around the U.S. presidential election and seemingly never-ending series of beloved celebrities who passed away—but u/Poppwall believes the real answer is much broader: I’ve seen a lot of people theorize that it’s a reactionary thing—that 2016 has really worn on people and that they need a respite. Personally, I believe that our community isn’t a reaction but instead represents something basic that hasn’t really been as accessible online. There’s a stereotype of going online to argue with people but we wouldn’t have the internet if we didn’t primarily want to share with each other. People browse Reddit, Twitter, etc. because they want to learn about and share with others, and the memes we see are great because they’re inside jokes that we can laugh at with people across the world. Lately, memes have been depressing and self-deprecating and I think lots of people have tried to change their understanding of themselves so that they can relate, but internally everybody wants to be happy and love themselves. Our community has grown quickly because our memes represent that ubiquitous human quality and internally we recognize the power that the internet has on our self-image and our memes enable people to feel good about themselves. This sense of positivity now permeates the community, from their attitude towards each other's posts... ... to their thoughts on the New Year. Recently, some redditors in r/wholesomememes have taken to posting screenshots of comments from other subreddits to highlight moments of \"wholesomeness\" outside of their community: And at the end of last year, moderator u/Noerdy initiated a new tradition for the community: \"Find a Friend\" threads, in which users are invited to post comments with a few of their interests for the express purpose of \"encourag[ing] conversation starting and social interaction online.\" The first thread received over 2,500 comments. When asked what he hopes to see from r/wholesomememes in 2017, u/Poppwall offers a candid response. \"I’m not sure truthfully. The past three months have been unreal. Default sub or bust, I guess.\" In the meantime, he welcomes anyone who hasn't visited the community to check it out and, hopefully, join in the wholesomeness. \"Stop by!

For the past six months we have been examining and reviewing reddit’s community policies and practices, collecting and analyzing data, defining our own goals, and making some hard decisions. Last week, we announced our internal company values, and we were proud to say: We value privacy, freedom of expression, open discussion, and humanity, and we want to make sure that we uphold these principles for all kinds of people. We didn’t announce them because we’d accomplished them, rather because we are striving for them. We’ve already begun making changes to live up to these values. In January, we released our firstannual transparency report to share when we provide private information to law enforcement and when we take down content in response to legal demands or for privacy reasons. In March, we updated our privacy policy to address revenge porn, regardless of celebrity status. Yesterday, we made additional changes to be even more transparent about content that reddit removes for legal reasons. Today, we’re making another change that we believe will help make reddit a better place for everyone. We have been looking closely at the conversations on reddit and at personal safety.

We’ve seen new types of conversations as AMAs and /r/askscience and /r/askhistoriansdeveloped. We’ve seen more and more organic content as part of conversations after the introduction of self-posts. We’ve also seen the scope and scale of discussions explode. Unfortunately, not all the changes on reddit have been positive. We’ve seen many conversations devolve into attacks against individuals. We share redditors’ frustration with these interactions. We are also seeing more harassment and different types of harassment as people’s use of the Internet and the information available on the Internet evolve over time. For example, some users are harassing people across platforms and posting links on reddit to private information on other sites. Instead of promoting free expression of ideas, we are seeing our open policies stifling free expression; people avoid participating for fear of their personal and family safety. Last month, we conducted asurvey of over 15,000 redditors—these are people who are part of the reddit community—that showed negative responses to comments have made people uncomfortable contributing or even recommending reddit to others. The number one reason redditors do not recommend the site—even though they use it themselves—is because they want to avoid exposing friends to hate and offensive content. One of our basic rules is “Keep everyone safe”. Being safe from threat enables people to express very personal views and experiences—and to help inform and change other people’s views: Because of this, we are changing our practices to prohibit attacks and harassment of individuals through reddit with the goal of preventing them. We define harassment as: Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them. If you are being harassed, report the private message, post or comment and user by emailing contact@reddit.com or modmailing us; include external links if they are relevant. This change will have no immediately noticeable impact on more than 99.99% of our users. It is specifically designed to prevent attacks against people, not ideas. It is our challenge to balance free expression of ideas with privacy and safety as we seek to maintain and improve the quality and range of discourse on reddit. We are committed to evolving with our communities and the Internet to keep reddit a place where every day more voices are participating in free expression of all ideas. We also value your feedback as members of the community and welcome suggestions in the comments on how we can do this even better. – Jessica (/u/5days), Ellen (/u/ekjp), Alexis (/u/kn0thing) & the rest of team reddit"},{"platform":"Reddit","url":"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-we-need-to-talk","date":"2011-04-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"reddit, we need to talk…","text":"…about the posting of users’ personal information on this site. There has been an unacceptable surge of this happening lately. We’ve had this discussion before, just three months ago. But alas, that is an eternity in internet time. Also, we understand that our userbase is growing exponentially, so it’s time to reiterate: DO NOT POST USERS’ PERSONAL INFORMATION. EVER. NO phone numbers, NO email addresses, NO real names, NO blood types, NO SSN’s, NO facebook pics or profiles, NO mothers’ maiden names, NOTHING. This is a ban-on-sight offense, and lately we have banned multiple users for posting personal info. We’re not going to condone this kind of behavior. If you feel the urge to arm yourself with torches and pitchforks and personal information … step away from the computer, take a deep breath, and remember: This is the Internet. You don’t know these people. If you heard that some guy down the street was trying to scam someone on YouTube or lied about the time they made mayonnaise in their bathtub or pretended to be a time traveler from the future, would you go over there and egg their house and throw bricks through their window and kidnap their puppy? Seriously? Posting personal information is the Internet version of vandalism and abuse and will not be tolerated. If you see it, report it and message the admins, aka the moderators of /r/reddit.com. tl;dr Nope, you’ll have to read the post. discuss this post on reddit"}]
