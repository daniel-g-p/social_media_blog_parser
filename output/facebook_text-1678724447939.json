Having a personal intimate image shared with others can be scary and overwhelming, especially for young people. It can feel even worse when someone tries to use those images as a threat for additional images, sexual contact or money — a crime known as sextortion. Take It Down lets young people take back control of their intimate images. People can go to TakeItDown.NCMEC.org and follow the instructions to submit a case that will proactively search for their intimate images on participating apps. Take It Down assigns a unique hash value — a numerical code — to their image or video privately and directly from their own device. Once they submit the hash to NCMEC, companies like ours can use those hashes to find any copies of the image, take them down and prevent the content from being posted on our apps in the future. Built in a way that respects young peoples’ privacy and data security, Take It Down allows people to only submit a hash — rather than the intimate image or video itself — to NCMEC. Hashing turns images or videos into a coded form that can no longer be viewed, producing hashes that are secure digital fingerprints. With the launch of Take It Down, people of all ages can stop the spread of their intimate images online, including: Young people under 18 years old worried their content has been or will be posted online Parents or trusted adults on behalf of a young person Adults who are worried about images taken of them when they were under 18. Take It Down was designed with Meta’s financial support. We are working with NCMEC to promote Take It Down across our platforms, in addition to integrating it into Facebook and Instagram so people can easily access it when reporting potentially violating content. Take It Down builds off of the success of platforms like StopNCII, a platform we launched in 2021 with South West Grid for Learning (SWGfL) and more than 70 NGO’s worldwide, which helps adults stop the spread of their intimate images online, a practice commonly referred to as “revenge porn.” Meta doesn’t allow content or behavior that exploits young people, including the posting of intimate images or sextortion activities. We work to prevent this content as well as inappropriate interactions between young people and suspicious accounts attempting to take advantage of them. For example, we default teens into the most private settings on Facebook and Instagram, we work to restrict suspicious adults from connecting with teens on those apps, and we educate teens about the dangers of engaging with adults they do not know online. We’ve also made it easier for people to report potentially harmful content, particularly if it involves a child. On Instagram, we recently introduced new features to make it even more difficult for suspicious adults to interact with teens. Now, these adults will no longer be able to see teen accounts when scrolling through the list of people who have liked a post or when looking at an account’s Followers or Following list. If a suspicious adult follows a teen account, we will send that teen a notification prompting them to review and remove the new follower. We are also prompting teens to review and restrict their privacy settings. When someone comments on a teen’s post, tags/mentions them in another post, or includes their content in Reels Remixes or Guides, the teen will receive a notification to review their privacy settings, and will have the option to stop people from interacting with them. We’ve developed more than 30 tools to support the safety of teens and families across our apps, including supervision tools for parents and age-verification technology that helps teens have age-appropriate experiences online. We also provide resources for teens that inform them of the potential harms of taking intimate images, and the other ways they can find help if they want to stop the spread of that content. There are more resources for parents so they can talk to their teens about how to be safe online in our Safety Center and Family Center."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/metas-integrity-and-transparency-reports-q4-2022/","date":"2023-02-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Integrity and Transparency Reports, Fourth Quarter 2022","text":"Today, we’re publishing our quarterly reports for the fourth quarter of 2022 including the Community Standards Enforcement Report, the Widely Viewed Content Report, Oversight Board Quarterly Update and the Adversarial Threat Report. All reports are available in the Transparency Center. Our report highlights include: The Adversarial Threat Report Over the past five years, we’ve shared our findings about threats we detect and remove from our platforms. In today’s threat report, we’re sharing information about three networks we took down for violating our policies against coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) and mass reporting (or coordinated abusive reporting) during the last quarter to make it easier for people to see the progress we’re making in one place. We’re also providing an update on our work against influence operations — both covert and overt — in a year since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We have shared information about our findings with industry partners, researchers and policymakers. The Community Standards Enforcement Report In the fourth quarter, we continue to make progress on removing content that violates our Community Standards with prevalence remaining relatively consistent across a wide range of violation areas. Separately, we’ve updated our cross-problem AI system, combining several models so that we’re consolidating learnings across hate speech, bullying and harassment and violence and incitement. This and other continued improvements or adjustments to proactive detection technology, in many instances, lead to improved accuracy. We also consistently refine our methodology for this report in an effort to improve the metrics we provide. This quarter we’ve updated how we calculate proactive rate. As a result of these improvements, we’re seeing several shifts in the proactive rates across different areas. This methodology update only changes how we measure the proactive rate metric, but not our approach to proactively identifying violating content. The Widely Viewed Content Report This quarter’s report includes one case of engagement bait and one piece of content removed because it was posted by a Page that was taken down for repeatedly violating our Community Standards. We rigorously work to understand the content ecosystem and evaluate how effective our policies and integrity measures are so we can close the gaps we find along the way. The Oversight Board Quarterly Update The Oversight Board is a valuable source of external perspective and accountability for Meta that people can appeal to if they disagree with content enforcement decisions on Facebook and Instagram. We’re committed to implementing all of the Board’s content decisions and responding to all of their recommendations publicly, having already committed to implement — or explore the feasibility of implementing — 78% of their recommendations to date. Q4 marked two years since the Oversight Board’s first decision and we closed the quarter with building a framework to expand the Board’s scope and impact. This collaboration with the Board resulted in finalizing a series of updates that will streamline the Board’s operations and allow them to more efficiently select, deliberate and make decisions on tough issues. Over the past two years the Oversight Board has given us valuable feedback on our policies and processes which has led to real changes. For example, we recently completed a global rollout of more informative user messaging to let people know whether human or automated review was responsible for the removal of their content. Also prompted by feedback from the Oversight Board, we are sharing more details about steps we’re taking to update Facebook’s penalty system. We continue to invest in refining our policies and improving our enforcement, and as part of that work, we are updating our penalty system to make it more fair and effective. Under the new system, we will focus on helping people understand why we have removed their content, which is shown to be more effective at preventing re-offending, rather than so quickly restricting their ability to post. We are still removing violating content just as we did before, but now we’re also giving people the chance to change their behavior while still applying stronger penalties to more severe violations: posting content that includes terrorism, child exploitation, human trafficking, serious suicide promotion, sexual exploitation, the sale of non-medical drugs, or the promotion of dangerous individuals and organizations. This leads to faster and more impactful actions for those that continuously violate our policies. These changes follow feedback from our community — including our civil rights auditors, the Oversight Board and independent experts — who noted that our current systems needed better balance between punishing and encouraging remediation through education. Other updates We revamped our Pages, Groups and Events policies to streamline, clarify and ensure the policies remain relevant and accurate. We updated the notifications people see on Facebook when they try to view content that has been restricted due to local laws. In most cases, the notification will now include information letting them know which government authority sent the take down request resulting in the restriction. These changes are an important part of our commitment under our Corporate Human Rights Policy and as a member of the Global Network Initiative. More details about our approach to content restrictions can be found in the Transparency Center. Our Ongoing Commitment Our commitment to integrity is ongoing, and we will continue to update, improve and evolve our policy enforcement in an ever-changing environment. We are focused on preserving people’s ability to connect with each other around the world, particularly during times of crisis. We also want to ensure businesses that rely on our apps to reach customers have access to the support they need. From global brands to the local coffee shop, we know that businesses can be targets for adversarial activity which can disrupt their operations. So we will continue to focus heavily on improving overall support for business users."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/meta-is-improving-facebooks-penalty-system/","date":"2023-02-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"How We’re Improving Facebook’s Penalty System","text":"Today, as prompted by feedback from the Oversight Board’s continued push to ensure our penalty system is more proportionate, we’re taking steps to update Facebook’s penalty system to make it more effective and fair. Since nothing is changing about the underlying content removal, we do not anticipate this penalty system refinement to have a material effect on prevalence. With this update we will still be able to keep our app safe while also allowing people to express themselves. Under the new system, we will focus on helping people understand why we have removed their content, which is shown to be more effective at preventing re-offending, rather than so quickly restricting their ability to post. We will still apply account restrictions to persistent violators, typically beginning at the seventh violation, after we’ve given sufficient warnings and explanations to help the person understand why we removed their content. We will also restrict people from posting in groups at lower thresholds where warranted. For more serious violations: posting content that includes terrorism, child exploitation, human trafficking, suicide promotion, sexual exploitation, the sale of non-medical drugs or the promotion of dangerous individuals and organizations, we will continue to apply immediate consequences, including account removal in severe cases. The vast majority of people on our apps are well-intentioned. Historically, some of those people have ended up in “Facebook jail” without understanding what they did wrong or whether they were impacted by a content enforcement mistake. Our analysis has found that nearly 80% of users with a low number of strikes do not go on to violate our policies again in the next 60 days. This means that most people respond well to a warning and explanation since they don’t want to violate our policies. But at the same time, some people are determined to post violating content regardless of our policies. Our analysis suggests that applying more severe penalties at the seventh strike is a more effective way to give well-intentioned people the guidance they need while still removing bad actors. As well as being more effective, these changes will be fairer to those people who may have been disproportionately impacted by our old system, particularly when we made an incorrect moderation decision or missed context. For example, someone may jokingly post, “I’m on my way to kidnap you,” not knowing that this statement could violate our violence and incitement policy, when really it was a post about taking a friend out for dinner after that person had a rough day. Someone else might post a friend’s name and address as a way of sharing information for a party, and without that context, that post might appear to be sharing personally identifiable information in violation of our policies. The implications of overenforcement are real — when people are unintentionally caught up in this system, they may find it hard to run their business, connect with their communities or express themselves. Our previous system resorted quickly to long penalties, such as a 30-day block on a person’s ability to create content. These long blocks were frustrating for well-intentioned people who had made mistakes, and they did little to help those people understand our policies. The blocks also made it harder for us to spot violation trends and sometimes had the effect of letting bad actors stay on the site longer. Our new system, which reduces the number of restriction periods, will allow us to detect persistent violators in less time, leading to faster and more impactful actions. Today’s changes, while based on our own analysis and feedback of the Oversight Board, are also responsive to feedback from our community — including our civil rights auditors — who noted that our current enforcement system needs more focus on proportionality. Independent experts who offered their guidance on this topic have routinely noted that our penalty system should have a better balance between punishing and encouraging remediation through education. “…It is positive that Meta has introduced further transparency and coherence in this area as a result of implementing prior Oversight Board recommendations, moving towards what should be a more proportionate and transparent approach with higher strike-to-penalty thresholds. Meta’s plans to issue more comprehensive penalty notifications should ensure that users are better placed to understand the reasons for the consequences of strikes and the reasons for feature-limits in the future.” – Oversight Board Iran protest slogan Case Decision External guidance is an important part of this process, and we’ll continue to work with experts in academia, civil society and the policy community to continue to improve and evolve our policy enforcement in an ever changing environment. We will provide more updates as this process continues."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/increasing-our-ads-transparency/","date":"2023-02-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Meta"],"title":"Increasing Our Ads Transparency","text":"Today, we are launching the next iteration of the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool, which we created nearly a decade ago to give people information about why they see certain ads across our technologies. Since its initial launch, we’ve made improvements to “Why am I seeing this ad?” to make it easier to use and understand. Today’s update takes it one step further and now includes information about how we use machine learning models to show people ads. What’s New Beginning today, the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool on Facebook will include: Information summarized into topics about how your activity both on and off our technologies — such as liking a post on a friend’s Facebook page or interacting with your favorite sports website — may inform the machine learning models we use to shape and deliver the ads you see. New examples and illustrations explaining how our machine learning models connect various topics to show you relevant ads. More ways to find our ads controls. You will now be able to access Ads Preferences from additional pages in the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool. Why We Built This We worked closely with external privacy experts and policy stakeholders from around the world to get input on what transparency changes they want to see in our ads system. A consistent answer was that we should increase our transparency around how our machine learning models contribute to the ads people see on our services. We are committed to using machine learning models responsibly. Being transparent about how we use machine learning is essential because it ensures that people are aware that this technology is a part of our ads system and that they know the types of information it is using. By stepping up our transparency around how our machine learning models work to deliver ads, we aim to help people feel more secure and increase our accountability. The changes we’re making to “Why am I seeing this ad?” reflect the feedback we’ve received and are designed to provide people with clear information about the machine learning models that help determine the ads they see. These new features are the latest step in our continuous evolution of “Why am I seeing this ad?” We will continue to improve our ads transparency offerings and search for new ways to provide people with better understanding of how we use data and technology to show them ads. Where Can I Find “Why am I seeing this ad?” You can click on the three-dot menu in the upper-right-hand corner of any ad you see in your Facebook Feed and navigate to “Why am I seeing this ad.” If an explanation in the tool is unclear or confusing, we want to hear about it. You can use the feedback tool at the bottom of “Why am I seeing this ad?” to tell us about your experience and how we can do better. As always, you can still hide all ads from a given advertiser and access your ads preferences from the “Why am I seeing this ad?” interface. This updated version of “Why am I seeing this ad?” is rolling out globally on Facebook first, and we plan on expanding it to Instagram in the future."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/helping-creators-and-publishers-manage-intellectual-property/","date":"2023-01-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta"],"title":"Helping Creators and Publishers Manage Intellectual Property with Rights Manager","text":"Today, we’re launching a website dedicated solely to helping educate people on the way Rights Manager combats copyright infringement and protects lawful expression on Facebook and Instagram.

From ongoing improvements to our privacy program to strides being made in end-to-end encryption, here’s a look at what we’ve been up to and where we’re going. Showing Our Work Today, we’re publishing the third iteration of our Privacy Progress Update, which we publish each year to demonstrate technical and operational improvements we’ve made. This latest version includes details on privacy governance, consumer-facing privacy controls and innovative privacy solutions like privacy aware infrastructure. We remain as committed as ever to putting people’s privacy first in everything we do. Building Educational Tools We launched Privacy Center alongside our easier to understand Privacy Policy last year to give people a place where they could learn more about our approach to privacy across our apps and technologies. Privacy Center is now fully available on Facebook. We’ve also added two new modules to Privacy Center — one focused on safety, where people can learn more about how they can protect themselves and their information; and one focused on privacy for teens, where people can learn about the special protections we offer for young people. Giving People Control We want people to understand their options when it comes to privacy on our apps. That’s why we’re notifying people on Facebook to take a Privacy Checkup to review some of their important privacy settings. Whether you’re tweaking your audience settings or setting up two-factor authentication, it’s always worth examining your settings on a regular basis, and people can also now set a recurring reminder for Privacy Checkup to be automatically notified to use the control. Protecting Teen Privacy In November, we introduced updates on Facebook and Instagram that further protect teens online. Now, everyone who is under the age of 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into more private settings when they join Facebook. Earlier this year, we announced that we’re further restricting the options advertisers have to reach teens, as well as the information we use to show ads to teens. Age and location will be the only information about a teen that we’ll use to show them ads. We’ve also added a new privacy page with more information for teens about the tools and privacy settings they can use across our technologies. Advancing Private Messaging We’ve introduced a number of new privacy features on WhatsApp to give you even more control. You can now leave group messages without notifying everyone, choose who can see when you’re online and prevent screenshots on View Once messages. And on Messenger, we’re announcing new product features for your end-to-end encrypted chats, as well as increased testing for default end-to-end encryption. Prioritizing Privacy as We Help Build the Metaverse The metaverse presents an opportunity for us to build privacy into a new technology from the ground up and we’ve been working with experts in academia, civil rights groups and industry organizations to help ensure we’re innovating in this new space responsibly. We are committed to baking in strong privacy protections from the start, and developing transparent tools to let people be in control of their experience. This guided our development of features like eye-tracking and Natural Facial Expressions in our Meta Quest Pro virtual reality headset. We took a similar approach with our Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, which feature an LED light to let people know when photos or videos are being captured and a power switch to toggle the glasses on and off. Visit our privacy microsite for more information on these features and tips on how people can use the glasses safely and responsibly. We look forward to sharing more updates on how we’re helping to build the metaverse with privacy in mind."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/centralizing-apps-settings-in-accounts-center/","date":"2023-01-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Messenger"],"title":"Centralizing Your Apps Settings in Accounts Center","text":"Today, we’re announcing ways to make finding and managing certain settings easier across multiple apps. These improvements can all be found in Accounts Center, which is located in the settings menus for Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. Things like Personal details, Passwords and security, and Ad preferences will now live in a centralized place, so it’ll be easier for people who use multiple apps to manage their settings. For example, you can now easily make your ad topic preferences consistent for Facebook and Instagram accounts by adding those accounts to the same Accounts Center. Learn more about the settings that are moving into Accounts Center. In addition to bringing Ad preferences to Accounts Center, we’re also making improvements to some of the ad settings controls that can help people understand and manage their ads experience across our technologies. First, we’re updating our Data about your activity from Partners’ control, which is now called Activity information from ad partners to help people easily understand how their activity sent from other websites and apps is used to power the ads they see. Second, we’re making it easier for people to understand their options when it comes to seeing ads shown by Meta on other apps and websites. Finally, we know people want more control over the ads they see, which is why we’re exploring new ways to give people the ability to see more ads about the things that interest them, in addition to the existing option of seeing fewer ads about things that don’t interest them. Adding more than one account to the same Accounts Center is optional — if you want to keep your accounts in separate Accounts Centers, you can. For people who choose to do so, they will still have access to the same settings, and can apply them to individual accounts. These changes will begin to go into effect today, and will gradually roll out to everyone on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram in the coming months. We’re also continuing to look for opportunities to centralize additional settings in Accounts Center going forward, so that people can more easily manage their preferences across our products."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/leading-the-fight-against-scraping-for-hire/","date":"2023-01-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta"],"title":"Leading the Fight Against Scraping-for-Hire","text":"Today, Meta is fighting back against a scraping-for-hire service and filed a legal action against Voyager Labs in federal court in California. Voyager Labs is a scraping and surveillance service that improperly collected data from Facebook, Instagram and other websites. We disabled Voyager’s accounts, filed this action to enforce our Terms and Policies and asked the Court to ban Voyager from Facebook and Instagram. Voyager developed and used proprietary software to launch scraping campaigns against Facebook and Instagram, and websites such as Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn and Telegram. Voyager designed its scraping software to use fake accounts to scrape data accessible to a user when logged into Facebook, including users profile information, posts, friends lists, photos and comments. Voyager used a diverse system of computers and networks in different countries to hide its activity, including when Meta subjected the fake accounts to verifications or checks. Voyager did not compromise Facebook, instead it used fake accounts to scrape publicly viewable information. Our lawsuit alleges that Voyager has violated our Terms of Service against fake accounts and unauthorized and automated scraping. We are seeking a permanent injunction against Voyager to protect people against scraping-for-hire services. Companies like Voyager are part of an industry that provides scraping services to anyone regardless of the users they target and for what purpose, including as a way to profile people for criminal behavior. This industry covertly collects information that people share with their community, family and friends, without oversight or accountability, and in a way that may implicate people’s civil rights. These services operate across many platforms and national boundaries, and require a collective effort from platforms, policymakers and civil society to deter the abuse of these capabilities.

We recognize that teens aren’t necessarily as equipped as adults to make decisions about how their online data is used for advertising, particularly when it comes to showing them products available to purchase. For that reason, we’re further restricting the options advertisers have to reach teens, as well as the information we use to show ads to teens. We’re also introducing more teen-specific controls and resources to help them understand how ads work and the reasons why they see certain ads on our apps. These changes reflect research, direct feedback from parents and child developmental experts, UN children’s rights principles and global regulation. The Changes We’re Making Previously, we made changes to how advertisers can reach teens, which included removing the ability for advertisers to target teens based on their interest and activities. We’re announcing further updates to our ad system beginning in February, including removing gender as an option for advertisers to reach teens. Additionally, their engagement on our apps — like following certain Instagram posts or Facebook pages — won’t inform the types of ads they see. Age and location will be the only information about a teen that we’ll use to show them ads. Age and location help us continue to ensure teens see ads that are meant for their age and products and services available where they live. Giving Teens More Control Starting in March, teens will have more ways to manage the types of ads they see on Facebook and Instagram with Ad Topic Controls, expanding on what’s already available. Teens will be able to go to their Ad Preferences within Settings on both apps, and choose See Less or No Preference to further control the types of ads they see. Our Advertising Standards already prohibit ads about restricted topics — like alcohol, financial products and weight loss products and services — to be shown to people under 18 (and older in certain countries). But even when an ad complies with our policies, teens may want to see fewer ads like it. For example, if a teen wants to see fewer ads about a genre of TV show or an upcoming sports season, they should be able to tell us that. Teens can continue to choose to hide any or all ads from a specific advertiser. The topics we already restrict in our policies will be defaulted to See Less, so that teens can’t choose to opt into content that may not be age-appropriate. Helping Teens Understand Their Privacy Options We’ve added a new privacy page with more information for teens about the tools and privacy settings they can use across our technologies, and our teen privacy center has additional resources to help teens understand and manage their privacy across our apps.

We know account security and recovery are top of mind for people, so today we are sharing a behind-the-scenes look at some of the tensions that companies like ours navigate in designing account security tools that help protect people while deterring bad actors. We’re also detailing new security features we’ve rolled out this year and highlighting why it’s critical for people to keep their contact points — like their email or phone numbers — secure and up to date to prevent one of the leading drivers of account compromise. Applying Adversarial Design to Account Security Since sharing our plans last year to expand our support efforts, we’ve continued to stress-test our account security and support systems to understand how bad actors might try to game them. This space is highly adversarial, which means we’re constantly thinking about how our products and our support channels may get abused; we have to keep evolving our defenses and processes in response to malicious actors trying to work around them. This is always a tricky balance because if we tighten account security controls too much, innocent people will have a harder time using and recovering their accounts. If we are too loose with controls, bad actors will have an easier time abusing our systems to compromise people. In fact, we regularly see threat actors target the very systems we put in place to protect people, trying to get accounts taken down. As an example of these types of controls in our account recovery support, we use a variety of signals and verification challenges to help detect suspicious activity and validate legitimate access attempts. These challenges may range from requesting a copy of a person’s ID or confirming a code sent to a device that has previously logged into the account. Taking a Closer Look at Contact Points Once an account recovery request is verified, platforms like ours rely on contact points — like an email address or phone number — listed in someone’s account’s settings as the primary channel to deliver support, like password reset links. Our research shows that people are two times more likely to recover their Facebook account if their contact points are up to date so we can reach them. However, people might lose access to an old email inbox or they may switch phone numbers — this is a challenge that is recognized across our industry. We’ve also seen threat actors target those contact points to gain broad access to someone’s online accounts by using it to reset the passwords for other connected accounts – banking, social media, and others. In fact, when looking at compromised Facebook accounts, we find that one in four began with a person’s contact point being taken over. Product and Support Updates Our work to help people stay safe and in control of their accounts is two-fold. First, to prevent account compromise, we build systems and help people learn how to identify potentially suspicious activity across the internet. Second, to help people who experience access issues, we continue to improve our support offerings. Contact Point Support We’ve built additional ways for people to get back into their accounts when they no longer have access to linked contact points. For instance, in certain cases, people can use recently removed contact points to recover access. As a result, this year we’ve helped eight times more people a day on average get back into their Facebook account than last year when they don’t have access to their listed contact points. We’re also running global in-app prompts across Facebook reminding people to confirm their contact points and exploring alternative ways to confirm people’s identity during the account recovery process on Instagram, including using their friend network. Phishing and Malware Protection To help people stay safe across our apps, we’re continuing to roll out protections and educational initiatives: Protections against malicious links: We know that threat actors often target groups like journalists, activists, political campaigns and businesses (among others) by sending them phishing links or malware. One measure we’ve rolled out to protect against this on Messenger uses our automated systems to direct suspicious messages if they are sent by unconnected users. As with many of our security measures, we’ll use our learnings to inform our broader strategy to protect people. Instagram imposter alerts: We remove Instagram accounts that our automated systems find to be malicious, including ones that impersonate others. But because bad actors may not immediately use accounts maliciously, we’re now testing sending warnings if an account that we suspect may be impersonating someone requests to follow them. In the coming months, we’ll also send warnings if an account that may be impersonating a business sends you a Direct Message. Increased Instagram verified badge visibility: We’re also expanding where the verified badge shows up on Instagram to make it visible in more places, including Stories and Direct Messages, to help people confirm that the accounts they’re interacting with are authentic and verified. Live Chat Support Test While our scaled account recovery tools aim at supporting the majority of account access issues, we know that there are groups of people that could benefit from additional, human-driven support. This year, we’ve carefully grown a small test of a live chat support feature on Facebook, and we’re beginning to see positive results. For example, during the month of October we offered our live chat support option to over a million people in nine countries and we’re now planning to expand this test to more than 30 countries around the world. Instagram Account Access Support We’ve launched instagram.com/hacked to help people to report and resolve account access issues. We’ve also rolled out a way for people to ask their friends to confirm their identity in order to help regain access to their Instagram account. We welcome feedback from the research community and our industry peers as we all navigate balancing these various tensions in protecting people and deterring bad actors."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/12/facebook-dating-age-verification/","date":"2022-12-04T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Bringing Age Verification to Facebook Dating","text":"We’re committed to making sure people have age-appropriate experiences across our technologies, and as part of this work, we’ve been testing age verification tools and using age detection technology to stop people under the age of 18 from accessing experiences meant for adults. Starting today, we’re expanding our age verification test to Facebook Dating in the US. We require people to be at least 18 years old in order to sign up for and access Facebook Dating, and age verification tools will help verify that only adults are using the service and help prevent minors from accessing it. We’re also continuing our partnership with Yoti, a company that specializes in online age verification, so that people have more than one option to choose from to verify their age. How Age Verification on Facebook Dating Works We want to make sure people are placed in experiences that are appropriate for their ages, so we use technology to understand where people have misrepresented how old they are. That’s why we’ve invested in age detection technology to find potential discrepancies in the ages people provide us and the age we think they may be based on our technology. If we detect someone may be under the age of 18 and trying to use Facebook Dating, we will prompt them to verify their age. They will have two options to choose from: Video Selfie: If you choose this option, you’ll see instructions on your screen to guide you through the process. After you take a video selfie, we share a still image from the video with Yoti and nothing else. Yoti’s technology estimates your age based on your facial features, shares that estimate with us and the image is then deleted immediately. The technology cannot recognize your identity — just your age.

ID Upload: You can also choose to upload a form of identification to verify your age. After you upload a copy of your ID, it’ll be encrypted and stored securely, and won’t be visible on your Facebook profile or to other people on the app. Once your age has been verified, you can manage how long your ID is saved for. Our Approach to Age Verification Providing people with more than one option to verify their age allows them to select a method that best fits their needs and preferences. For example, many people don’t always have access to the forms of ID that make verifying age clear. Our age verification tests show that our tools are working to help keep people within age-appropriate experiences. Since we began testing new age verification tools on Instagram in June, we’ve found that approximately four times as many people were more likely to complete our age verification requirements (when attempting to edit their date of birth from under 18 to over 18), equating to hundreds of thousands of people being placed in experiences appropriate for their age. We also were able to stop 96% of the teens who attempted to edit their birthdays from under 18 to 18 or over on Instagram from doing so. And we have found that 81% of people presented with our menu of options chose to use Yoti’s video selfie to verify their age. As we learn more, we plan to bring our age detection technology and verification tools to other countries globally where Facebook Dating is available, and to more experiences that require people to be over 18 to access them."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/12/sharing-poetry-on-facebook-to-help-the-blind-community/","date":"2022-12-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Sharing Poetry on Facebook to Help the Blind Community","text":"After a difficult diagnosis, Dave S. turned fear into hope by sharing his poetry on Facebook as Dave Steele The Blind Poet.

They include: The Community Standards Enforcement Report The Adversarial Threat Report The Widely Viewed Content Report The Oversight Board Quarterly Update Biannual Transparency Report including: Government Requests for User Data Intellectual Property Internet Disruptions Content Restrictions Based on Local Law These reports are all available in the Transparency Center. Here are the key highlights from each one: Community Standards Enforcement Report Highlights While our integrity efforts are always evolving, our goal is to reduce the violating content people see while making fewer mistakes. This means ensuring we take action on content that violates our policies while being more accurate and detecting nuance so that we aren’t taking down things incorrectly, like jokes between friends. Our actions against hate speech-related content decreased from 13.5 million to 10.6 million in Q3 2022 on Facebook because we improved the accuracy of our AI technology. We’ve done this by leveraging data from past user appeals to identify posts that could have been removed by mistake without appropriate cultural context. For example, now we can better recognize humorous terms of endearment used between friends, or better detect words that may be considered offensive or inappropriate in one context but not another. As we improved this accuracy, our proactive detection rate for hate speech also decreased from 95.6% to 90.2% in Q3 2022. Similarly, our actions against content that incites violence decreased from 19.3 million to 14.4 million in Q3 2022 after our improved AI technology was able to better recognize language and emojis used in jest between friends. As we improved our accuracy on this front, our proactive rate for actioning this content decreased from 98.2% to 94.3% in Q3 2022. For bullying and harassment-related content, our proactive rate decreased in Q3 2022 from 76.7% to 67.8% on Facebook, and 87.4% to 84.3% on Instagram. This decrease was due to improved accuracy in our technologies (and a bug in our system that is now resolved). Although our proactive rate dropped in a few areas, prevalence of harmful content on Facebook and Instagram remained relatively consistent between Q2 and Q3. We anticipate continued movement in these areas as our AI improves. On Facebook in Q3, we took action on: 16.7 million pieces of content related to terrorism, an increase from 13.5 million in Q2. This increase was because non-violating videos were added incorrectly to our media-matching technology banks and were removed (though they were eventually restored). 4.1 million pieces of drug content, an increase from 3.9 million in Q2 2022, due to improvements made to our proactive detection technology.n 1.4 billion pieces of spam content, an increase from 734 million in Q2, due to an increased number of adversarial spam incidents in August. On Instagram in Q3, we took action on: 2.2 million pieces of content related to terrorism, from 1.9 million in Q2, due to non-violating videos added incorrectly to our media-matching technology banks and were removed (though they were eventually restored). 2.5 million pieces of drug content, an increase from 1.9 million, due to improvements in our proactive detection technology. Adversarial Threat Report As part of our regular reporting, we’re sharing our third Adversarial Threat Report to provide a qualitative view into the adversarial threats we tackle globally. Last quarter, we investigated and took down three separate covert influence operations in the United States, China and Russia for violating our policy against coordinated inauthentic behavior. Two of these networks (China and Russia) were originally reported on September 27, 2022. Read the full report.

Working with External Experts Our transparency reports allow the public to hold us accountable and help us improve how we talk about our work. We are also committed to undertaking and releasing independent, third-party assessments for our processes, policies and metrics. Earlier this year, we released an EY assessment of our Community Standards Enforcement Report, which concluded that the calculation of the metrics in the report were fairly stated, and that our internal controls are suitably designed and operating effectively. We are also committed to independent oversight and support the Media Rating Council (MRC) as the auditor of our monetized solutions in advertising. Earlier this month, we announced that we received accreditation from the MRC for content-level Brand Safety on Facebook. This quarter, we updated and expanded the section of the Transparency Center on how we engage with stakeholders, including new examples of how their feedback has contributed to the development of our content policies. An Update on Governance The Oversight Board continues to be a valuable source of external perspective and accountability for Meta. The Board’s recommendations help us with our approach to content moderation by driving thoughtful improvements to our policies, operations and products. We respond to every recommendation publicly and have committed to implement or explore the feasibility of implementing 75 percent of those recommendations to date. We also recently announced a community forum taking place in December, which will bring together nearly 6,000 people from 32 countries to discuss conduct in the metaverse. Community forums bring together diverse groups of people to discuss tough issues, consider hard choices and share their perspectives on a set of recommendations. Initiatives like this are part of how we’re exploring new forms of governance, not only to help decentralize decision-making, but also include diverse perspectives in the process."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/protecting-teens-and-their-privacy-on-facebook-and-instagram/","date":"2022-11-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Protecting Teens and Their Privacy on Facebook and Instagram","text":"Today, we’re sharing an update on how we protect young people from harm and seek to create safe, age-appropriate experiences for teens on Facebook and Instagram. Updates to Limiting Unwanted Interactions Last year, we shared some of the measures we take to protect teens from interacting with potentially suspicious adults. For example, we restrict adults from messaging teens they aren’t connected to or from seeing teens in their People You May Know recommendations. In addition to our existing measures, we’re now testing ways to protect teens from messaging suspicious adults they aren’t connected to, and we won’t show them in teens’ People You May Know recommendations. A “suspicious” account is one that belongs to an adult that may have recently been blocked or reported by a young person, for example. As an extra layer of protection, we’re also testing removing the message button on teens’ Instagram accounts when they’re viewed by suspicious adults altogether. Encouraging Teens to Use Our Safety Tools We’ve developed a number of tools so teens can let us know if something makes them feel uncomfortable while using our apps, and we’re introducing new notifications that encourage them to use these tools. For example, we’re prompting teens to report accounts to us after they block someone, and sending them safety notices with information on how to navigate inappropriate messages from adults. In just one month in 2021, more than 100 million people saw safety notices on Messenger. We’ve also made it easier for people to find our reporting tools and, as a result, we saw more than a 70% increase in reports sent to us by minors in Q1 2022 versus the previous quarter on Messenger and Instagram DMs. New Privacy Defaults for Teens on Facebook Starting today, everyone who is under the age of 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into more private settings when they join Facebook, and we’ll encourage teens already on the app to choose these more private settings for: Who can see their friends list Who can see the people, Pages and lists they follow Who can see posts they’re tagged in on their profile Reviewing posts they’re tagged in before the post appears on their profile Who is allowed to comment on their public posts This move comes on the heels of us rolling out similar privacy defaults for teens on Instagram and aligns with our safety-by-design and ‘Best Interests of the Child’ framework. New Tools to Stop the Spread of Teens’ Intimate Images We’re also sharing an update on the work we’re doing to stop the spread of teens’ intimate images online, particularly when these images are used to exploit them — commonly known as “sextortion.” The non-consensual sharing of intimate images can be extremely traumatic and we want to do all we can to discourage teens from sharing these images on our apps in the first place. We’re working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to build a global platform for teens who are worried intimate images they created might be shared on public online platforms without their consent. This platform will be similar to work we have done to prevent the non-consensual sharing of intimate images for adults. It will allow us to help prevent a teen’s intimate images from being posted online and can be used by other companies across the tech industry. We’ve been working closely with NCMEC, experts, academics, parents and victim advocates globally to help develop the platform and ensure it responds to the needs of teens so they can regain control of their content in these horrific situations. We’ll have more to share on this new resource in the coming weeks. We’re also working with Thorn and their NoFiltr brand to create educational materials that reduce the shame and stigma surrounding intimate images, and empower teens to seek help and take back control if they’ve shared them or are experiencing sextortion. We found that more than 75% of people that we reported to NCMEC for sharing child exploitative content shared the content out of outrage, poor humor, or disgust, and with no apparent intention of harm. Sharing this content violates our policies, regardless of intent. We’re planning to launch a new PSA campaign that encourages people to stop and think before resharing those images online and to report them to us instead. Anyone seeking support and information related to sextortion can visit our education and awareness resources, including the Stop Sextortion hub on the Facebook Safety Center, developed with Thorn. We also have our guide for parents on how to talk to their teens about intimate images on the Education hub of our Family Center."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/protecting-footballers-and-fans-during-the-fifa-world-cup/","date":"2022-11-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Product News","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Protecting Footballers and Fans on Our Apps During the FIFA World Cup","text":"Over the next month, football fans across the globe will use our apps to connect around the FIFA World Cup. While most will be rooting for the teams and players competing for the championship, unfortunately there will likely be some who want to be abusive towards others — just like we see offline. Before the competition kicks off, we’re sharing more details about our policies against abuse, and the range of tools we’ve developed to help keep footballers — and everyone else — safe. Our Rules Against Abuse We have clear rules against bullying, violent threats and hate speech — and we don’t want it on our apps. As well as responding to reports from our community, outside of private messages we also use technology to proactively look for content that might break these rules. Where our technology thinks a piece of content may be violating it will take action, whether that’s sending it to our teams for review or — if it’s really confident — deleting it automatically. Between April and June this year, we took action on more than 17 million pieces of hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, and found more than 90% of that before anyone reported it. Features to Help Keep Footballers Safe In response to feedback from our community, we’ve developed new features — and updated existing ones — to help footballers and fans alike stay safe on our apps and protect them from abuse. People can turn direct message (DM) requests off completely on Instagram, meaning they won’t receive messages from anyone they don’t follow. They can also choose who can comment on their posts or turn off comments altogether, on a post-by-post basis. But some public figures have told us they don’t want to turn off DM requests completely, because they like hearing from fans and other members of their community. That’s why we developed Hidden Words. When turned on, this feature automatically sends DM requests — including Story replies — containing offensive words, phrases and emojis to a hidden folder so you don’t have to see them. It also hides comments with these terms under your posts. Since launching Hidden Words last year, more than one in five people with more than 10,000 followers have turned it on. We’re also testing turning it on by default for people with creator accounts, which includes many footballers playing in the World Cup. We launched Limits last year, which, when turned on, hides comments and DM requests from people who don’t follow you or who only followed you recently. Limits is particularly useful for public figures who experience sudden spikes of comments and DMs — after a football game, for example — as our research shows that most negativity towards them comes from non-followers or recent followers. When we detect that someone may be experiencing a rush of comments or DM requests, we’ll prompt them to turn on Limits. Blocking is a quick and effective way to stop someone from interacting with you. Now when you block someone on Instagram, you can also block any other accounts they may already have, or may create in the future, making it even harder for them to contact you. Encouraging More Supportive Behavior on Instagram We’re also continuing to explore ways to prevent people from posting abusive content in the first place. We already use artificial intelligence to detect when someone is trying to post a comment that might be offensive, and warn them it may break our rules. In a given week, people edit or delete their comment 50% of the time after seeing these warnings. We also recently introduced new nudges that encourage people to pause and rethink before replying to a potentially offensive comment. These nudges are live now for people whose apps are set to English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Chinese or Arabic. When people send a DM request to a creator or public figure for the first time, we’ll remind them to be respectful, so they remember there’s a real person on the other side of their message. Educating Footballers About Our Safety Tools and Policies We regularly speak to football players, teams and associations around the world — including FIFA — to make sure they know about our latest safety policies and features, and we listen carefully to their feedback. We’re also working closely with teams competing in the World Cup to help their players turn on our safety tools — for example Hidden Words — and we’re reminding footballers in the tournament to check them with a prompt at the top of their Instagram Feed. Working With Law Enforcement We cooperate with law enforcement in their investigations and respond to valid legal requests for information in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. As with all law enforcement requests, we’ll push back if they’re too broad, inconsistent with human rights or not legally valid. While we know no one thing will fix abusive behavior, we’re committed to continuing to develop tools to protect our community, and to working closely with the football industry to help keep our apps a safe place for footballers and fans."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/metas-progress-on-combating-climate-change/","date":"2022-11-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Meta","Sustainability"],"title":"Sharing Our Progress on Combating Climate Change","text":"Update on November 11, 2022 at 8:00AM PT: Meta has become a founding member of the Asia Clean Energy Coalition, which will advocate for eliminating barriers to corporate renewable energy purchasing in Asia. Originally published on November 6, 2022 at 11:00PM PT: As leaders and experts convene in Egypt for COP27, we’re outlining progress on our climate commitments and announcing expanded tools to help our communities take action against climate change. Like previous years, we’re focusing on how we can leverage our technologies, apps and operational strategy to demonstrate our commitment to solutions. Responsible Operations Since 2020, we’ve achieved net zero greenhouse gas emissions for our global operations as they are now supported by 100% renewable energy. We’ve also set ambitious goals to achieve net zero value chain emissions and to restore more water than we consume in our global operations in 2030. Reducing our emissions and helping our suppliers to do the same is our top priority to reach our climate target. This year, we announced a new partnership with Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify and McKinsey Sustainability to launch Frontier, an advanced market commitment to help scale emerging carbon removal technologies that are crucial to tackling climate change. Elevating Authoritative Climate Information As evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have an essential role to play during global crises in connecting people to accurate information. That’s why we’ve built and expanded a number of tools to provide authoritative information about the realities of climate change. We’ve created a new page that explains our holistic approach to addressing climate content and misinformation on our apps. Our investment in the Climate Misinformation Grant Program is forging new partnerships and initiatives, and our Public Ad Library gives an extra layer of transparency into all climate ads. We’ve expanded the Climate Science Center and it’s now available in 165 countries. We’re also expanding Climate Inform Labels, a tool that adds links to Facebook posts about climate change and connects people with expert-backed information in the Climate Science Center. We’ve launched a Climate InfoFinder tool that enables people to search for trusted information about climate change and link to this content directly in comment threads. We worked with partners to help launch our first Climate Science Literacy Initiative. Its goal is to pre-bunk climate misinformation by running ads across our products and apps that feature five of the most common techniques used to misrepresent climate change. Empowering Communities to Take Action After our largest-ever global survey about climate change this past spring painted a picture of deep concern among respondents, we have seen meaningful change happen when communities come together. More than 40 million people around the world are part of at least one of the 24,000 Facebook Groups dedicated to the discovery, protection and appreciation of the earth and our environment. We’re testing a new feature in Facebook Groups, called Climate Pledges, which leverages the power of communities to enable climate action. Developed with inputs from the UN Environment Programme and UN’s ActNow, the Climate Pledges feature contains expert-backed climate solutions to spark conversation and help people understand the most impactful actions they can take. Group admins can choose the solutions most relevant to their communities, invite group members to join, provide support and offer tips to keep everyone accountable. For example, a solar panel group admin may choose to activate the “Switch to renewable energy” pledge and group members commit to joining it together. Group members can also discover relevant content, including Reels, from across Facebook which they can then localize to their communities. Helping Equip Our Partners With Resources Our Boost Guide to Green Program has reached 1.3 million small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) on how to become greener. We released a new report in October, in partnership with Accenture, which explores the relationship between SMBs and climate action, and how digital technology can support them. Our Data for Good program also provided data from our small business surveys to the World Trade Organization, which published a report on small businesses’ experiences and challenges related to climate change. We also launched the Climate Perceptions Index, developed by the Social Progress Imperative, using data from our 2022 Climate Change Opinion Survey. It offers information on the societal implications of climate change with new data on people’s awareness of climate change, their perception of its risks and their commitment to climate action. Finally, we have collaborated with the World Resources Institute on prevention campaigns to reduce food waste, reaching more than 40 million people in Germany and the UK. We’ll use the insights we gain from these campaigns to inform future work."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/new-creators-tools-facebook-and-instagram/","date":"2022-11-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News"],"title":"Introducing New Tools for Creators to Build Businesses on Facebook and Instagram","text":"At Meta, we’re building products to help creators reach an audience, grow their communities and earn a living. During Creator Week 2022, we’re inviting creators around the world to join us in growing their careers, connecting with peers and building a future together. We’re also announcing new ways creators can earn money on Facebook and Instagram. Updates to Digital Collectibles Creators will soon be able to make their own digital collectibles on Instagram and sell them to fans, both on and off Instagram. They’ll have an end-to-end toolkit — from creation (starting on the Polygon blockchain) and showcasing, to selling. People can easily support their favorite creators by buying their digital collectibles directly within Instagram. We’re testing these new features with a small group of creators in the US first, and hope to expand to more countries soon. We’re also expanding the types of digital collectibles that you can showcase on Instagram to include video and adding support for the Solana blockchain and Phantom wallet, in addition to the blockchains and wallets that we already support. Lastly, information for select collections where the metadata has been enriched by OpenSea, such as collection name and descriptions, will now be available on Instagram. Audience Support for Creators We’re making it easier for people to show appreciation for their favorite creators across our apps, which helps creators strengthen their community and build their business. Subscriptions on Instagram We’re expanding access to subscriptions on Instagram to all eligible creators in the U.S., so more creators can earn predictable income and connect more deeply with their most engaged followers. Since launching subscriptions earlier this year, we’ve seen creators like Cole Sprouse (@colesprouse), Alan Chow (@alanchikinchow) and Skai Jackson (@skaijackson) use subscriptions to get even closer to their most engaged supporters. Stars and Gifts We are making it easier for people to discover Stars on Facebook by automatically enabling Stars on public creator content — including Reels. This means that people can learn about and use Stars in more places across Facebook. We are testing with a select number of creators globally. For creators already using Stars, we’re launching new features to make it easier to earn Stars and interact with Star senders: Bringing Stars Party to Reels. A Stars Party is a Stars community challenge that ends in a celebration if the creator reaches their goal. Testing a new set of virtual gifts tailored to specific content. For example, if you’re watching a puppy reel from your favorite pet creator, you’ll be able to send that creator a dog-themed gift. Giving creators more tools to engage with Stars senders, like adding a filter in Comments Manager that displays all of a creator’s Stars comments in one place. In this surface, creators will be able to reply to multiple comments at once. Bringing Stars to non-video public content like photos and text posts. We’re introducing gifts on Instagram, starting with Reels, so creators have a new way to earn money from fans who love their Reels. To support their favorite creators, fans can send gifts on Reels by purchasing Stars within Instagram. We’re testing this with a small group of creators in the US first, and hope to expand to more creators soon. Professional Mode for Facebook Profiles We’re launching professional mode for Facebook profiles, a new profile setting that allows creators around the world to build a public presence while maintaining their personal Facebook experience. Professional mode offers creators, and anyone that wants to become a creator, a set of tools and opportunities to begin growing a global community from their personal profile. With professional mode, creators can become eligible to earn money through Stars, ads on Facebook Reels, in-stream ads and Reels Play. They will also have access to content and audience analytics, educational resources and more."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/fundraise-for-nonprofits-giving-season/","date":"2022-10-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"New Way to Support Nonprofits This Giving Season","text":"Today we’re announcing a new way of matching donations this giving season that helps organizations raise money long-term.

Over 80% of donations this year were from fundraisers created by people and shared with their friends and family, and is the #1 way that people donate on Facebook. The data above shows our community’s journey to raising $7B for nonprofits, and identifies the top fundraisers per year, based on donation amount. The all-time top fundraisers since 2015, ranked by donation amount. On Facebook, the fundraisers with the most dollars raised in 2022 were related to Ukraine relief, Ramadan and animal protection. On Instagram, the fundraisers with the most donations this year were related to Ukraine relief, gun safety and the floods in Pakistan. One example is from Clare Staples, who founded the nonprofit Skydog Sanctuary to reunite horses that have been separated and also rescue wild mustangs and burros. She uses Facebook and Instagram to help raise the money she needs to care for the horses, find volunteers and share uplifting stories. Our technologies help organizations like Clare’s nonprofit connect directly with its large community of supporters."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/facebook-communities-summit-2022/","date":"2022-10-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing New Features to Facebook Groups","text":"Building community is core to Facebook’s mission in bringing the world closer together, and while community has made its way into every corner of the app, Groups continue to be the central place where people go to do more together. In fact, most people on Facebook are members of at least 15 active groups, and there are more than 100 million group joins every day. Today, we’re hosting the Facebook Communities Summit for the sixth year, announcing a number of changes to help people engage more deeply around the things they care about, strengthen community culture, and make it easier for admins to manage their groups. New Ways to Engage More Deeply With Your Communities As people come to Facebook to discover content and communities, we’re adding more ways to connect over shared interests. Reels in Groups let you express your voice in your communities through creative and immersive videos. With Reels now in Groups, community members can share information, tell stories and connect on a deeper level. Imagine people in a makeup-obsessed group sharing their latest techniques and beauty finds with fellow members. Group admins and members can also add creative elements such as audio, text overlay and filters on top of their videos before sharing to bring their stories to life. The ability to share a public Facebook event for your community to your Instagram story. Whether you’re a group admin hosting a meet-up to celebrate a community milestone, or a group member sharing your passion with friends, this feature can help you showcase your community more broadly. We’re testing updates to your Group profile to make it easier to foster community relationships and connect with other members. With these new updates you can: Customize the information in your About Me section to highlight information you want to share with your community. This can help both admins and members learn more about one another and create content that best reflects the group’s interests. Add an indicator to your profile if you’re open to messaging. This can help other like-minded members know that you’re willing to connect over shared interests. Earlier this year, we announced that admins can begin to create channels as a way to connect with their groups in smaller, more casual settings. For example, Community Chats, which lets people connect in real time around the topics they care about via text, audio and video, is now available in more than 140 countries globally. Black Girls Culinary, a Facebook group where people share their latest recipes, uses Community Chats to create chat channels for a topic like Meatless Mondays and audio channels to talk through cooking tips in real time. They can also seamlessly add an event chat to Group events, allowing people to discuss events before, during, and after they take place. We’re also testing the ability for group admins and moderators to create view-only chats to send one-way communications to all of their members without having to actively maintain or respond to messages in the chat, so they can stay up-to-date on important group information. Admins and moderators can also use an admin-only chat for in-the-moment collaboration. Admin-Curated Experiences to Build Culture Admins have new tools to help them effectively manage and drive their group’s culture forward in engaging, useful and responsible ways: Community Contributions: We’re testing a new way for admins to highlight top contributing members, who can earn points by taking on an active role with a set of responsibilities in the community or for receiving reactions and comments on posts. For example, gaming communities can identify helpful tips that other members share about new features, games and characters. By accruing points, top contributing members will earn badges to feature on their group profiles, making it easier for admins to select members for roles. Socializer: We’re testing a new role for admins to recognize active members who help others feel welcomed, connected and motivated to contribute in a community. For instance, Socializers in music festival communities can be recognized for sharing their festival experiences and motivating others to do the same by sharing photos and videos. Admin Assist: We’re sharing new updates on this feature, which helps admins efficiently moderate their groups by automatically taking action based on specific criteria they set: New treatments for false information: To help ensure content is more reliable for the broader community, group admins can automatically move posts containing information rated as false by third-party fact-checkers (whether the posts are identified as containing false information before or after being posted in their group) to pending posts so that the admins can review the posts before deleting them. Learn more about our third-party fact-checking program here. Daily Digest: Group admins can easily review how Admin Assist helps them manage their community with a new daily summary of actions taken in a community based on the criteria admins have set. Flagged by Facebook: As we shared in our recent Community Standards Enforcement Report, we’re testing an extension within Flagged by Facebook that gives some admins of eligible groups the ability to use additional context and allow some content that might otherwise be flagged for removal as bullying and harassment. We use a variety of criteria to define a group’s eligibility for this feature, including that the group admin must not have been the admin of a group we’ve previously removed. Through this test, an admin for a group of fish tank enthusiasts could allow a flagged comment that called a fish “fatty,” which was not intended to be offensive. We still require groups to follow our policies and will remove violating content that’s reported to us. Community Accelerator Program The 2022 Community Accelerator Program provides community leaders with four months of training, mentorship and funding to help them deepen their community’s impact through Meta technologies. Today, we’re announcing this year’s selected participants from around the globe."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/creating-an-emotional-support-community-on-facebook/","date":"2022-10-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Creating an Emotional Support Community on Facebook","text":"After sharing his thoughts on Facebook about feeling lonely, Martin N. realized others needed an outlet too.

We’ve shared our findings with industry peers, security researchers and policymakers to help us improve our collective defenses against this threat. Most importantly, because these apps were accessible in third-party app stores, we’re encouraging people to be cautious when downloading a new app that asks for social media credentials and providing practical steps to help people stay safe. What We’ve Found Our security researchers have found more than 400 malicious Android and iOS apps this year that were designed to steal Facebook login information and compromise people’s accounts. These apps were listed on the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store and disguised as photo editors, games, VPN services, business apps and other utilities to trick people into downloading them. Some examples include: Photo editors, including those that claim to allow you to “turn yourself into a cartoon” VPNs claiming to boost browsing speed or grant access to blocked content or websites Phone utilities such as flashlight apps that claim to brighten your phone’s flashlight Mobile games falsely promising high-quality 3D graphics Health and lifestyle apps such as horoscopes and fitness trackers Business or ad management apps claiming to provide hidden or unauthorized features not found in official apps by tech platforms. This is a highly adversarial space and while our industry peers work to detect and remove malicious software, some of these apps evade detection and make it onto legitimate app stores. We’ve reported these malicious apps to our peers at Apple and Google and they have been taken down from both app stores prior to this report’s publication. We are also alerting people who may have unknowingly self-compromised their accounts by downloading these apps and sharing their credentials, and are helping them to secure their accounts. How Do These Apps Work? Malicious developers create malware apps disguised as apps with fun or useful functionality — like cartoon image editors or music players — and publish them on mobile app stores. To cover up negative reviews by people who have spotted the defunct or malicious nature of the apps, developers may publish fake reviews to trick others into downloading the malware. When a person installs the malicious app, it may ask them to “Login With Facebook” before they are able to use its promised features. If they enter their credentials, the malware steals their username and password. If the login information is stolen, attackers could potentially gain full access to a person’s account and do things like message their friends or access private information. How You Can Stay Safe There are many legitimate apps that offer the features listed above or that may ask you to sign in with Facebook in a safe and secure way. Cybercriminals know how popular these types of apps are and use these themes to trick people and steal their accounts and information. Malware apps often have telltale signs that differentiate them from legitimate apps. Here are a few things to consider before logging into a mobile app with your Facebook account: Requiring social media credentials to use the app: Is the app unusable if you don’t provide your Facebook information? For example, be suspicious of a photo-editing app that needs your Facebook login and password before allowing you to use it. The app’s reputation: Is the app reputable? Look at its download count, ratings and reviews, including negative ones. Promised features: Does the app provide the functionality it says it will, either before or after logging in? Here are a few examples of malware apps we found to provide no functionality until you log in with your social media account. What to Do If You’re Affected If you believe you’ve downloaded a malicious app and have logged in with your social media or other online credentials, we recommend that you delete the app from your device immediately and follow the following instructions to secure your accounts: Reset and create new strong passwords. Never reuse your password across multiple websites. Enable two-factor authentication, preferably using an Authenticator app, to add an extra security layer to your account. Turn on log-in alerts so you’ll be notified if someone is trying to access your account. Be sure to review your previous sessions to ensure you recognize which devices have access to your account. We also encourage people to report malicious applications that compromise Meta accounts to us through our Data Abuse Bounty program.

Along with updates from your friends, Groups and Pages, Facebook recommends posts from creators and communities you may not know about for you to enjoy and discuss. What you see in your Feed is uniquely personalized to your interests through machine learning. Today, we’re announcing new ways to customize what you see in your Facebook Feed so you can discover what’s most relevant to you. Now, you can select Show more or Show less on posts from the people and communities you’re connected to and posts that Facebook recommends to you. Selecting Show more will temporarily increase the ranking score for that post and posts like it. If you select Show less, you’ll temporarily decrease its ranking score. By offering more ways to incorporate direct feedback into Feed ranking, we’re making our artificial intelligence systems smarter and more responsive. We’ll periodically show this on posts in Feed. Soon, you can choose to Show more or Show less on posts by tapping into the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner. We are also starting to test this feature in Reels. Additionally, we’re continuing to explore ways to help you customize how much content you see in Feed from the friends and family, Groups, Pages and public figures you’re connected to. These tools — as well as Favorites, snooze and reconnect— can be found in Feed Preferences. Features like these can help you discover more of the content that’s valuable to you, so you can see more of what you want and less of what you don’t. As with every product change we make, we’ll use direct feedback to continually refine our approach."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/accounts-center-facebook-and-instagram/","date":"2022-09-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Product News"],"title":"Making it Easier to Switch Between and Create New Accounts and Profiles on Facebook and Instagram","text":"Today, we’re introducing new features that will make it easier for people on Facebook and Instagram to access, create and navigate between multiple accounts and profiles. We know that many people use more than one of our apps to pursue different interests, reach a broader audience or share different aspects of who they are with different groups of people. With that in mind, we’re simplifying the process of creating and switching between accounts and profiles. Easily Switch Between Facebook and Instagram First, we’re introducing a new profile-switching interface that will make it easier to stay on top of notifications and navigate between Facebook and Instagram. People will be able to easily switch between their Facebook and Instagram profiles if they’ve added them to the same Accounts Center. Additionally, people can now see their Facebook and Instagram profiles in one place. Notifications will also be conveniently displayed for each profile, making it easier to stay up to date on activity across Facebook and Instagram. We’re testing this new experience globally on iOS, Android and web. Quickly Create New Accounts and Profiles We’re also introducing a new account registration and login flow that will enable people to more easily log in and create new accounts across Facebook and Instagram. People new to our products can create a Facebook or Instagram account, and then use that account to sign up for additional ones. And people who have both a Facebook and an Instagram account can now easily use login information from one app to access the other, as long as their accounts are in the same Accounts Center. We’re testing this new experience globally on iOS and Android. Building With Safety in Mind Each of these new features uses the Meta brand to make it clear and easy to understand that you are interacting with a feature that works across more than one Meta technology, and to make the process as streamlined as possible. As always, account security and privacy are top of mind for us, and existing security features will still apply to the updates we are announcing today. For example, if someone turns on two-factor authentication for their Facebook account, then an unrecognized device can’t log into their Facebook account with their Instagram login information. Additionally, people will be notified when a new account is created using their existing account and when an account is added to their Accounts Center, so you can confidently stay up to date on activity across all of your accounts. Finally, people can manage which profile appears in the profile-switching experience, and which accounts can log into each other. While these changes are currently limited to Facebook and Instagram, we’ll continue to explore how to improve cross-app features across all of our technologies."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/womens-health-on-facebook/","date":"2022-09-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Creating a Safe Space to Learn About Women’s Health on Facebook","text":"Victoria M. wanted a safe place to learn more about women’s health, so she created Copa Menstrual México Facebook Group.

Today, Mark Zuckerberg announced we’ll begin testing the ability for people to start Community Chats in Messenger in the coming weeks, allowing people to create a Facebook Group, start chats and audio channels, and invite others to join their new group all within the app. We’ll also be expanding Community Chats to even more Facebook Groups. Why Community Chats? Community Chats let people connect more deeply with communities in real time around the topics they care about in multiple formats, including text, audio and video. The experience seamlessly blends Messenger and Facebook Groups to allow people to connect when, where and how they want. Admins can now start a conversation about a topic and get in-the-moment responses instead of waiting for people to comment on a post. And, rather than navigating multiple topics in a single Messenger group chat, the person who creates the Community Chat can organize chats into categories so group members can easily find what’s most interesting to them. For example, a band’s fan group could have a “Breaking News” category with chats dedicated to new album drops, tour dates and group activities. How It Works Check out how Vanessa Yaeger, admin of the Women Who Surf Facebook Group, uses Community Chats to bring her members together in real time for a spontaneous IRL meetup.

Admins can choose from several options to help their communities connect. They can start a chat for group members around a specific topic, an event chat for an outing or meetup, a view-only broadcast chat for admins to announce group-wide updates and an admin-only chat to collaborate with admins and moderators. Admins can also create audio channels so group members can share live commentary or receive real-time support. Participants also have the option to enable video once they’re in the audio channel. For example, the admin of a Facebook Group for chemistry students could create audio channels for study groups during finals season, and participants can turn on video for live tutoring. Community Chats are only accessible to members of a group. To learn more about how to use Community Chats, check out the Facebook Community Blog. Given the more public nature of Community Chats, we’ve developed a robust suite of tools to help admins easily manage both chat and audio experiences. This includes moderation capabilities like blocking, muting or suspending group members, and removing members or messages, as well as Admin Assist, which allows admins to set custom criteria that will automatically suspend users, remove reported messages, and stop messages from ineligible authors or containing violating content from being sent. Members of Community Chats can also report messages to group admins or Meta, block users or leave a chat at any time. Learn more about privacy and safety controls in Community Chats. What’s Next We’re committed to building messaging experiences that help people connect with their communities, friends and families. As Community Chats rolls out to more people and groups around the world, we’ll continue exploring new features and capabilities to make it easier to connect with one another."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/safety-and-privacy-in-community-chats/","date":"2022-09-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Messenger","Meta"],"title":"How We Approach Safety and Privacy in Community Chats","text":"Community Chats in Messenger and Facebook allow people to connect more deeply with communities in real time around the topics they care about via text, audio or video. Messenger already helps more than a billion people stay connected to friends and family, and this feature helps people also connect with communities over shared interests. Since they’re designed for more public conversations, we’re explaining our approach to making Community Chats trusted spaces. Empowering Admins, Moderators and Members Admins and moderators can manage their Community Chats with a robust suite of content and moderation tools to help keep people safe. Admin Assist allows them to set custom criteria that will automatically suspend users, remove reported messages and stop messages from ineligible authors or containing violating content from being sent. They can also manually delete messages, remove group members from chats and report messages to Meta. Members of Community Chats can report a group, category, chat or message, and they can block people or leave a chat at any time. People who are blocked or removed from a group won’t be able to view its Community Chat content. If someone joins a chat with a person they’ve blocked on Facebook, they will be able to see that person’s content but will receive a pop-up notice that the person they’ve blocked is present. Audio channels in Community Chats will follow the same standards as other Messenger audio calls, providing people with controls to manage their experience. This includes the ability to block or remove someone, and to report an audio channel or participant to both Facebook or an admin. Protecting Your Privacy We know people will want to understand how they can protect their privacy, and it’s important to understand how and when you will be visible in a Community Chat. Any member of a Facebook Group can join its Community Chats and see their history, with the exception of admin-only or invite-only chats. Private conversations should be reserved for private Messenger chats. We will continue to respect your existing privacy settings in Community Chats, and private accounts will work the same way they do today. For example, your account’s name and basic profile information will be visible to other members of a Community Chat, but Feed content by private accounts will be visible only to friends or followers. If a member of a Community Chat sends you a private message on Messenger, those messages will adhere to your message delivery controls, which means you can decide whether the request is sent to your chats list, your message requests folder or whether you want to receive it at all. Finally, as with other parts of Meta, we collect information from Messenger and Facebook primarily to provide the service, improve the product experience and keep people safe and secure. We’re always improving our data collection processes, as well as carefully monitoring and verifying how we use data. Learn more about how we collect and use information from Messenger and Facebook. Keeping Communities Safe How we treat content and data in Community Chats is different from that of private messaging in Messenger. Given their more public nature, we use machine learning to detect and remove a wider breadth of potentially harmful content than in private Messenger chats, and we do not currently allow message forwarding from Community Chats. While all chats are subject to Facebook’s Community Standards, Community Chats are subject to these policies regardless of whether they’ve been reported. This means Facebook may automatically take down violating content or media, and repeated content violations could lead to a suspension of the feature, a Facebook Group or a user’s account. And, Facebook content shared in Community Chats that has been rated sensitive or misleading will be labeled as such so people can better decide what to read, trust or share. Learn more about our approach to content moderation and enforcement. An Ongoing Project We are excited by the opportunities that Community Chats will give people to interact and deepen relationships in their online communities. We know this is a work in progress, and we’re thinking carefully about the best ways to protect people and create the right tools to manage these communities. We’ll continue to consult with the people who use our products, as well as safety and policy experts, to build the best experience as we move forward."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/deterring-scraping-by-protecting-facebook-identifiers/","date":"2022-09-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Deterring Scraping By Protecting Facebook Identifiers","text":"As part of an ongoing series about addressing data misuse, we recently shared an update on how our External Data Misuse (EDM) team works to safeguard people against clone sites. Today, we’re detailing our approach on deterring scraping of Facebook Identifiers (FBIDs) on Facebook. What Is an Identifier? Most companies use unique identifiers within the URLs of their website. Identifiers are a way to uniquely reference people or content such as posts, pictures and videos. Within Facebook, these identifiers are known as FBIDs and we use them to load content for people. Scraping is the automated collection of data from a website or app and can be both authorized and unauthorized. Unauthorized scraping often involves guessing identifiers, or using purchased identifiers to scrape people’s data. In some cases, scrapers collect identifiers and cross-reference phone numbers or other publicly-available data to create reusable data sets that are sometimes sold for profit. We created Pseudonymized Facebook Identifiers (PFBIDs), which combine timestamps and FBIDs to generate a unique time-rotating identifier. As we phase out the ability to access the original identifiers, this helps deter unauthorized data scraping by making it harder for attackers to guess, connect and repeatedly access data. These identifiers are not designed to prevent browser tools from removing tracking components from the URL. We use this process to better protect people’s privacy from certain types of enumeration and time-delayed attacks while preserving the ability to have long-lived links. You can read additional updates and insights on our privacy initiatives on our Privacy Matters page."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/08/facebook-widely-viewed-content-report-q2-2022/","date":"2022-08-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Widely Viewed Content Report, Second Quarter 2022","text":"Today, we’re publishing the Widely Viewed Content Report (WVCR) for the second quarter of 2022. This report highlights the most-viewed organic content in Feed on Facebook in the US, including domains, links, Pages and posts. It includes content recommended by Facebook and excludes advertising content. See the full report and Companion Guide for more information. Updates and Enforcements This report shows five links and one post that we removed from Facebook for violating our Inauthentic Behavior (IB) policy. Content with links to the domains responsible for these violations can no longer be created/shared on Facebook. Similarly, the Page responsible for the post and its content are no longer accessible on Facebook for violating our Inauthentic Behavior policy We also note in this report that we’ve removed one of the top posts for violating our Intellectual Property policy. We removed it after receiving a complete copyright report for the content. Learn more about how we protect intellectual property rights. Insights from the WVCR help inform how we update our existing policies and products, and develop new ones to address harmful or otherwise objectionable content. For example, we’ve been testing new ways to reduce clickbait, engagement bait and spam. While we’re seeing improvements from these tests, we will need to continually evaluate and refine our approach given how spam operators try to adapt their tactics to evade our new ways of detecting them. We’ll continue to test and improve solutions to reduce engagement bait, misinformation and content from Pages that repeatedly violate our Community Standards. In Focus: Foreign Spammers Marketing to US Audiences In our previous WVCR report, we shared that the ninth-most viewed link on Facebook with over 33 million views in the first quarter of this year was alltrendytees[.]com. After the Integrity Institute had flagged it to us, we investigated and blocked this domain for violating our IB policy. Our investigation linked this domain to GearLaunch, a Bangladesh-based e-commerce firm. In total, we removed over 500 inauthentic and authentic accounts, Pages and Groups run by these spammers. We also blocked additional domains that engaged in the same behavior and were linked to GearLaunch. We will keep taking action against this activity because we know that adversarial actors like this may try to come back and create new websites. In addition to running fake accounts to spam people with links and drive them to off-platform domains selling print-on-demand t-shirts, they also engaged in what we call “guiding adversarial activity” where they facilitated and coached people on how to evade detection and enforcement. They generated “how-to” YouTube videos where they taught people how to deceptively build their audience while posing as Americans and monetize by selling topical t-shirts through their print-on-demand websites. T-shirt designs ranged from hobby-related images like fishing to professional areas like accounting to political slogans and images. This case continues the trend we’ve previously reported where IB operators pretend that they’re based in one country, when in reality, they’re running their monetization schemes out of a different one. This often includes foreign spammers and scammers flocking to any relevant everyday interests or hot-button issues that are relevant in a particular country or region — like an election or a socio-political crisis — to amass an audience and monetize their attention. For example, we’ve seen financially-motivated actors from around the world leverage significant events — like the Canadian trucker protests, the US 2020 elections, the war in Ukraine and the recent election in the Philippines — to build audiences and make money. We expect to see attempts at this kind of activity increase in the US as we get closer to the midterms. So we will stay vigilant to it and respond whenever we see it, while also fine tuning our detection and enforcement systems to make sure we stay ahead of it.

This update includes: The Community Standards Enforcement Report (CSER) for the second quarter of 2022; The Widely Viewed Content Report (WVCR) for the second quarter of 2022; The Oversight Board Quarterly Update for the second quarter of 2022; Updates on our work to protect safety and expression and New data on our third-party fact checker program. Earlier this month we also released our Quarterly Adversarial Threat Report, which provides an in-depth, qualitative view into the different types of adversarial threats we tackle globally as well as our approach to the upcoming elections in Brazil and the United States. Community Standards Enforcement Report Highlights We continue to make steady progress on a number of areas, including bullying and harassment. As we continue to improve our AI technology, the proactive detection rate of bullying and harassment content on Facebook increased from 67% in Q1 2022 to 76.8% in Q2 2022 and on Instagram from 83.8% in Q1 2022 to 87.4% in Q2 2022. On Facebook in Q2: Bullying and Harassment: Prevalence was 0.08-0.09%, from 0.09% in Q1. We took action on 8.2 million pieces of it in Q2, from 9.5 million in Q1. Hate Speech: Prevalence remained at 0.02% or two views per 10,000. We took action on 13.5 million pieces of it in Q2, from 15.1 million pieces in Q1. Violence and Incitement: Prevalence remained 0.03% or three views per 10,000. We took action on 19.3 million pieces of it in Q2, from 21.7 million pieces in Q1. On Instagram in Q2: Bullying and Harassment: Prevalence was 0.04-0.05%, from 0.05-0.06% in Q1. We took action on 6.1 million pieces of it, from seven million in Q1. Hate Speech: Prevalence was 0.01-0.02% or one to two views per 10,000, from 0.02% in Q1. We took action on 3.8 million pieces of it in Q2, from 3.4 million pieces in Q1. Violence and Incitement: Prevalence remained 0.01-0.02% or two views per 10,000. We took action on 3.7 million pieces of it in Q2, from 2.7 million pieces in Q1. As part of our work to constantly improve the metrics we share in this report, we have updated our appeals methodology to account for all instances where content was submitted for additional review, including times when people told us they disagreed with our decision. As new regulations continue to roll out around the globe, we are focused on the obligations they create for us and how those obligations might affect our ability to keep prevalence of violating content on our apps low, minimize enforcement mistakes and conduct sufficient due-diligence as part of our safety and security processes. Oversight Board Highlights Expansion of the Board’s Scope: The board will soon issue a new type of binding judgment on cases: whether or not we should apply a warning screen to some pieces of content. While the board has already been able to apply binding decisions on whether to take down or leave up pieces of content, this expansion will empower them further by giving them more input on how content appears and is distributed to people across our platforms. Newsworthiness: As a result of a recommendation from the Oversight Board, we’re releasing data on the number of newsworthy allowances we made over a calendar year. We’re committing to release these numbers on a regular basis moving forward. From June 2021 to June 2022, we documented 68 newsworthiness allowances, of which, 13 (~20%) of those were issued for posts by politicians. This data, along with examples of and details on these allowances, are now available in our Transparency Center. Crisis Policy Protocol: During crises, we assess on and off-platform risks of imminent harm and respond with specific policy and product actions. Based on a recommendation from the Oversight Board — and to strengthen our existing work — we are publishing our Crisis Policy Protocol (CPP) to codify our content policy response to crises. This framework helps to assess crisis situations that may require a new or unique policy response. The CPP guides our use of targeted crisis policy interventions in a timely manner that is consistent with observed risks and past interventions. As a result, this helps our crisis policy response to be more calibrated and sustainable, as we seek to balance a consistent global response with adapting to quickly changing conditions. Protocol development included original research, consultations with over 50 global external experts in national security, conflict prevention, hate speech, humanitarian response and human rights. Learn more here and here. Empowering Expression and Protecting Safety We are always refining our policies and enforcement so that we’re both supporting people’s ability to express themselves and protecting safety across our platforms. We know we don’t always get it right, and we’re looking into ways we can improve our proactive enforcement, like through applying AI technology. We found that using warning screens to discourage hate speech or bullying and harassment content prevented some of this content — which could have violated our community standards — from being posted. We’re also expanding a test of Flagged by Facebook, which allows some group admins to better shape their group culture and take context into account by keeping some content in their groups that might otherwise be flagged for bullying and harassment. For example, through this test an admin for a group of fish tank enthusiasts allowed a flagged comment that called a fish “fatty,” which was not intended to be offensive. Fact-Checking and Helpful Comments We have built the largest global fact-checking network of any platform, with more than 90 fact-checking partners around the world who review and rate viral misinformation. In Q2, we displayed warnings on over 200 million distinct pieces of content on Facebook (including re-shares) globally based on over 130,000 debunking articles written by our fact-checking partners. In the US, we partner with 10 fact-checking organizations, five of which cover content in Spanish. We’re adding TelevisaUnivision as another US partner to cover Spanish language content. We’ve also launched a pilot program on Facebook that aims to show people more reliable information and empower them to decide what to read, trust and share. A small group of our US third-party fact-checking partners has the ability to comment in English and Spanish to provide more information on public Facebook posts that they determine could benefit from more context. This effort is separate from our third-party fact-checking program. The comments aren’t fact-check ratings. They won’t result in any enforcement penalties for content owners, nor will they impact a post’s distribution or the overall status of a Page. Also, unlike fact-checks, these comments will appear on Facebook posts that may not be verifiably false but that people may find misleading."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/08/sharing-a-passion-for-the-outdoors-and-design-on-facebook/","date":"2022-08-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Sharing a Passion for the Outdoors and Design on Facebook","text":"Tara P. grew up with a deep love for the outdoors and always wanted to create a special outdoor space at home.

Chetty and his team at Harvard’s Opportunity Insights are known for their groundbreaking research on economic opportunity in the United States and how public policy can improve a person’s economic mobility. They have long speculated that people’s social connections play a large role in shaping the opportunities people have to find jobs, succeed in school or find help during a crisis. But they didn’t have access to the data necessary to explore their hypothesis. Together, Opportunity Insights and Meta embarked on a years-long research project that has culminated in two papers published today in the journal Nature. It also led to the creation of the Social Capital Atlas, new datasets and research insights that uses data from Facebook friendships to provide measures of social capital across ZIP codes, high schools and colleges in the United States. Meta is making this dataset available through our Data for Good program. We’ve also partnered with Opportunity Insights to build tools to easily visualize and download the data at socialcapital.org. This work is a major contribution to our understanding of the relationship between social connections and economic opportunity. And it shows how Meta’s data can be used for societally significant research when shared responsibly and in a way that protects people’s privacy. Chetty’s Opportunity Insights group and researchers at Harvard, New York University and Stanford partnered with Meta researchers to analyze privacy-protected data from US Facebook and Instagram users. They used a range of techniques to preserve people’s privacy, including methods like differential privacy and aggregation. The researchers found that social connections play an important role in helping people achieve economic mobility. Neighborhoods that foster more connections between low-income and high-income people tend to have higher levels of mobility. The research also highlights why it is crucial that policymakers take social factors and interventions into account when designing policies, such as the need for mentorship programs in under-resourced schools to complement financial support. The Social Capital Atlas provides data to better understand where such efforts would be most valuable. We hope to contribute to similar research projects around the world. For instance, our teams are beginning to explore research into the role of social capital in communities in the UK and deepen our understanding into the role of social connections in society worldwide. Sharing timely and relevant insights is a long-standing practice at Meta. For example, this project developed through work done by Meta’s New Product Experimentation (NPE) team to explore how data can be used to solve city and community problems. And our Data for Good team works to build and share privacy-protected maps, surveys and data insights that support the work of over 550 partners in over 70 countries around the world.

Music Revenue Sharing is available to creators in markets where music is available on Facebook. Originally published on July 25, 2022 at 8:00AM PT: Today, we’re introducing Music Revenue Sharing on Facebook, making it easier for creators to monetize their videos that use licensed music from popular and emerging artists like Post Malone, Tove Lo, Grupo La Cumbia, Leah Kate, Bicep and more. This gives both creators and music rights holders a new way to earn money from videos on Facebook. Music Revenue Sharing is powered by Rights Manager, a video, audio and image-matching tool we developed to help content owners protect their rights and manage their content at scale. In addition, this feature is made possible through our partnerships across the music industry; it’s the first of its kind at this scale, benefiting creators, our partners, music rights holders and fans. How It Works Creators can now earn money through certain videos that use licensed songs with Music Revenue Sharing — something they weren’t able to do previously. Creators must be eligible for in-stream ads in their content and meet our monetization eligibility standards in order to access Music Revenue Sharing. Video creators will receive 20% revenue share on eligible videos, with a separate share going to music rights holders and to Meta. Content must satisfy Facebook’s monetization policies, Community Standards and music guidelines. The video must be at least 60 seconds long and there must be a visual component in the video as well; the licensed music itself cannot be its primary purpose. More details and criteria for revenue sharing can be found in the Help Center. Music Revenue Sharing will start rolling out today to video creators globally. Eligible videos will monetize with in-stream ads delivered in the US to start, and we’ll expand to the rest of the world where music is available on Facebook in the coming months. You can find videos from creators you follow and new ones you may not follow yet in Facebook Watch and in Feed.

We’re also naming the primary tab — the first thing you see when you open the app — Home. Home is the starting point for connection, entertainment and discovery on Facebook.

Feeds: Keeping Up on the Latest We understand you may want more options when it comes to sorting and seeing your content. There are times you might know just what you’re looking for — say, the latest posts from your groups — or you may want to encounter fresh, entertaining content. As Home becomes more of a discovery engine for you to find and follow new content and creators through recommendations, the Feeds tab provides an easy way to access the content from the people and communities you’re already connected with on Facebook. There are no Suggested For You posts in Feeds and ads are included. Starting today, some people will see Feeds as a tab in their shortcut bar; on iOS, this bar is found at the bottom of the app, and on Android, it’s found at the top. We expect these updates to be rolled out globally over the next week. The tabs in the shortcut bar change based on the parts of the app you’re using the most. You can also personalize and pin a tab in your shortcut bar, making its placement permanent. Home: Where Discovery Happens We’re introducing the name Home for the tab you see when you first open the Facebook app. This is where you will discover new content through recommendations in addition to connecting with your friends and family. From Home, you can also create a Reel, see what your connections are sharing on Feed and in Stories, and build community over new and shared interests. Your Home tab is uniquely personalized to you through our machine learning ranking system. This system takes into account thousands of signals to help cut through the clutter and rank content in the order we think you will find most valuable. We’re investing in AI to best serve recommended content in this ranked experience. While Home is where you’ll increasingly find community through your passions and interests, you can continue to stay up-to-date on the people and communities you care about most in Feeds."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/first-annual-human-rights-report/","date":"2022-07-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta","WhatsApp"],"title":"A Closer Look: Meta’s First Annual Human Rights Report","text":"As we committed to doing, today we are releasing Meta’s first annual Human Rights Report, covering 2020 and 2021, which details how we’re addressing potential human rights concerns stemming from our products, policies or business practices. This report builds on the work we’ve done since 2018 of disclosing human rights impact assessments, as well as on a commitment we made in the Meta Human Rights Policy to report annually on our insights and actions from our human rights work. We’ve sought to ground the report, and our human rights work, in the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Inside the Report This report provides more details about our entire approach to managing human rights risks. While some areas of the report have been previously disclosed, many are new, such as the due diligence we performed in regard to COVID-19 and Ray-Ban Stories. The report’s structure follows the pillars of the Human Rights Policy. It is our first take at an in-depth human rights disclosure report — something done by a small but growing number of companies. Similar to how we report on our sustainability work each year, this report will serve as a regular annual disclosure on how we are addressing our human rights impacts that people can expect to see on a regular basis. It includes details about how we’ve updated our policies as part of an ongoing effort to take human rights considerations into account in an increasingly dynamic world, including: specifically referencing human rights principles; clarifying our health misinformation policies; enhancing our bullying and harassment policy to create stronger protections against gender-based harassment for everyone, including public figures; prohibiting certain mass harassment or brigading; expanding our policies that prohibit veiled and implicit threats, and more. The report explains how our Data Policy, our Law Enforcement Response Team and our due diligence assessments work together to protect people from unlawful or overbroad government surveillance. It highlights the important role that end-to-end encryption plays on WhatsApp in protecting people’s privacy — particularly journalists and human rights defenders — and how we’re expanding it to our other messaging apps. We show how we manage risks related to human trafficking and exploitation through in-product features that raise awareness, deter violating behavior and offer support to victims. We also note how our Community Standards and Community Guidelines address hate speech, how our advertising policies address non-discrimination, and how our dedicated Civil Rights and Human Rights teams worked across the company during the reporting period to help ensure responsible innovation and accessibility. Finally, the report discusses our work to increase teen safety on Instagram, our continuing work to fight child exploitation on WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram and the significant investments we’ve made in teams and technologies to better protect free and fair elections, including dedicated teams focused on election integrity and products that bring people relevant and reliable voting information. Looking Ahead We hope this report is read in the spirit we wrote it: as a genuine effort to tell the story of our evolving human rights risk management, disclose actions and insights with humility, and develop a strong practice from which to do more. We’re also launching a website today, available in several languages, to share more information on our human rights work. As we continue to look to future technologies and the metaverse ahead, we’ll stay focused on building in ways that are inclusive and empowering for everyone."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/meta-accounts-and-horizon-profiles-for-vr/","date":"2022-07-06T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Meta Quest","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Meta Accounts and Meta Horizon Profiles for VR","text":"Update August 23, 2022 at 9:00AM PT: Meta accounts and Meta Horizon profiles are now live. Learn more about how to get started with Meta accounts. Originally posted on July 7, 2022 at 9:00AM PT: Today, Mark Zuckerberg introduced Meta accounts: a new way for people to log into their VR headsets that doesn’t require a Facebook account. Starting in August 2022, if you’re new to Meta VR devices or have previously merged your Oculus account with your Facebook account, you’ll need to create a Meta account and Meta Horizon profile. If you’ve been logging into your VR device with your Oculus account, you can continue to do so until January 1, 2023, at which point you’ll need to create a Meta account and Meta Horizon profile to continue using your Meta VR device. Your Meta account is not a social media profile; it lets you log into your VR devices and view and manage your purchased apps in one place. In the future, we’ll extend Meta account functionality so you can use it to log into other Meta devices. You can also add your Meta account to the same Accounts Center as your Facebook or Instagram account to unlock connected experiences across Meta technologies — like finding your Facebook friends to play games with in VR or chatting with friends on Messenger. And if you don’t want to use your Facebook or Instagram account in VR, you don’t have to. Meta Horizon Profile After you finish creating a Meta account, you’ll be prompted to create a Meta Horizon profile. Your Meta Horizon profile is your social profile in VR and other surfaces, like from a web browser. You can customize how you appear to others — as a gamer or as your buttoned-up 9-to-5 persona. You can choose your Meta Horizon profile username that’s unique to you (e.g. WarriorMama365), the profile name that will be displayed to others while you’re in VR (e.g. Monique Smith), your profile photo, avatar and more. You can create one Meta Horizon profile per Meta account. Your Oculus friends will become your followers, similar to how it works on Instagram. This update provides more ways to be social and connect with others. You can choose whether to share your active status and activity updates, like the apps you own and your achievements, with your followers. If you already own a Meta VR headset, your Oculus friends will automatically become your followers and you’ll follow them back by default. You can choose to unfollow anyone or remove followers at any time. Privacy Controls We want to let you control who you interact with in VR and build your own community. As part of this update, you’ll now find a menu with three privacy options to help guide you through which privacy settings are the best fit for you: Open to Everyone, Friends and Family, and Solo. After you make your selection, you’ll have the opportunity to review and confirm your individual privacy settings are set the way you want them. You can change these settings at any time. As part of these privacy settings, you have the option to set your Meta Horizon profile to private, which means you’ll be asked to review and approve follower requests. If you choose this option, only your followers can see who you follow and who follows you. Keep in mind that people who don’t follow you will still be able to view your profile picture, avatar, username, display name, follower count and the number of people you follow. People can also still search for your name or username and send you follow requests. People between the ages of 13 and 17 will have their Meta Horizon profiles set to private by default.

Octopus: Scraping For Hire The first action is against a company called Octopus, a US subsidiary of a Chinese national high-tech enterprise that claims to have over one million customers. Octopus offers scraping services and access to software that customers can use to scrape any website. For a fee, Octopus customers can launch scraping attacks from its cloud-based platform or hire Octopus to scrape websites directly. Octopus offers to scrape data from Amazon, eBay, Twitter, Yelp, Google, Target, Walmart, Indeed, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. After paying for access to the scraping software, customers self-compromised their Facebook and Instagram accounts by providing their authentication information to Octopus. Octopus designed the software to scrape data accessible to the user when logged into their accounts, including data about their Facebook Friends such as email address, phone number, gender and date of birth, as well as Instagram followers and engagement information such as name, user profile URL, location and number of likes and comments per post. Meta is an industry leader in taking legal action to protect people from scraping and exposing these types of services, which provide scraping as a service across multiple websites. Companies like Octopus are part of an emerging scraping industry that provides automation services to any customer — regardless of who they target and for what purpose they scrape. This industry makes scraping available to individuals and companies that otherwise would not have the capabilities. Our lawsuit alleges that Octopus has violated our Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, by engaging in unauthorized and automated scraping and attempting to conceal their scraping and avoid being detected and blocked from Facebook and Instagram. We are seeking a permanent injunction against Octopus. Protecting people against scraping for hire services, operating across many platforms and national boundaries, also requires a collective effort from platforms, policymakers and civil society and is needed to deter the abuse of these capabilities both among those who sell them and those who buy them. Mystalk: Targeting Clone Sites We have also filed an action against a Turkish-based individual, Defendant Ekrem Ateş, for using automated Instagram accounts to scrape data from the profiles of over 350,000 Instagram users. These profiles were viewable to logged-in Instagram users. The Defendant published the scraped data on his own websites or “clone sites.” A clone site is a website that copies and displays Instagram profiles, posts and other information without authorization. Our External Data Misuse team has provided an overview of how we work to safeguard people against clone sites. Since February 2021, we have taken a number of enforcement actions against this Defendant, including disabling accounts, sending a cease and desist letter, and revoking his access to Meta’s services."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/06/features-to-find-and-connect-with-facebook-groups/","date":"2022-06-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Introducing Features to Quickly Find and Connect with Facebook Groups","text":"New Ways to Organize Your Groups On Facebook, we’re testing a new sidebar that helps you easily find your favorite groups more quickly. It will list your groups and the latest activity within them, like new posts or chats you haven’t yet seen. You can also pin your favorite groups so they show up first, discover new groups or even create your own. For example, if you want quick access to the latest recipes in your cooking group, you can now pin it to the top, find related groups and be inspired to start your own. We’re improving how each group is organized, so you can jump right into what’s happening. Within your group, you’ll see a new menu that includes things like events, shops and a variety of channels to make it easier to connect with others around the topics you care about. So, once you’re in your cooking group, you’ll be able to stay up to date with the group’s upcoming events, buy their latest swag and seamlessly join conversations. Connect in Smaller Spaces Admins can begin to create channels to connect with their groups in smaller, more casual settings where they can have deeper discussions on common interests or organize their communities around topics in different formats: Community chat channels: a place for people to message, collaborate and form deeper relationships around topics in a more real-time way across both Facebook Groups and Messenger. So when you’re in your new BBQ lovers group and need real-time feedback while attempting your first brisket, an admin can create a chat for that. Community audio channels: a feature where admins and members can casually jump in and out of audio conversations in real time. If you’re looking to hear best practices from other grill masters in your BBQ lovers group, there could be an audio channel created that’s available within your Facebook Group and on Messenger. Community feed channels: a way for community members to connect when it’s most convenient for them. Admins can organize their communities around topics within the group for members to connect around more specific interests. For example, if you’re in a BBQ lovers group, there could be a feed channel where you can post and comment on the topic of smokers."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/06/introducing-meta-pay/","date":"2022-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Messenger","Meta","Product News","WhatsApp"],"title":"Introducing Meta Pay","text":"Update on September 28, 2022 at 6:00AM PT: Starting today, Facebook Pay is transitioning to Meta Pay in nearly 200 countries globally. Learn more about where this transition is happening and where Meta Pay will be available. Originally published on June 23, 2022 at 9:00AM PT: Our company rebrand last year reinforced our commitment and vision to help build the next evolution of social connection — the metaverse. As Mark Zuckerberg announced yesterday, we’re changing Facebook Pay to Meta Pay to bring our payments offering closer to our rebrand. Meta Pay will be the same easy, secure way for you to shop, send money and donate to causes you care about across our technologies, including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as anywhere you previously would’ve seen the Facebook Pay button while shopping online. Meta Pay’s features and overall user experience people know from Facebook Pay will remain the same. This change is first rolling out in the US and will roll out globally over time. Just like with Facebook Pay, with Meta Pay people will be able to: Add their preferred payment method once, then use Meta Pay where available to make payments and purchases across our technologies and while shopping elsewhere online. View payment history, manage payment methods and update their settings in one place. Get 24/7 customer care via email or chat where available. Security and Protection for Payments We’ve offered trusted payment services since 2009. Today, we enable people and businesses in over 160 countries to make payments in 55 currencies. We continue to invest in security. Just as with Facebook Pay, Meta Pay encrypts and securely stores your payment card numbers, performs anti-fraud monitoring on our systems to detect unauthorized activity and notifies you if that occurs. You can also create a Meta Pay PIN or use your device’s face or fingerprint recognition to secure every payment. How to Set up Meta Pay If you have previously set up Facebook Pay, then there’s no action required to start using Meta Pay. All of your existing Facebook Pay information will remain the same in Meta Pay, including account details, your payment method and settings. If you’re new to Meta Pay, it’s easy to set up: Go to Payments settings. Enter your payment method and account information. Meta Pay supports most major credit and debit cards, as well as PayPal and Shop Pay. Use Meta Pay the next time you make a purchase, donate, or send money across our technologies or anywhere you see the Meta Pay button when shopping online. (Please note that availability, use cases and set up may vary.) What’s Next Innovative products can help give people, businesses and creators more control over their finances. We see an incredible opportunity to develop financial products that connect people to the digital economy. Meta Pay plays an instrumental role in connecting people and businesses now and in the future. These connections will help drive growth across the metaverse ecosystem. It’s important to us that we’re making sending and receiving money as simple, fast and cheap as sending a message to anyone, anywhere. And that we’re offering trusted, convenient ways to pay for goods and services anywhere in the world.

We’re also extending our commitment to not take fees on Subscriptions, Badges, Paid Online Events and Bulletin by an additional year, running until January 1, 2024. Expanding Facebook Stars Facebook Stars — a digital good that fans can buy and send to support creators — is now open to all eligible creators on Facebook Live, on-demand videos and will soon be available on Facebook Reels. Now, any creator who meets the following eligibility criteria will be able to begin receiving Stars from their fans: At least 1,000 followers through the last 60 days In one of these markets: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States Compliance with Partner Monetization Policies and Content Monetization Policies In addition to Facebook Live and on-demand video, we’re expanding our Stars on Reels test and will invite hundreds of thousands of creators to use Stars on Reels in the coming months. We’ve also launched new mobile tools for creators to onboard to Stars, check their Stars earnings by content type, manage their goals and more. More Ways to Earn with Facebook Reels Last year, we announced our Facebook Reels Play bonus program, which gives creators the opportunity to earn money from Facebook by creating and sharing eligible public Reels. To date, this has only been available to select creators on an invite-only basis. Soon we’ll open an application process for US-based creators who meet this criteria: 5+ original Reels created in the last 30 days 100,000+ plays in the last 30 days Meet our Partner Monetization Policies and Content Monetization Policies We’re also testing ways creators can earn money on both Instagram and Facebook with crossposted Reels. Creators will soon be able to use the “Paid Partnerships with” label for branded content on Facebook Reels and allow sponsors to easily convert them to Branded Content Ads. Helping Brands and Creators Collaborate on Branded Content We will soon begin testing Creator Marketplace on Instagram, where brands and creators can more easily build branded content partnerships. Creators will be able to indicate the brands and topics they’re interested in making branded content for, discover opportunities to partner with vetted brands and manage their brand deals without ever leaving the app. We’ll also begin testing in-app payments, so brands can pay creators for branded content directly through Instagram when a project is complete. Brands will also be able to discover and collaborate with Instagram creators through Meta Business Suite using demographic and interest filters for both a creator and their audience. When they’ve found a creator they want to partner with, they’ll be able to send a project that outlines the details of the opportunity, including deliverables and payment offered. Building Relationships with Fans Across Platforms We know that many creators have built a fanbase across a variety of online platforms. With that in mind, we’re announcing our first investment in interoperable monetization tools for creators: Interoperable Subscriber Groups. This enables creators to receive payments from their fans on other platforms, and automatically add them to their subscribers-only Facebook Groups. This will save creators’ valuable time by not having to manually admit individual members into their Facebook Groups and help them retain their most loyal fans. We’re launching an initial test this month with select partners, with plans to expand to more in the coming months. Digital Collectibles Available to More Creators, in More Places As we build for the metaverse, investing in web3 technologies and digital collectibles like NFTs is a crucial part of our long-term commitment to creators. We’re already seeing creators like @misshattan, @nylacollection_nft, @amber_vittoria and @bossbeautiesnft find success sharing their NFTs with their communities on Instagram. We’re expanding our test of digital collectibles on Instagram to more creators and a handful of additional countries. Creators and collectors will be able to share their digital collectibles across Facebook and Instagram after we begin rolling out the feature on Facebook with select US creators at a later date. We’ll also soon start to test NFTs in Instagram Stories with SparkAR. We’ve also compiled a guide on how NFTs work and why they’re essential for the metaverse. There will be no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram, and for now we won’t offer the ability to turn digital collectible posts into ads. We know that NFTs raise important sustainability questions. As part of Meta’s commitment to sustainability, we’re helping to reduce the emissions impact that might be associated with digital collectibles by purchasing renewable energy.

Mark Zuckerberg joined Eva Chen, VP Fashion Partnerships on IG Live to discuss our vision for avatars and the metaverse, as well as the opportunity this unlocks for brands and businesses. Watch the full conversation. Be Uniquely You Your avatar is a digital expression of your personality (or personalities). It can convey how much of an extrovert or introvert you are, your sense of humor and even your fashion sense. It lets you be your authentic self, and that in turn can help you connect more meaningfully with your friends, family, coworkers, or anyone else you meet on the road to the metaverse. We want to enable everyone to present the best version of themselves, which is why we’ve made it possible to customize your avatar with a wide variety of free outfits and accessories.

In fact, with more than a quintillion combinations of free avatar options already available, your choices will almost certainly be uniquely yours. We also know that people often want to change their look, whether in the real world or in digital spaces.

For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, food reflects not only the diversity and rich history of the AAPI community, but also the act of love that brings friends and families together. Through online communities like Subtle Asian Traits, younger generations throughout the Asian diaspora are coming together to celebrate their heritage, while also using these spaces to explore the duality of their Asian and American identities. Founded in 2018, Subtle Asian Traits now has over 2 million members, inspiring people to create their own “subtle” communities focused on different facets of Asian culture, shared experiences and interests, including Subtle Asian Baking, Subtle Curry Traits and Subtle Asian Cooking. “Love Through Food” features a number of cherished family recipes, while also sharing nostalgic memories from members of these Facebook groups. Yuzu Castella Strawberry Shortcake Fred Chang, Subtle Asian Baking Castella is a light cake first introduced to Japan by Portuguese missionaries centuries ago. It has since become a staple of wagashi (a traditional Japanese confectionery) and led to more varieties in other Asian countries, including Taiwan — birthplace of Subtle Asian Baking member Fred Chang. Raised in Southern California, Fred often reminisces about the castella cakes his mom would get from the local Taiwanese bakery for his after-school snack. So, the former MasterChef contestant created his own take on the treat as a dedication to her. Fred combined his childhood memories with Japanese baking techniques and flavors he learned while spending some time there, for a unique castella.

Several reports covering the second half of 2021 on topics ranging from government requests for user data, how we’re protecting people’s intellectual property, how often our services were disrupted, when we had to restrict content based on local laws in a particular country And a new Transparency Center reports page that makes country-specific regulatory reports more accessible We’re also releasing the findings from EY’s independent assessment of our enforcement reporting. Last year, we asked EY to verify the metrics of our Community Standards Enforcement Report since we don’t believe we should grade our own homework. EY’s assessment concluded that the calculation of the metrics have been prepared based on the specified criteria and the metrics are fairly stated, in all material respects. As we keep growing this report, we will also keep working on ways to make sure that it’s accurately presented and independently verified. Highlights From the Report The prevalence of violating content on Facebook and Instagram remained relatively consistent but decreased in some of our policy areas from Q4 2021 to Q1 2022. On Facebook in Q1 we took action on: 1.8 billion pieces of spam content, which was an increase from 1.2 billion in Q4 2021, due actions on a small number of users making a large volume of violating posts 21.7 million pieces of violence and incitement content, which was an increase from 12.4 million in Q4 2021, due to the improvement and expansion of our proactive detection technology. On Instagram in Q1 we took action on: 1.8 million pieces of drug content, which was an increase from 1.2 million from Q4 2021, due to updates made to our proactive detection technologies. We also saw an increase in the proactive detection rate of bullying and harassment content from 58.8% in Q4 2021 to 67% in Q1 2022 thanks to improvement and expansion of our proactive detection technology. We also continued to see a slight decrease in prevalence on Facebook from 0.11-0.12% in Q4 2021 to 0.09% in Q1 2022. Refining Our Policies and Enforcement Over the years we’ve invested in building technology to improve how we can detect violating content. With this progress we’ve known that we’ll make mistakes, so it’s been equally important along the way to also invest in refining our policies, our enforcement and the tools we give to users. For example, we’ve improved our transparency over the years to better inform people why we took down a post and we’ve improved the ability to appeal and ask us to take another look. We include metrics about appeals in this report. Recently we’ve begun to evaluate the effectiveness of our penalty system more deeply, for example testing the impact of giving people additional warnings before triggering more severe penalties for violating our policies. Last year we saw how policy refinements can ensure that we aren’t over enforcing beyond what we intend. Updates we made to our bullying and harassment policy better accounted for language that can be easily misunderstood without context. Enforcement systems also play a role: we recently began testing new AI technology that identifies and prevents potential over-enforcement by better learning from content that’s appealed and subsequently restored. For example, the same word that is an offensive slur in the U.S. is also a common British term for cigarette which would not violate our policies. We’re also testing a number of improvements to our proactive enforcement, to enable some admins of Groups to better shape group culture and take context into account around what is and isn’t allowed in their space; or to better reflect the context in which people write comments between friends, where sometimes good-natured banter could be mistaken as violating content. Looking Ahead For a long time, our work has focused on measuring and reducing the prevalence of violating content on our services. But we’ve worked just as hard to improve the accuracy of our enforcement decisions. While prevalence helps us measure what we miss, we’ve also been working on developing robust measurements around mistakes, which will help us better understand where we act on content incorrectly. We believe sharing metrics around both prevalence and mistakes will provide a more complete picture of our overall enforcement system and help us improve, so we are committed to providing this in the future. Finally, as new regulations continue to roll out around the globe, we are focused on the obligations they create for us. So we are adding and refining processes and oversight across many areas of our work. This will enable us to make continued progress on social issues while also meeting our regulatory obligations more effectively."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/05/facebook-widely-viewed-content-report-q1-2022/","date":"2022-05-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Widely Viewed Content Report, First Quarter 2022","text":"Today, we’re publishing the Widely Viewed Content Report (WVCR) for the first quarter of 2022. This report highlights the most-viewed organic content in Feed in the US, including domains, links, Pages and posts. It includes content recommended by Facebook and excludes advertising content. See the full report and Companion Guide for more information. Updates and Enforcements Based on feedback from several academic and civil society organizations, we are improving our link and domain data methodologies. Previously, we counted a link view as any time a post or video containing a link was viewed, even if the link was not front and center. However, the feedback from these organizations was that our data would be more meaningful if we only counted link or domain views that rendered a preview. Moving forward, links will need to render a preview in order to be counted as a view, as that more accurately represents what people are seeing. As part of the transition, the Q1 2022 report includes top viewed links using both our old and new methodologies. Starting next quarter, the WVCR will use only the new methodology. In this report, there were pieces of content that have since been removed from Facebook for violating our policies of Inauthentic Behavior. The removed links were all from the same domain, and links to that domain are no longer allowed on Facebook. During the last reporting cycle, we took seriously the feedback criticizing our approach to disclosing additional details about the content removed from Facebook that appears in this report. We have updated our removal disclosure framework in the report and Companion Guide. We will aim to disclose as much information as possible about removed content, including Inauthentic Behavior, that appears in the report moving forward. However, in instances where disclosing specific details on removed content would cause harm to our community, we will err on the side of keeping the community safe. Some lower-quality posts ended up amongst our most viewed last quarter, although it is important to note that the top 20 links in this report represent only 0.03% of all Feed content views in the US during the quarter. The fourth URL in the report linked to a YouTube video of a panel discussion held by a U.S. Senator that was rated False by one of our fact-checking partners. When that happened, we took a number of steps to limit the reach of this link, including adding a warning screen that shared more information about the claim, showing a notification warning to someone when they try to share the link and reducing the distribution of the link in Feed. Our strategy mirrors the recommendations of experts and academics in this field: deeper investments in outreach by trusted organizations online, as well as fact-checking as a primary approach to misinformation, since removing certain false claims about COVID-19 can exacerbate feelings of distrust with authorities and further marginalize populations. And without these features, this link would likely have reached more people, and those who viewed it would not have seen additional information and context from the false fact check. Insights from the WVCR help inform how we update our existing policies and products, and develop new ones, to address harmful or otherwise objectionable content. For example, we’ve been testing new ways to reduce clickbait, engagement bait and spam. While we’re seeing improvements from these tests, we will need to continually evaluate and refine our approach before seeing consistent results. We’ll continue to test alternative solutions to reduce engagement bait, misinformation and content from Pages that repeatedly violate our Community Standards."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/04/supporting-muslim-mothers/","date":"2022-04-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Supporting Muslim Mothers","text":"Video Playerhttps://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mp4captions-FilmOpen_MuslimMamas_4x5.mp4Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not foundDownload File: https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mp4captions-FilmOpen_MuslimMamas_4x5.mp4?_=100:0000:0000:00Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.

We’re introducing a number of features to help reduce admin workload and help admins efficiently manage their groups while also growing them with the relevant audiences. Today, we’re announcing new features to help Facebook group admins keep their groups safe and healthy, reduce misinformation, and to make it easier for them to manage and grow their groups with relevant audiences. Keeping Groups Safe and Reducing Misinformation Communities can only thrive as places to connect when they are safe. These new tools will help admins prevent the spread of misinformation and manage interactions in their group: Adding the ability through Admin Assist to automatically decline incoming posts that have been identified as containing false information. Incoming posts that contain content rated by third-party fact-checkers as false are declined before they are seen in the group, which helps reduce the visibility of misinformation. Expanding the functionality of “mute” and updating it to “suspend,” so admins and moderators can temporarily suspend group members and participants from posting, commenting, reacting, participating in a group chat, and creating or entering a Room in a group. More Easily Manage a Community To help make it easier for group admins to manage their communities, with these updates they can: Use Admin Assist to automatically approve or decline member requests, based on specific criteria they set up, including whether the prospective member has completed all member questions. More efficiently manage their group with new updates to Admin Home. This includes an overview page on desktop to quickly review things that need attention, a layout update to more easily sort and search tasks, and an insights summary on mobile to help admins understand the growth and engagement of their groups. Grow Groups with the Relevant Audiences These new tools will help admins who want to grow their communities by reaching the relevant people: To help make sharing groups and connecting with a specific community a more seamless experience, we’ve added QR codes which admins can download or copy and paste from the Share menu and share as they like. When scanned, people will be directed to the group’s About page where you can join or request to join. We’ve also added the option for admins to send invites via email to invite people to join their groups.

In this report, content and Pages were removed for violating our policies involving personal information bait, inauthentic behavior, phishing and harassment. We generally don’t publicly share additional identifying information about Pages or profiles that have been removed. As we look for ways to be more transparent about our most widely viewed content, we are exploring how best to provide more details going forward. (Updated on March 1, 2022 at 7:45PM PT to clarify our approach to identifying pages we’ve previously removed.) We’ve also seen promising results from our tests to reduce engagement bait — spammy posts that explicitly request reactions for purposes other than a specific call to action. These efforts included expanding our identifiers and introducing spacing rules to help prevent multiple posts that are identified as engagement bait from showing up one after the other in Feed. Our approach will continue to evolve over time. Expansion Plans By releasing the WVCR, we have the opportunity to shed new light on the content that is widely seen in Feed. We’ll continue to expand the scope of this report in the coming months. Our goal is to keep working with external stakeholders to improve and refine these reports and we will share more information as this develops."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/launching-facebook-reels-globally/","date":"2022-02-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Launching Facebook Reels Globally and New Ways for Creators to Make Money","text":"We’re launching Facebook Reels in more than 150 countries for creators around the world to grow their communities. To help creators earn money from Facebook Reels, we’re expanding tests of overlay ads, starting with banner and sticker ads. New Facebook Reels features include Remix, sharing to Facebook Stories and more. Today, we’re expanding the availability of Facebook Reels for iOS and Android to more than 150 countries across the globe. We’re also introducing better ways to help creators to earn money, new creation tools and more places to watch and create Facebook Reels. Our Fastest Growing Content Format Watching video is half of time spent on Facebook and Instagram, and Reels is our fastest growing content format by far. We’re focused on making Reels the best way for creators to get discovered, connect with their audience and earn money. We also want to make it fun and easy for people to find and share relevant and entertaining content. Since launching in the US, we’ve seen creators like Kurt Tocci (and his cat, Zeus) share original comedic skits, author and Bulletin writer Andrea Gibson offer a reading of their published poetry, Nigerian-American couple Ling and Lamb try new foods and dancer and creator Niana Guerrero do trending dances, like the #ZooChallenge. More Ways to Earn Money from Facebook Reels We’re creating a variety of opportunities for creators to earn money for their reels. Our Reels Play bonus program, part of our $1 billion creator investment, pays eligible creators up to $35,000 a month based on the views of their qualifying reels. These bonuses have helped creators like Jason the Great fund their reels creation and better understand what types of content works on Facebook. In the coming months, we’ll expand the bonus program to more countries, so more creators can get rewarded for creating reels that their communities love. Building on our deep experience in helping creators earn meaningful income from our monetization products like in-stream ads and Stars, we’re also building direct monetization options for Facebook Reels through ad revenue share and fan support. We’re expanding tests of Facebook Reels Overlay Ads to all creators in the US, Canada and Mexico, and to more countries in the coming weeks. We’re starting with two formats: banner ads that appear as a semi-transparent overlay at the bottom of a Facebook Reel, and sticker ads: a static image ad that can be placed by a creator anywhere within their reel. These non-interruptive ads enable creators to earn a portion of the ad revenue. Any creator in the US, Canada and Mexico who is part of our in-stream ads program is automatically eligible to monetize their publicly-shared reels with ads. By mid-March, these tests will expand to creators in nearly all countries where in-stream ads are available. Creators can learn more about overlay ads on our Meta for Creators blog. We’ll also begin testing Stars on Facebook Reels in the coming weeks, so that people can buy and send Stars while watching reels to support creators. Both overlay ads and Stars are designed so that as more people view and engage with Reels on Facebook, creator payouts can grow. We’re also launching brand suitability controls, including Publisher Lists, Blocklists, Inventory Filters and Delivery Reports for Banner and Sticker Ads in Facebook Reels in every region they are available, giving advertisers more control over how their ads appear in places they don’t consider suitable for their brand or campaign. Additionally, we’ve been testing full-screen and immersive ads in between Facebook Reels since October of last year, and will roll them out to more places around the world over the coming months. Just like with organic content on Facebook, people can comment, like, view, save, share and skip them. More Editing Features In addition to the features we announced last year, creators around the world will be able to access: Remix: Create your own reel alongside an existing, publicly-shared reel on Facebook. When you create a Remix, you can create a reel that includes all or part of another creator’s reel. 60-second Reels: Make reels up to 60 seconds long. Drafts: You will soon be able to create a reel and choose to “Save As Draft” below the Save button. Video Clipping: In the coming months, we’re planning to roll out video clipping tools that will make it easier for creators who publish live or long-form, recorded videos to test different formats. Create and Discover Reels in New Places Over the coming weeks, we’ll roll out the following updates to make it easier to create and discover reels in new places: Reels in Stories: You can share public reels to Stories on Facebook, making it easy to share favorite reels with friends and giving creators more visibility and reach. You’ll also be able to create reels from existing public stories. Reels in Watch: You’ll be able to watch reels directly within the Watch tab and we’re developing tools to help you create reels in the Watch tab as well. Top of Feed: We’re adding a new Reels label at the top of Feed so you’ll be able to easily create and watch reels in just a few clicks. Suggested Reels in Feed: In select countries, we’re starting to suggest reels that you may like in your Feed from people you do not already follow. We’re also exploring ways to make it easier for creators to share Reels to both their Facebook and Instagram audiences, such as crossposting. You can find Facebook Reels in Feed, Groups and Watch. When viewing a reel, you can follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it or share it with friends."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/facebook-counterspeech-in-pakistan-uk/","date":"2022-02-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Expanding Counterspeech Initiatives Into Pakistan and the UK","text":"When someone in Pakistan or the UK searches on Facebook for content related to organized hate or violent extremism, they will now be redirected to resources and support. Counterspeech is just one part of our strategy to tackle violent extremism, terrorism and organized hate. As part of our ongoing efforts to fight violent extremism and organized hate, we’re announcing the expansion of one of our flagship counterspeech initiatives, The Redirect Initiative, into Pakistan and the UK. Now when someone in Pakistan or the UK searches on Facebook using words associated with organized hate or violent extremism, the top search result will be a link to resources and support for how to leave violence and extremism behind. We’re partnering with Shaoor Foundation in Pakistan and Exit UK in the UK. Research shows that challenging violent, extremist views with positive counterspeech is one of the most effective ways to combat hate and extremism. Counterspeech involves responding to hateful, extremist narratives with empathy and alternative perspectives, rather than shutting these conversations down. Counterspeech is only effective if it comes from credible voices, so we’ve partnered with various NGOs and community groups on multiple counterspeech initiatives around the world including community programs, toolkits and research. “At Shaoor Foundation, we have worked for many years designing and implementing peace development programs in Pakistan. Building a society that is inclusive, respectful and peaceful and involves engaging the entire community, enabling people to speak up and providing a safe, accessible space to get support. We are pleased to partner with Meta on the Redirect Initiatve to help us scale our efforts and reach more people in need in Pakistan.” – Syed Ali Hameed, Executive Director at Shaoor Foundation The Redirect Initiative is already available in Australia, USA, Germany and Indonesia. A study by Moonshot CVE, an organization that works to counter extremism, found that the Redirect Initiative is successful at disrupting the connection between followers and the violent, extreme content they seek. “Working in partnership with technology companies like Meta will help ensure the safety and well-being of the public and those that might be vulnerable online. At Exit UK, we help people involved in the far-right leave, and we also support wider members of the community, many of whom feel they have no-one to talk to. We understand the importance of offering non-judgemental advice and support so that over time we can help people improve their critical thinking skills and develop positive counter narratives to challenge hate online.” – Nigel Bromage, Founder of Exit UK Counterspeech is just one part of our multi-faceted strategy to tackle violent extremism, terrorism and organized hate. Our policies clearly state that dangerous individuals and organizations themselves have no place on our platforms. We’ve banned thousands of individuals and organizations across the ideological spectrum under our rules, and we prohibit praise and support of these groups and their leaders on our platforms. We have a team of more than 350 dedicated specialists and sophisticated proactive detection technology to help us find and remove this content quickly. We’ll continue to work with diverse partners around the world to address extremism across society."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/healing-and-rebuilding-with-fellow-veterans/","date":"2021-12-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook"],"title":"Healing and Rebuilding With Fellow Veterans","text":"Like so many veterans, Jessica G. struggled with reintegration to “normal life” after serving in the Air Force.

The community hosts events, training and outreach to positively impact the lives of its 80,000 members, also known as “TONers.” At the peak of the pandemic, the community rallied together to provide a helpline for vulnerable members of the community to receive assistance. Jaidee Sadler. Black Owned Economy, UK Jaidee created Black Owned Economy to give Black-owned businesses and entrepreneurs a platform to promote their products and services, with hopes to drive economic equality for Black-owned businesses and make a lasting change in society. Today, she has made that a reality with over 150,000 members in Black Owned Economy, including thousands of Black-owned businesses that have benefitted from exposure and opportunities, which they would have otherwise lacked elsewhere. Throughout the pandemic, the community has come together to help business owners connect with new customers and secure brand partnerships. Mustafa Sharara.

We continually evaluate the effectiveness of News Feed ranking signals and give people insight into how content appears in their feeds. In 2021, we made significant progress in providing greater transparency into how the News Feed ranking process works, what gets distributed and why. We released new features to incorporate direct feedback we get from people who use Facebook by giving them more control over their feeds and reducing negative experiences. Here are some of the biggest changes and tests we launched this year: February: new tests to reduce political content in News Feed in response to direct feedback. March: the launch of Choose Who Can Comment, Favorites, the Feed Filter Bar, and an expansion of Why Am I Seeing This to suggested posts to provide people more context and control over the content they see and share in News Feed April: new tests to incorporate more direct feedback from people who use Facebook about the content they want to see more or less in their News Feed May: new options for where and how people can choose to see reaction counts on Facebook and Instagram August: our first-ever Widely Viewed Content Report to share what content is seen by the most people in News Feed in the US September: our Content Distribution Guidelines that list content and behaviors that receive reduced distribution in News Feed because they are problematic or otherwise low quality November: our second Widely Viewed Content Report and new ways to make News Feed controls easier to find and use for people and advertisers We continually evaluate the effectiveness of News Feed ranking signals and update or remove them when it makes sense. This month, we removed the transparent authorship signal because it did not have a significant effect on the news ecosystem. We still prioritize original reporting in News Feed and will continue to boost quality news by improving more impactful News Feed signals. News Feed uses personalized ranking, which takes into account thousands of unique signals to understand what’s most meaningful to you. Our aim isn’t to keep you scrolling on Facebook for hours on end, but to give you an enjoyable experience that you want to return to. It’s not in our interest to show you hateful or inflammatory content — our advertisers don’t want their ads shown next to it and our users tell us they don’t want it. We’re incentivized to reduce it. The prevalence of hate speech is now just about 0.03% of content viewed, or about 3 views per every 10,000 and continuing to drop. In the US, nearly 90% of the content people see is from friends, pages and groups they follow or are connected to because we use algorithmic ranking. We understand concerns people have about the lack of transparency over how algorithmic ranking systems work, so we’ve introduced new measures to give people more control over, and insight into, how content appears in their News Feed. Heading into the new year, we’ll continue to share updates on our tests and features that aim to give you more control and connect you to meaningful content."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/community-leader-spotlight/","date":"2021-12-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"21 Community Leaders Who Inspired Us in 2021","text":""},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/eliminating-stigma-through-storytelling/","date":"2021-12-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Eliminating Mental Health Stigma Through Storytelling","text":"<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span> For Matt, returning from serving in the Air Force in Iraq was a difficult readjustment.

New Professional Mode for Creator Profiles We want creators to reach their full potential on Facebook and that means giving them ways to earn money and gain insights that help them understand what types of posts resonate with fans and communities. Until now, these tools were only available on Pages. We know that many creators — especially those who are just starting out — are on profiles, so from today we’re announcing the roll-out of a new professional mode for profiles. Professional mode will open up access to post, audience and profile insights, as well as give easy access to monetization features – all in one place. For example, creators will be able to see the total number of shares, reactions and comments that posts have, and allow them to review their follower growth over time. Within the new tool, creators will remain in control of who sees what content they share; what will differ is that anyone will be able to follow them and see their public content in feed. This new mode is being tested with a limited number of profiles in the US, and will begin rolling out in EMEA next year. New Ways to Earn Money With Stars Since the roll-out of Stars last year, we’ve witnessed the amazing ways people have deepened their connection and supported creators they love. Available in 20 countries across EMEA, fans have purchased and sent Stars to their favourite Creators, such as UK based LadBaby and Dutch DJ and record producer, Armin Van Buuren. We want Stars to become the best way for people to show their appreciation on Facebook, so this week we announced new changes that will make buying and sending stars even easier. Up until now, Stars could only be purchased while watching videos – but we want Stars to exist everywhere that creators are engaging with their communities on Facebook. To do this, starting today we’re testing Stars in more places, including videos on News Feed, the Watch feed and the gaming tab. To make purchasing of Stars easier, we’re also launching Stars store, a new place for people to buy Stars via Facebook Pay and at lower rates, on mobile and desktop. When people purchase Stars through the Stars store, they will be deposited into their virtual wallet. They can then give them to eligible creators while watching their Facebook Live or on demand videos. Alongside these updates, we’re going to be introducing even more features that not only help Creators earn money, but equally give fans new opportunities to interact and feel closer to their favourite performers, influencers, gamers and more. This includes new bonus programmes for creators, as well as fan features including Stars Party and Stars badges. You can read more about these updates here. Facebook Reels Launching in EMEA in 2022 In September this year, we launched Reels on Facebook for iOS and Android in the US, creating a new space for short form, entertaining video experiences. Today, we’re announcing that this new feature will roll out in EMEA in the first half of 2022 – providing a new space for creators to creatively express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences. Just like Reels on Instagram, the feature on Facebook will consist of music, audio, video effects and much more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a Reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends who have access to their content. When shared publicly, Reels can reach everyone, not just existing followers, making it possible for the most creative, funny and inspiring creators to build an audience. In Groups, creators and group members can create and share reels to express themselves and engage in a more fun and visual way with their favourite interest communities. As we continue to build new products and invest in creators around the world, we’re excited to see how creators in EMEA continue to use these tools to share their passions, build a global community, and make money doing what they love."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/support-creators-with-stars-fest-on-facebook/","date":"2021-12-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Support Creators With Stars Fest on Facebook","text":"Starting today and throughout December, we’re celebrating Stars Fest on Facebook by featuring limited-time sales, virtual gifts and badges, exclusive creator livestreams and a Stars Creator Day. We’re launching a Stars store for people to easily purchase Stars at lower prices and introducing other new features for fans to send Stars together and get recognized as a top sender. We’re also offering a Stars bonus to double creators’ earnings and giving away $3 million in free Stars to fans. Today, we’re kicking off Stars Fest on Facebook — a month-long celebration to spotlight creators and recognize the amazing ways people have supported them with Stars. We’re offering bonuses to double creators’ earnings, limited-time sales on Stars, creator competitions and exclusive live streaming events. We’re also introducing new Stars features to help people show support for creators they love in new ways. Expanding Stars to More Places Our vision is for Stars to be the best way for people to show appreciation for creators on Facebook. To offer creators more ways to earn Stars, we’re testing them in videos on News Feed, the Watch feed and the gaming tab. And next year, we’ll test Stars in Reels. Introducing Stars Store We’re also launching Stars store, a website where people can easily purchase Stars using Facebook Pay. Stars are deposited into people’s virtual wallets to then send to eligible creators during Facebook Live, on-demand videos or Live Audio Rooms. In the Stars store, fans get more Stars for their money at lower prices, so they can support even more of their favorite creators. New Interactive Features and Top Sender Recognition We’re also introducing Stars Party, a fun way for people to send Stars together. When a certain number of people send Stars during a livestream, a countdown timer will appear and the community has five minutes to hit a Stars goal together. If the goal is met, the screen is taken over by a shooting Star animation and a giant “Thank You” message. From December 22-January 3, creators will receive a bonus of $50 for every completed Stars Party. Our new feature Stars badges appear next to a top Stars sender’s name for each creator when they comment on a live stream. The Stars badge will also show their tier, depending on how many Stars that person has sent to the creator over the past week. Additionally, we’re launching a Stars leaderboard on Facebook Live that displays the weekly top Stars senders for each creator. We’ll also roll out more leaderboard categories in the future, like top monthly senders and top all time Stars senders. Earn More With Bonuses and Free Stars As part of our $1 billion investment in creators, we’re launching the Stars Double bonus. Through March 31, Meta will match certain creators’ Stars earnings, up to $750 a month. All in, creators could earn up to $3,750 in bonus payments. The program is invite-only and available in all markets where Stars is available. Over the next few months, we’ll also give $3 million in free Stars to fans. People offered free Stars will receive an invitation to claim them while watching a creator’s live video. They can then send them immediately to their favorite creator or add a comment to accompany the gift. Stars Fest Now Until December 31 Stars Fest is taking place from now until December 31, featuring limited-time sales, special bonuses and exclusive events. From December 13-19, we’re featuring a diverse lineup of creator livestreams, including Roccibella, Candylover89, John Nonny. And on December 10, we’re hosting Stars Creator Day to collaborate with creators and help them learn more about Stars. To encourage new and longtime fans to send Stars during Stars Fest, Stars are on sale from December 6-26. Fans can also purchase limited-time virtual gifts, and if they send more than 500 Stars during Stars Fest, a special badge will appear next to the sender’s name. We’re excited to help creators like you earn a living doing what you love with products like Stars.

In this new interactive game, people can play solo or multiplayer to complete mazes and create their own mazes and challenges. We’re also announcing new products that blend playing, watching, and connecting on Facebook Gaming: Play with Streamer brings creators and their communities together in a game and Facebook Interactives turn watching gaming livestreams into an interactive experience. For more than 40 years, PAC-MAN™ has been a cultural icon in games, television, music and film. And today, we’re sharing the next step in this evolution by launching PAC-MAN COMMUNITY, exclusively on Facebook Gaming. This isn’t your parents’ PAC-MAN, but you can still access the entire classic PAC-MAN in the game. Developed by Genvid and in partnership with BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment, PAC-MAN COMMUNITY connects players, gaming video creators, viewers and world builders together in new ways. Play solo or through co-op multiplayer in groups of up to four people, working together to complete each maze while still competing against each other for the highest point total. In addition to PAC-MAN COMMUNITY’s built-in mazes, players can also create their own levels and challenges through the Maze Creator tool. Play Watch Connect With Play Watch Connect, we’re delivering more immersive and engaging social experiences that build community around games on Facebook. We’re bridging three pillars together — playing games, watching gaming video and connecting with others around games — to create richer experiences between people using our technologies, including in PAC-MAN COMMUNITY. Through our new Play with Streamer feature, Facebook Gaming creators can invite their communities directly from their livestream to join them in-game to play or watch. Player-created mazes will be featured inside the game daily, and soon we’ll launch community-oriented challenges and mazes curated and cultivated by streamers’ communities. We’re also making live gaming video an active experience with the introduction of Facebook Interactives, which allows you to participate while simultaneously watching a gamer’s livestream. In PAC-MAN COMMUNITY, people viewing a 24/7 livestream in Watch mode can also power up either the AI PAC-MAN or Ghosts and compete. Mazes are turned into 3D streams, powered by Unreal Engine, where viewers can interact directly with the video player. Coming later in the beta, by interacting with a streamer’s session, viewers can work collectively toward global unlocks for the Maze Creator tool. When a streamer isn’t live, the Watch tab will feature AI characters, just like an arcade machine that isn’t being played. We believe games bring people together in powerful ways, whether that’s playing games together, watching gaming videos, or connecting around games in Facebook Groups.

This is a required program for people who are at the highest risk of being targeted, so we’re sending emails and Facebook notifications to help make sure they’re aware of the requirement. People who receive the notification will have 14 days to enroll or they’ll be asked to enroll upon login if they miss the deadline. No action is required unless you receive this prompt. Learn more about the details on the program and how to enroll. Originally published on December 6, 2021 at 6:00AM PT: As part of our ongoing improvements to security, we’re expanding Facebook Protect, a program designed for people that are likely to be highly targeted by malicious hackers, including human rights defenders, journalists, and government officials. These people are at the center of critical communities for public debate. They enable democratic elections, hold governments and organizations accountable, and defend human rights around the world. Unfortunately this also means that they are highly targeted by bad actors. Facebook Protect helps these groups of people adopt stronger account security protections, like two-factor authentication, and monitors for potential hacking threats. We first tested Facebook Protect in 2018 and expanded it ahead of the 2020 US election. We began our global expansion in September of this year. Since then, more than 1.5 million accounts have enabled Facebook Protect, and of those, nearly 950K accounts newly enrolled in two-factor authentication. We are on track to expand the program to more than 50 countries by the end of the year, including the United States, India, and Portugal. No action is required unless you get a notification on Facebook that you’re eligible to enroll. Mandating Protections For Most Targeted People Two-factor authentication — particularly by using third-party authentication apps — significantly improves the security of your online accounts. Right now, anyone can enroll in two-factor authentication and everyone should. However, this important feature has been historically underutilized across the internet — even by people that are more likely to be targeted by malicious hackers, such as journalists, activists, political candidates and others. With Facebook Protect, we worked to make enrollment and use of two-factor authentication as frictionless as possible for these groups of people by providing better user experience and support. We’re also starting to require that they use it. We know that there will always be a small subset of users that won’t immediately enroll, for example those that happen to be less active on our platform at the time of a given mandate. However, we believe this is an important step forward for these highly targeted communities. What we’ve seen so far is encouraging: in early testing, simplifying our enrollments flows, improving customer support, and mandating Facebook Protect brought adoption rates to over 90 percent in one month for these groups. Over the next several months, we’re going to carefully expand this requirement globally. We’re encouraged by our early findings and will continue to improve Facebook Protect over time."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/ways-to-give-back-holiday-season/","date":"2021-11-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"More Ways to Give Back This Holiday Season","text":"To celebrate GivingTuesday, we’re matching up to $8 million in donations made to eligible fundraisers on Facebook, and we’re expanding access to fundraising on Instagram so more than 1.5 million organizations can bolster their causes.

We’re testing a new feature for people to offer free items on Facebook Neighborhoods. Update on November 30, 2021 at 4:00AM PT: Today, you can check out special GivingTuesday episodes from Facebook Watch original talk shows “Peace of Mind with Taraji” with Taraji P.

Originally published on November 15, 2021 at 7:00AM PT: Every day, people all over the world use our apps to share the ups and downs of life, build communities around shared interests and common causes, and start and grow businesses. One of the most rewarding things we see is the great compassion and generosity so many people show – whether it’s using our tools to help out in their communities, give blood, support local businesses or raise funds for good causes. Since we first launched fundraising tools more than five years ago, our community has raised more than $5 billion for nonprofits and personal causes on Facebook and Instagram. The holiday season is a time when many of us think about how we can give something back. With GivingTuesday around the corner on November 30th, we’re offering people more ways to give back to their communities across our apps. Fundraising on GivingTuesday GivingTuesday is a day when people all around the world come together to support causes that are important to them. In celebration of our community’s generosity, we will match up to $8 million in eligible donations made to fundraisers on Facebook for nonprofits in the United States. You can learn more about eligibility, the match structure and donation caps. Find a nonprofit to support by going to facebook.com/fundraisers. And to celebrate Instagram’s 11th birthday, we’re matching the fundraisers of seven creators, up to $50,000 each, through GivingTuesday. We’re also expanding the set of nonprofits that people can fundraise for on Instagram. In the coming weeks, you’ll now be able to raise money for more than 1.5 million organizations by adding a fundraiser to a post. This will be available in countries that support nonprofit fundraisers. As always, 100% of donations raised for nonprofits through fundraisers created on Facebook and Instagram go directly to the organization picked by the donor. All donations are processed securely by Facebook Pay, making it easy to donate in just a few taps. New Ways to Support Your Local Community People are increasingly using Facebook to help the vulnerable in their local communities, support small businesses and share information in local groups. So, we’re expanding tests of Neighborhoods, a single destination to build and strengthen local communities on Facebook, to an additional 132 cities in the United States. We’re also testing a new Giving Exchange feature for people to offer items they’re no longer using to others. Finding a Cause You’re Passionate About On GivingTuesday, teams of gaming creators will go live in Warzone on Facebook Gaming as part of a tournament to raise money for their nonprofit of choice. Each team will use our charity livestreaming tools, select a nonprofit and encourage donations from their audiences during the broadcast. Additionally, a total prize pool of $25,000 from Meta will be donated to the top four teams’ selected nonprofits, made in the teams’ names. You can watch and donate between 11:00AM and 3:00PM PT on November 30 at fb.gg/facebookgaming. We’ve also brought back our #BuyBlack Friday campaign, which we started last year to harness some of the energy from the biggest physical retail day of the year in support of Black-owned small businesses. In the US, Black-owned businesses continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic, and this holiday season will be make or break for many of them. More than a third of US Black-owned businesses expect to make at least half of their annual revenue in the last three months of the year. The #BuyBlack Friday show, hosted by NY Times best-selling author, journalist and television host, Elaine Welteroth, airs every Friday in November on Facebook. Tune into upcoming episodes on November 19th and November 26th featuring two great small businesses – House of Takura and Beaux & Paws. You can also find great ideas for presents and stocking fillers in our #BuyBlack Friday gift guide collections, which are available all month long in both the Facebook and Instagram Shop tabs.

With Product Recommendations and Shops in Groups, we’re bridging community and commerce. With an early test of Live Shopping for creators, we’re also creating new opportunities for brands, creators and people to build relationships. We’re helping people make more informed purchases through reviews and information from other shoppers. Gone are the days when shopping meant stacks of catalogs and infomercials. Today we look to our friends, family, creators and groups we trust for inspiration. With more than 1.8 billion people using Facebook Groups every month, today we’re introducing new ways to shop in Groups and get inspiration from friends and creators you trust on Facebook: Engage with Your Community Through Shopping We’re introducing Shops in Groups so you can support the communities you care about by buying products from them. For example, members of OctoNation, an octopus fan group, can now buy stickers, mugs and apparel to show their love of octopuses. People often ask members of groups for recommendations on their experience with a product and how it performs. With Product Recommendations in Groups, we’ll show products that members recommend when you ask for guidance within a group and make it easy to purchase those products from shops on Facebook. We’re also introducing Top Product Mentions in News Feed as a way to help you discover products that were recommended by peers from groups that you’re a part of. Today we’re creating educational and fun shopping events that bring together a community of fans, creators and brands. We’re beginning to test Live Shopping for creators to make it easier for the creators you already know and trust to partner with brands and highlight their favorite products. Product Recommendations in Groups Top Product Mentions Live Shopping for creators OctoNation, a nonprofit organization working to educate people about octopuses, is already using Shops in Groups to engage with their members: “Allowing our members to view and purchase OctoNation’s products in a trusted space they were familiar with has significantly increased sales. This enhanced stream of income has allowed us to bring some of our volunteers into paid positions and increase our profit margins by ordering in bulk. Merch allows OctoNation to foster a stronger sense of community by giving group members an opportunity to display their love of octopuses, start conversations on a topic they love and recruit other members into our community.” – Warren Carlyle, founder and CEO, OctoNation Shops in Groups Get Information from Others and Make More Informed Purchases Community replies allows you to see and respond to questions from people who are considering buying an item that you’ve already purchased, and vice versa. Shoppers want to feel confident in the purchases they make, and we’ve recently expanded ratings and reviews we’re giving people more information before they buy on Facebook and Instagram. Now you can shop more confidently with reviews from e-commerce sites, provided by Bazaarvoice and Yotpo. By tagging brands you’ve purchased from in your posts on Instagram, businesses can add your images to their shop’s product detail pages. This way, other shoppers can see your photo of the product and feel more confident making a purchase. Our communities are central to how we discover trends, brands and products, and these new tools will make it easier to get inspiration and information from friends, groups, creators and others."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/facebook-widely-viewed-content-report-q3-2021/","date":"2021-11-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Widely Viewed Content Report, Third Quarter 2021","text":"We’re publishing the Widely Viewed Content Report for the third quarter of 2021 to highlight the most viewed organic content in News Feed, which includes posts about people’s favorite movies and Pages dedicated to personal interests. We’ll continue to meet with academics and experts to discuss these reports in detail and consider their input when exploring product changes tied to this work. Today we’re publishing the Widely Viewed Content Report (WVCR) for the third quarter of 2021. This is the second edition of this report, which highlights the most viewed organic content in News Feed, including domains, links, Pages and posts in the US. This report includes content recommended by Facebook and excludes advertising content. Read more about its scope and methodology in our Companion Guide. There’s been a lot written about polarizing content dominating News Feed, so this report sheds more light on the types of content that reaches the most people, which includes posts about people’s favorite movies and Pages dedicated to entertainment, cooking and family. Still, these reports have highlighted gaps in our enforcements and demotions, which we’re taking immediate steps to address. Updates Since the Q2 Report Since releasing our inaugural WVCR, we have engaged with academics, civil society groups and researchers to identify the parts of our first report they found most valuable, which metrics needed more context and how we can best support their understanding of content distribution on Facebook. Based on these discussions, we’ve provided more clarity into our methodology and included more context in the Companion Guide. Moving forward, we’ll continue to work with external stakeholders to refine and improve these reports. Removing Violating Content We remove content from Facebook when it poses a real risk of harm, like graphic violence, hate speech or fake COVID cures. Our Community Standards prohibit hateful or harmful content, and we invest heavily in developing ways of identifying it and acting on it quickly. Learnings from our first WVCR have led to better applications and development of existing policies, including the removal of a network of more than a hundred Pages, profiles and domains for inauthentic behavior. Reducing Low-Quality Content We also use News Feed ranking to reduce the distribution of posts that may contain content people find objectionable, but don’t necessarily meet the bar of removal under our policies. In creating these reports, we learned that our efforts to reduce engagement bait and low quality content needed to be refined to address more of it, which has led to changes in how we identify and reduce it. For example, we’re expanding our engagement bait identifiers, evaluating the impact that comments from friends can have on showing unconnected posts in News Feed, and experimenting with reducing that impact. We’re also exploring new experiments to reduce posts with unrelated links. We anticipate that these changes may lead to a reduction of low-quality content in future reports; however, it may take several reporting cycles for our reduction efforts to make a noticeable impact. Ongoing Work and Transparency We are committed to sharing more about the changes we’re making based on what we’ve learned from the WVCR. We will also continue to meet with academics and experts to discuss these reports in detail and consider their input when exploring new tests or product changes tied to this work.

We’re announcing a new experience that brings together the best of Pages and Groups into one place, allowing admins to use an official voice with their communities. Today, we’re hosting the Facebook Communities Summit and announcing new tools in Facebook Groups that empower community builders to accomplish more together. As communities continue to evolve, we want to make it easier for people to collaborate in new ways and have fun while they’re doing it. We also continue to invest in new ways to keep groups on our platform safe. Build the Community You Want and Strengthen Culture Every group develops its own culture. To make their groups look and feel unique, admins will be able to: Easily customize the colors, post backgrounds and fonts that display in groups, along with the emojis members can use to react to content. Use feature sets to select preset collections of post formats, badges, admin tools and more that can be turned on for their group with one click, so that communities can engage in the ways they want. Suggest preferred formats for members to use when they post in their group. This will appear in a new posting button that stays with members as they browse the group, eliminating the need to scroll back to the top when they’re ready to post. Create a unique greeting message and share group rules that new members will automatically receive when they join a group, so they can develop a sense of belonging sooner. Members will also soon be able to give community awards, like Insightful, Uplifting or Fun, to content that they find valuable. These awards encourage engagement, make the content more visible to members and help demonstrate the group’s content at its best. Deepen Connections With one main feed for discussions in a group, it can be hard for members to find content they want to engage with. We’re testing the ability for admins to create subgroups within their groups for specific topics, regions or occasions, that can be managed in one place, so that members can more easily go deeper on what they care about. When people want to connect in real-time, they will soon be able to use Community Chats in both Facebook and Messenger, as well as create recurring events when they want to get together more regularly, either virtually or in-person. Manage Your Community These new tools will help make it easier for admins to manage their groups: Admins can pin announcements and choose the order in which they show up in a new Featured section at the top of groups, to ensure their community sees the most important details first. We’re updating Admin Assist to give personalized suggestions on criteria to add, provide more information around why Admin Assist declines certain content and make Admin Assist accessible across all platforms with availability on Facebook Lite. Community Chats will allow admins to create a chat for the admin and moderator team so that they can better coordinate decisions in real time. Sustain Your Community We’re also introducing a suite of tools to help admins sustain their efforts and advance the purpose of the group. We’re testing the ability for admins to: Create community fundraisers to raise money for group projects, to offset the costs of running the group or to enable members to show their appreciation for their admins and moderators. Sell merchandise they’ve created through a shop in their group, enabling members to show their support and deepen their sense of community. Create paid subgroups that members can subscribe to for a fee to gain exclusive access to more content, experiences like coaching or networking or deeper conversations. As part of our broader paid subscription effort across Facebook, this new feature enables admins to sustain their communities while offering more meaningful experiences to their members. With different ways to earn or raise money through their groups, admins can tailor their approach to what works best for their community. A New Vision For Communities on Facebook Some communities use both Groups and Pages to connect with people, which can be more time intensive for admins to manage and unclear to members where to go for what. So, we’re introducing a new consumer experience that brings the best of Pages and Groups into one place. For admins of Facebook Groups, the new experience will allow them to use an official voice when interacting with their community. For admins of Facebook Pages, the new experience will help them build community in a single space for members to participate and engage. Admins of Pages will also be able to take advantage of the moderation tools that Groups have today. This new experience is in early testing over the next year, before it becomes more broadly available. During today’s Facebook Communities Summit, we’ll also celebrate and recognize the diverse communities on Facebook through our first-ever Community Day and the Facebook Community Awards.

We need to weigh the positive use cases for facial recognition against growing societal concerns, especially as regulators have yet to provide clear rules. In the coming weeks, Meta will shut down the Face Recognition system on Facebook as part of a company-wide move to limit the use of facial recognition in our products. As part of this change, people who have opted in to our Face Recognition setting will no longer be automatically recognized in photos and videos, and we will delete the facial recognition template used to identify them. This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology’s history. More than a third of Facebook’s daily active users have opted in to our Face Recognition setting and are able to be recognized, and its removal will result in the deletion of more than a billion people’s individual facial recognition templates. Making this change required careful consideration, because we have seen a number of places where face recognition can be highly valued by people using platforms. For example, our award-winning automatic alt text system, that uses advanced AI to generate descriptions of images for people who are blind and visually impaired, uses the Face Recognition system to tell them when they or one of their friends is in an image. For many years, Facebook has also given people the option to be automatically notified when they appear in photos or videos posted by others, and provided recommendations for who to tag in photos. These features are also powered by the Face Recognition system which we are shutting down. Looking ahead, we still see facial recognition technology as a powerful tool, for example, for people needing to verify their identity, or to prevent fraud and impersonation. We believe facial recognition can help for products like these with privacy, transparency and control in place, so you decide if and how your face is used. We will continue working on these technologies and engaging outside experts. But the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole. There are many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society, and regulators are still in the process of providing a clear set of rules governing its use. Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate. This includes services that help people gain access to a locked account, verify their identity in financial products or unlock a personal device. These are places where facial recognition is both broadly valuable to people and socially acceptable, when deployed with care. While we will continue working on use cases like these, we will ensure people have transparency and control over whether they are automatically recognized. But like most challenges involving complex social issues, we know the approach we’ve chosen involves some difficult tradeoffs. For example, the ability to tell a blind or visually impaired user that the person in a photo on their News Feed is their high school friend, or former colleague, is a valuable feature that makes our platforms more accessible. But it also depends on an underlying technology that attempts to evaluate the faces in a photo to match them with those kept in a database of people who opted-in. The changes we’re announcing today involve a company-wide move away from this kind of broad identification, and toward narrower forms of personal authentication. Facial recognition can be particularly valuable when the technology operates privately on a person’s own devices. This method of on-device facial recognition, requiring no communication of face data with an external server, is most commonly deployed today in the systems used to unlock smartphones. We believe this has the potential to enable positive use cases in the future that maintain privacy, control and transparency, and it’s an approach we’ll continue to explore as we consider how our future computing platforms and devices can best serve people’s needs. For potential future applications of technologies like this, we’ll continue to be public about intended use, how people can have control over these systems and their personal data, and how we’re living up to our responsible innovation framework. Ending the use of our existing Face Recognition system means the services it enables will be removed over the coming weeks, as will the setting allowing people to opt into the system. This will lead to a number of changes: Our technology will no longer automatically recognize if people’s faces appear in Memories, photos or videos. People will no longer be able to turn on face recognition for suggested tagging or see a suggested tag with their name in photos and videos they may appear in. We’ll still encourage people to tag posts manually, to help you and your friends know who is in a photo or video. This change will also impact Automatic Alt Text (AAT), a technology used to create image descriptions for people who are blind or visually impaired. AAT currently identifies people in about 4% of photos. After the change, AAT will still be able to recognize how many people are in a photo, but will no longer attempt to identify who each person is using facial recognition. Otherwise, AAT will continue to function normally, and we’ll work closely with the blind and visually impaired community on technologies to continually improve AAT. You can learn more about what these changes mean for people who use AAT on the Facebook Accessibility page. If you have opted into our Face Recognition setting, we will delete the template used to identify you. If you have the face recognition setting turned off, there is no template to delete and there will be no change. Every new technology brings with it potential for both benefit and concern, and we want to find the right balance. In the case of facial recognition, its long-term role in society needs to be debated in the open, and among those who will be most impacted by it. We will continue engaging in that conversation and working with the civil society groups and regulators who are leading this discussion."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/shop-on-facebook-instagram-holiday-season/","date":"2021-10-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News"],"title":"Shop What You Love on Facebook and Instagram This Holiday Season","text":"Starting November 1, we’ll host daily Live Shopping experiences on Facebook and Instagram with brands like Benefit Cosmetics, Cocokind, Macy’s, Paintbox Nails, Tanya Taylor, Ulta Beauty, Vuori and Walmart to educate shoppers and share exclusive deals.

Today, we are announcing measures to curb attempts to sell land in ecological conservation areas within the Amazon rainforest on Facebook Marketplace. We are updating our commerce policies to explicitly prohibit the buying or selling of land of any type in ecological conservation areas on our commerce products across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. We will now review listings on Facebook Marketplace against an international organization’s authoritative database of protected areas to identify listings that may violate this new policy. Protected areas are crucial for conserving habitats and ecosystems and are critical to tackling the global nature crisis. Based on specific criteria, Facebook will seek to identify and block new listings in such areas. By using complementary information sources like this database, we are adding another barrier for people trying to list these lands on Marketplace. We are announcing this today, and enforcement will now begin to ramp up. Over time, we will observe how this process works and make improvements as appropriate. Our commerce policies continue to require buyers and sellers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using Facebook Inc. commerce surfaces. These are the first steps Facebook is taking to address this issue, and as with other integrity initiatives we will continue working to prevent people from circumventing our enforcement.

We’re bringing short form, entertaining video experiences and tools that have inspired creators on Instagram to more creators and audiences on the Facebook app. With the ability to create reels and have their Instagram reels suggested to people on Facebook, creators — whether they’re just starting out or already have a large following — will have more ways to express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences. Reels on Facebook can consist of music, audio, effects and more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends. Connect with New Audiences Creators can build an audience with Reels in different ways across Facebook: Get Discovered in News Feed: Reels can reach everyone, not just your existing followers, making it possible for the most creative, funny and inspiring people to break out. People can discover reels based on their interests and what’s popular both at the top of News Feed alongside Stories and Rooms and in a new, dedicated News Feed section. Express Yourself in Groups: Creators and group members can create and share reels in Groups to express themselves and engage in a more fun and visual way with their favorite interest communities, like The Galactic Empire of Chonky Woofers and Post-Apocalypse Office. And for admins, we’re rolling out a new ‘Single Theme’ group setting that makes it easy to prompt members to share their reels. Share from Instagram to Facebook to Reach New Audiences: We’re testing the ability for Instagram creators to have their reels recommended on Facebook. In this test, a small number of Instagram creators will see an option to have their reel recommended on Facebook. The choice to do this is completely in their control. Earn Money for Reels with Bonuses As part of our commitment to invest over $1 billion in creators through 2022, we’re also offering a new bonus program to help creators earn money when people view their reels. The Reels Play bonus pays eligible creators based on the performance of their reels, and will be available on both Facebook and Instagram. After seeing creators embrace the Instagram Reels Summer bonus, we hope this new bonus will allow more creators like @imjeremyclyde to make money from their content: “The ‘Reels Summer’ bonus enhanced my motivation for creating more Reels and my overall creativity as a content creator. It’s also always great to see other content creators posting more and being the creatives that they are — it’s inspiring!” The Reels Play bonus will initially be invite-only, beginning in the US and potentially expanding globally over time. Interested creators can sign up to learn more about the Facebook Reels Play bonus and can visit our Facebook for Creators blog to learn best practices for creating reels. We’re focused on developing a suite of creator monetization options and will explore additional opportunities for them to earn money for their Reels. On Facebook, we will test sticker ads and banner ads in Reels and explore integrating with Stars. And similar to Instagram Reels, we’ll soon begin testing full-screen and immersive ads between reels to help small businesses and brands connect with new audiences in delightful ways. Just like with organic Reels content, people can comment, like, view, save, share and skip them. Unleash Your Creativity with Reels Anyone can create a reel on Facebook and become a creator on the global stage or just share them with friends and family. Simply create a reel from the top of Feed or while you’re watching a reel and either select video clips from your camera roll or capture something new. You can also tap Reels at the top of News Feed or within a group’s feed. As you’re creating reels on Facebook, you can access a variety of creative editing tools, including: Audio: Search for a song from the Facebook music library for your reel. You can also use your own original audio by simply recording a reel with it. You can add audio from the camera before you capture a clip, or you can add audio later after you have captured or uploaded a clip. You can also create a reel with original audio from other public reels by selecting Use Audio from the other person’s reel. AR Effects: Select one of the many effects in our augmented reality library, created by either Facebook or third-party developers, to record multiple clips with different effects. Timer and Countdown: Set the timer to record any of your clips hands-free without having to press the shutter button. Speed: Speed up or slow down the video while you record, which helps you stay on a beat or make slow motion videos. Multi-clip: Stitch together multiple clips into a single reel either by recording them together or selecting them from the gallery. After you’ve created a reel, you can choose how to share it. Reels on Facebook are set to be public for creators who are over 18, but you can change the audience at any time. Audience options include Public, Friends or Friends except."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/content-distribution-guidelines/","date":"2021-09-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy"],"title":"Sharing Our Content Distribution Guidelines","text":"Update on December 15, 2021 at 9:45AM PT: Today, as part of our ongoing efforts to provide more visibility into our content ranking processes, we have made the first update to the Content Distribution Guidelines. Today’s update includes revised definitions of content we identify as borderline and likely violating our community standards, sensational health content and unoriginal video content. As we continue to evaluate the types of problematic and low-quality content and behavior that we think should receive reduced distribution on our platform, we will regularly make these periodic updates to the Guidelines with amendments archived in the change log. The Guidelines and amendments can both be found in our Transparency Center. Originally published on September 23, 2021 at 2:00PM PT: Today, we’re publishing Facebook’s Content Distribution Guidelines to share more detail on how content is distributed on Facebook. While the Community Standards make it clear what content is removed from Facebook because we don’t allow it on the platform, the Content Distribution Guidelines make it clear what content receives reduced distribution on News Feed because it’s problematic or low quality. Many of these guidelines have been shared in various announcements, but in efforts to provide clarity and make them more accessible, we want to bring them together in one easy-to-navigate space in our Transparency Center. As we work to improve News Feed, we rely on overarching core values to guide that process. The changes we make, particularly ones focused on limiting the spread of problematic content, are based on extensive feedback from our global community and external experts. Over the last few years, we’ve consulted more than 100 stakeholders across a range of relevant focus areas to solicit feedback on how to bring more insightful transparency to our efforts to reduce problematic content. We’ve previously discussed our efforts to reduce the distribution of problematic or low-quality content based on the needs of people, creators, and our community. There are three principal reasons why we might reduce the distribution of content: Responding to People’s Direct Feedback: We listen to people’s feedback about what they like and don’t like seeing on Facebook and make changes to News Feed in response. Incentivizing Creators to Invest in High-Quality and Accurate Content: We want people to have interesting new material to engage with in the long term, so we’re working to set incentives that encourage the creation of these types of content. Fostering a Safer Community: Some content may be problematic for our community, regardless of the intent. We’ll make this content more difficult for people to encounter. What’s Next? We’ll continue to update the Content Distribution Guidelines to provide people with information about how we define and treat problematic or low-quality content that doesn’t otherwise violate our Community Standards. How Will This Impact My Page? Content Distribution Guidelines are already in effect today, some globally and others specific to certain locations. Our Publisher Guidelines continue to provide specific information relevant to creators interested in learning more about distribution on Facebook. We’ll also continue to expand our Page Quality tab to help provide more transparency into policies that may be affecting a Page."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/state-officials-covid-19-announcements/","date":"2021-09-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Helping State Officials Share COVID-19 Information with Local Communities","text":"It’s critical to reach people at the local level when facing challenges such as public health crises.

Our staff have used Facebook’s COVID Announcement Tool to reach residents more broadly and to overcome common communications barriers, certainly resulting in more people getting vaccinated and more safety for our city as a whole.” – Mayor Mike Coffman, Aurora, Colorado When authorities mark posts as COVID-19 Announcements, we expand their reach so more people see them. We also send notifications about these posts to local community members and make the information visible in the COVID-19 Information Center. “Thanks to Facebook’s support in helping us promote COVID-19 information on social media, Alabama residents have been kept informed about updated health guidance regarding mask wearing, social distancing, handwashing, and vaccine distribution. We have seen the impact this support has had in reaching our community at this critical time.” – Alabama Department of Public Health Since launching this feature in the US in May, we’ve sent out more than 183 million notifications driving people to COVID-19 announcements from their state and local governments. “Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Linn County Public Health has been committed and devoted to providing ongoing updates about the disease — and more recently about the vaccines — based on current science and data to our neighbors. Facebook’s COVID-19 Announcements tool has helped inform our community of important information.

Games We’re Launching This Fall Available today, daily sports prediction game Pick & Play Sports is the first game we’re launching, in partnership with Whistle Sports. Fans will get points for correctly predicting the winner of a big game, the points scored by a top player or specific events that unfold during a match. Players can earn bonus points for building a streak of correct predictions over a series of days. In the upcoming months, we will introduce new games with TV shows like CBS’s Survivor and ABC’s The Bachelorette, sports leagues like Major League Baseball and LaLiga Santander and premier digital publishers like BuzzFeed. Fantasy Survivor Each week, fans will select a set of Castaways to be on their Fantasy Survivor team and answer a series of questions about the upcoming episode. Fans will then receive points based on the events that unfold in that week’s episode. MLB Home Run Picks For each day during the MLB Postseason, fans can pick the teams that they think will hit the most home runs during that day’s action. Fans will then earn points based on correct predictions and whether their team hits home runs or grand slams — with extra points coming for those hit late in the game. Fantasy: “The Bachelorette” Each week, fans will select a group from the men vying for Michelle Young’s heart to be on their Fantasy: “The Bachelorette” team and answer a series of questions about the upcoming episode. Fans will then receive points based on the actions and events involving the bachelors on their team and face off with their friends to prove who is the biggest Bachelor Nation fan of them all. LaLiga 3 to Win Predict the winning club — or predict a draw — for select LaLiga matches this season. Players earn points for a correct pick, with the goal being to accumulate as many points as possible over the remainder of the season. Players will be able to predict the results for three games per matchday.

Product On Facebook, we’ll have a hub of information, including highlights from official Paralympic broadcast partners, team and athlete overviews, a Paralympic Games quiz, posts from friends and more. Fans can visit the hub beginning August 23 by clicking on the #Paralympics hashtag. Via the @Paralympics Instagram account, fans will have access to an AR effect that enables them to attempt to mirror the movements of Someity, the official Paralympics mascot, and earn AR medals for their performances. The @Wethe15 Instagram account will also feature an AR effect to help fans promote the “We the 15” movement, which aims to end discrimination against people with disabilities, who make up 15% of the global population. Content People will also be able to enjoy a range of Paralympic-related content across the Facebook family of technologies. We’ve teamed up with the IPC to build “Paralympics Raw: Emotion Unites Us,” an immersive WebXR visual and spatial audio experience that recreates phenomenal moments by Para athletes. The experience features the voices of athletes — including Birgit Skarstein, Katie Kelly, Chan Ho Yuen, Lex Gillette and Abbas Karimi — who share their stories of competing in Para Sport and at the Paralympic Games. With animated visuals and spatial sound, people feel like they’re in the moment with the athlete. Fans can access the experience by visiting https://www.paralympic.org/raw-emotions via their desktop, mobile or Oculus browsers beginning August 24. Over the course of the competition, the IPC will also deliver a steady cadence of live programming and highlights on the Paralympic Games Facebook Page. Earlier this summer, we launched a Reels-centric series on the @instagram account, which brought fans behind the scenes with Para athletes as they prepared for Tokyo. We’ve also worked with the IPC to launch a four-part film series on Facebook Watch that explores how sport has created a positive change for disabled communities around the world, in support of #WeThe15. Available via the Paralympic Games Facebook Page, the series highlights how Facebook helps communities in the US, UK, Brazil and New Zealand come together online — and the real-world impact it has offline. The US film features Dylan Hronec, also known as the “Surfing Samurai,” an adaptive surfer from New York. Dylan is part of the Surf For All community, a non-profit that aims to help people from all walks of life experience the joy of surfing. He explains how Facebook helps adaptive surfers find out about the community. The UK film features The Derby Wheelblazers, a competitive wheelchair basketball team that welcomes anyone of any ability. The story focuses on Joe Hinsley, who has spina bifida. Joe shares the transformative role sport can have, helping him grow from a shy kid to a confident player and assistant coach. In the film, he talks about how Facebook helps the group overcome the challenge of recruiting new members and bond as a community. The Brazil film highlights the Associação Bola pra Frente Esportes Adaptados, a São Paulo-based football team for players with disabilities, focusing on amputees. It features Daniel, whose leg was amputated after a motorcycle crash. He explains how, through Facebook, the association can reach and inspire more people with disabilities. The New Zealand film spotlights the Te Arawa Swimming Club, an inclusive, community-run club in Rotorua that believes swimming should be accessible to all. It covers the story of Siobhan Terry, who was born with clubfoot. Through swimming, the opportunities the Te Arawa Swimming Club has offered her, and the use of Facebook, Terry has gone on to not only coach other new Para swimming recruits, but also become an ambassador for the sport and a 2024 Paralympic Games hopeful."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/community-standards-enforcement-report-q2-2021/","date":"2021-08-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Community Standards Enforcement Report, Second Quarter 2021","text":"Today we’re publishing the Community Standards Enforcement Report for the second quarter of 2021. This report provides metrics on how we enforced our policies from April through June. This is our 10th report and some of our long-term trends include: Prevalence of hate speech has decreased for three quarters in a row since we first began reporting it. This is due to improvements in proactively detecting hate speech and ranking changes in News Feed. Hate speech content removal has increased over 15X on Facebook and Instagram since we first began reporting it. Our proactive rate (​​the percentage of content we took action on that we found before a user reported it to us) is over 90% for 12 out of 13 policy areas on Facebook and nine out of 11 on Instagram. We now include 13 policy areas on Facebook and 11 on Instagram, and have added new metrics on appeals, restores, and prevalence. In addition to our Community Standards Enforcement Report, this quarter we’re also sharing: The newly released Widely Viewed Content Report Ongoing updates on our efforts to promote reliable information about COVID-19 and vaccines and reduce harmful misinformation We’re committed to sharing meaningful data so we can be held accountable for our progress, even if the data shows areas where we need to do better. Today, we’re also releasing the first in a series of reports that will give an overview of the most widely-viewed content in Facebook’s News Feed, starting with the top 20 most viewed domains, links, Pages and posts in the US. These reports are public in the Transparency Center and we will include them with each quarterly Community Standards Enforcement Report going forward. Promoting Reliable Information and Reducing Harmful Misinformation About COVID-19 COVID-19 is still a major public health issue, and we are committed to helping people get authoritative information, including vaccine information. We continue to remove harmful COVID-19 misinformation and prohibit ads that try to exploit the pandemic for financial gain. Since the start of the pandemic through June: We removed more than 20 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram globally for violating our policies on COVID-19-related misinformation. We have removed over 3,000 accounts, pages, and groups for repeatedly violating our rules against spreading COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation. We displayed warnings on more than 190 million pieces of COVID-related content on Facebook that our third-party fact-checking partners rated as false, partly false, altered or missing context, collaborating with 80 fact-checking organizations in more than 60 languages around the world. When they rate a piece of content with one of these ratings, we add a prominent label warning people before they share it and show it lower in people’s feed. We’ve provided authoritative information to help improve vaccine acceptance, connecting 2 billion people to resources from health experts through our COVID-19 Information Center and educational pop-ups on Facebook and Instagram and helping 4 million people in the US alone access vaccines through our vaccine finder tool. We know from public health research that people are more likely to get vaccinated if they see others in their community doing so. In countries where vaccines are available to most people, we ramped up our efforts to show when friends and neighbors share their support for vaccines through profile frames and stickers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 18 million people globally have used Facebook profile frames supporting vaccines. More than 25% of people globally on Facebook have already seen someone use the UNICEF COVID-19 vaccine profile frames. Over 29% of people globally on Instagram have seen someone use a COVID-19 vaccine sticker. Instagram COVID-19 vaccine stickers have been used by more than 7.6 million people globally. For people in the US on Facebook, vaccine hesitancy has declined by 50%. Globally, we have also seen vaccine acceptance rising. For example, our COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey data which we conduct in partnership with Carnegie-Mellon and University of Maryland has since the beginning of the year shown vaccine acceptance rising by 35 percent in France, 25 percent in Indonesia, and 20 percent in Nigeria. Community Standards Enforcement Report Highlights Progress on Hate Speech Prevalence of hate speech on Facebook continued to decrease for the third quarter in a row. In Q2, it was 0.05%, or 5 views per 10,000 views, down from 0.05-0.06%, or 5 to 6 views per 10,000 views in Q1. We removed 31.5 million pieces of hate speech content from Facebook, compared to 25.2 million in Q1, and 9.8 million from Instagram, up from 6.3 million in Q1. This is due to continued improvement in our proactive detection. Our investments in AI enable us to detect more kinds of hate speech violations on Facebook and Instagram. This technology helps us enforce our policies across billions of users and multiple languages. Steady, continuous AI improvements and advancements, such as the Reinforcement Integrity Optimizer (RIO), enable our AI models to spot hate speech using real-world data and improve over time. Updates in Child Safety Keeping children safe on our apps is critical. Previously, we reported one metric, child nudity and sexual exploitation of children. In our latest report, we’ve added more data and created two new reporting categories under the broader topic of child endangerment: 1) nudity and physical abuse and 2) sexual exploitation. We changed this to provide a more detailed, transparent overview of our efforts in this space to child safety experts, academics and the general public. Child nudity and physical abuse content we took action on: On Facebook: 2.3 million with a proactive rate over 97% On Instagram: 458,000 with a proactive rate of over 95% Child sexual exploitation content we took action on: On Facebook: 25.7 million with a proactive rate of over 99% On Instagram: 1.4 million with a proactive rate of over 96% In Q2 2021, we improved our proactive detection technology on videos and expanded our media-matching technology on Facebook, allowing us to remove more old, violating content. Both enabled us to take action on more violating content. Recent Trends In addition to new categories and ongoing improvements in reducing prevalence, we saw steady progress across many problem areas. On Facebook in Q2 we took action on: 6.2 million pieces of organized hate content, compared to 9.8 million pieces in Q1 2021 — this marks a return to pre-Q1 levels as we update our proactive detection technology 16.8 million pieces of suicide and self-injury content, compared to 5.1 million pieces in Q1 2021 — due to a technical fix we made that allowed us to go back and catch violating content we missed 34.1 million pieces of violent and graphic content, compared to 30.1 million pieces in Q1 2021 On Instagram in Q2 we took action on: 367,000 of organized hate content, up from 325,000 in Q1 2021 3 million pieces of suicide and self-injury content, up from 2.6 million in Q1 2021 7.6 million pieces of violent and graphic content, compared to 5.5 million pieces in Q1 2021"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/widely-viewed-content-report/","date":"2021-08-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Introducing the Widely Viewed Content Report","text":"Today, we’re releasing the first in a series of reports that will give an overview of the most widely viewed content in News Feed, starting with domains, links, Pages and posts in the US. The Widely Viewed Content Report will be updated quarterly in the Transparency Center and will be released in conjunction with each quarterly Community Standards Enforcement Report. Our inaugural report contains some noteworthy takeaways: The content that’s seen by the most people isn’t necessarily the content that also gets the most engagement. Read more about how engagement — the likes, shares, and comments a Page or post generates — doesn’t equate to its reach, the number of people who actually see it. The majority (57%) of posts that people see is from their family and friends, in line with changes we made in the past so that content from friends and family makes up a larger portion of News Feed. Fewer than 13% of content views were on posts with links, and the top-viewed news domains account for only 0.31% of all content views in News Feed. Of those outlets, mainstream media dominate by views. We’ve explained before why only a small portion of News Feed is news. This report sheds light on the kinds of posts and Pages that are actually the most widely viewed — with many of the most-viewed Pages focused on sharing content about pets, cooking, family, and relatable viral content. Our insights tool, CrowdTangle, was built to help people get an idea of content from Pages that gets the most likes, comments and reshares. We want this data to be broadly available to people, which is why we’re publishing it directly in our Transparency Center. We see this as a complement to insights that can be found through CrowdTangle, which is primarily a tool used by publishers. It’s important to note that there is so much content on Facebook that even the most-viewed content is still a small portion of what people see. Given the customized nature of News Feed, most of what people see on Facebook is uniquely personalized to them. To paint a complete picture and provide more extensive detail of what people actually see on Facebook, we’ll release Widely Viewed Content Reports on a quarterly basis, starting in the US and eventually including more international data. Transparency is part of everything we do, and releasing these reports is the latest step in our efforts to share data and hold ourselves accountable. Whether it’s sharing our content enforcement progress through the Community Standards Enforcement Report, submitting ourselves to external audit, working to release new data and tools (like the recently-announced Researcher API) to researchers through Facebook Open Research and Transparency (FORT), or expanding our Data for Good partnerships to help address COVID-19 or disaster relief, we’re committed to sharing useful and accurate information with the public.

These updates include user experience improvements, two new destinations: Photobucket and Google Calendar, and one new data type: Facebook Events. We’re excited about these new changes because they provide people with even more choice and control, while also fostering innovation with our partners. This update includes: A completely rebuilt experience that’s simpler and more intuitive — people can now more easily see what destinations and what data types are supported Greater transparency around the status of each transfer, including making it easier to retry certain transfers The ability to simultaneously start multiple data transfers for one destination Filters that allow people to more precisely select the data they want to transfer At Facebook, we plan to continue providing our users with secure data portability features they can trust. We’re also working with developers to expand the selection of data types and destinations we support. However, to ensure user data is safe both while it is being transferred and after, we’re continuing to call for government regulation to make clearer rules about who is responsible for protecting that data as it is transferred to different services. In the meantime, we’ll keep contributing to the open source Data Transfer Project, supporting innovation in data portability across the industry and pushing the technology forward.

Every setting that lived in Privacy Shortcuts lives in the redesigned Settings page or in Help & Support. Our research shows that our new mobile Settings page improves people’s experience. Originally published on August 4, 2021 at 12:00PM PT: As part of our ongoing efforts to improve people’s experience on Facebook, we’ve redesigned the Facebook Settings page to make our tools easier to find. We’ve streamlined the layout, while keeping all the previous settings. Whether it’s managing the ads people see, adjusting sharing settings, or curating an audience for posts, people shouldn’t have to think too hard about where to start. That’s why we’ve reduced the number of categories, and renamed them to more closely match people’s mental models. Settings are now grouped into six broad categories, each containing several related settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies. We’ve also relocated several standalone settings so that they live alongside related settings. For example, the News Feed setting, which previously lived in a smaller category of its own, now lives under Preferences where it is grouped with similar settings. We’ve also made some improvements to the settings search function, making it easier to find the settings you need if you don’t know the exact name or location of the setting you’re looking for. Our research shows that using more specific and descriptive names makes settings easier to find. That’s why we’ve unbundled the Privacy Settings category and moved the settings previously contained within it into other categories. Finally, to more easily guide you through important privacy and security settings on Facebook, we’ve added another shortcut to Privacy Checkup, right at the top of the Settings landing page. As we said in our Privacy Progress update earlier this year, we strive to design products and features with privacy in mind. Part of that means making information and tools accessible and easy to find. We’re confident this new settings page will make it easier for people to visit their settings, find what they came for, and make the changes they want. The Facebook Settings redesign rolls out August 4 for Android, iOS, mobile web and FB Lite.

We’re developing AI to find and remove underaged accounts, and new solutions to verify people’s ages. We’re also building new experiences designed specifically for those under 13. As per our terms, we require people to be at least 13 years old to sign up for Facebook or Instagram. In some countries, our minimum age is higher. When people open our apps to sign up for an account, we ask them for their birthday. This is called an age screen. Those who are underage are not allowed to sign up, and we restrict people who repeatedly try to enter different birthdays into the age screen. But verifying someone’s age is not as simple as it might sound. While age screens are common in our industry, young people can — and often do — get around them by misrepresenting their age. So how are we addressing this problem? Understanding people’s age on the internet is a complex challenge across our industry, and we already have various methods of finding and removing accounts used by people who misrepresent their age. For example, anyone can report an underage account to us. Our content reviewers are also trained to flag reported accounts that appear to be used by people who are underage. If these people are unable to prove they meet our minimum age requirements, we delete their accounts. Many argue that collecting ID is the answer to this industry problem, but there are significant limitations to this approach: many young people don’t have an ID, ID collection isn’t a fair or equitable solution, nor is it foolproof. Access to government IDs varies depending on where you live in the world, as does the information contained in an ID such as a birthday. Some have access to IDs but don’t get them unless they choose to travel, and some simply can’t afford one. Indeed, lack of ID access disproportionately impacts underserved communities around the world, particularly young women. Even if they did have an ID, some young people may be uncomfortable sharing it. For example, perhaps they’re a young member of the LGBTQ+ community and they worry about having their identity attached to a pseudonymous account. While these are not new problems to solve, we will continue to invest in finding the right solutions. We need to keep people who are too young off of Facebook and Instagram, and we want to make sure that those who are old enough receive the appropriate experience for their age. Today, we’re sharing how we’re tackling this issue from multiple angles. Here are a few examples. Using AI to Detect Age Artificial intelligence is the cornerstone of the approach we’re taking. We’ve developed technology that allows us to estimate people’s ages, like if someone is below or above 18. We train the technology using multiple signals. We look at things like people wishing you a happy birthday and the age written in those messages, for example, “Happy 21st Bday!” or “Happy Quinceañera.” We also look at the age you shared with us on Facebook and apply it to our other apps where you have linked your accounts and vice versa — so if you share your birthday with us on Facebook, we’ll use the same for your linked account on Instagram. This technology isn’t perfect, and we’re always working to improve it, but that’s why it’s important we use it alongside many other signals to understand people’s ages. This technology is also the basis of important changes we’re making to keep young people safe. We’re using it to stop adults from messaging young people that don’t follow them on Instagram. And we announced today that we will no longer showing posts from young people’s accounts, or the accounts themselves, to adults that have shown potentially suspicious behavior. We plan to apply this technology across our apps to create more age-appropriate experiences and safety measures for young people. We’re also building similar technology to find and remove accounts belonging to people under the age of 13. We’re focused on using existing data to inform our artificial intelligence technology. Where we do feel we need more information, we’re developing a menu of options for someone to prove their age. This is a work in progress and we’ll have more to share in time. Working With Industry Partners We’re also in discussions with the wider technology industry on how we can work together to share information in privacy-preserving ways that helps apps establish whether people are over a specific age. One area we believe has real promise is working with operating system (OS) providers, internet browsers and other providers so they can share information to help apps establish whether someone is of an appropriate age. This has the dual benefit of helping developers keep underage people off their apps while removing the need to go through differing and potentially cumbersome age verification processes across multiple apps and services. While it’s ultimately up to individual apps and websites to enforce their age policies and comply with their legal obligations, collaboration with OS providers, internet browsers and others would be a helpful addition to those efforts. Building Experiences for People Under 13 We’re also looking at ways we can reduce the incentive for people under the age of 13 to lie about their age. The reality is that they’re already online, and with no foolproof way to stop people from misrepresenting their age, we want to build experiences designed specifically for them, managed by parents and guardians. This includes a new Instagram experience for tweens. We believe that encouraging them to use an experience that is age appropriate and managed by parents is the right path. It’s going to take a village to make this experience compelling enough so that this age group wants to use it, but we’re determined to get it right. Working With Experts We believe this comprehensive plan is the right one for Facebook and Instagram, but the natural question for readers is how we’re going to do everything in a way that respects people’s privacy, and prioritizes safety at every turn. We’re fortunate to draw from multiple industry experts, organizations and bodies of research here. First, to help us develop new products and features for young people, in 2017 we convened a group of experts in the fields of online safety, child development and children’s media to share their expertise, research and guidance. This group, known as the Youth Advisors, helps shape our work by providing feedback on the development of new products and policies for young people. We meet regularly with the group, which includes the Family Online Safety Institute, Digital Wellness Lab, MediaSmarts, Project Rockit and the Cyberbullying Research Center. We recently expanded this group to add new experts in privacy, youth development, psychology, parenting and youth media, and will continue expanding to include a diverse range of global perspectives. Our new members include: Jutta Croll at Stiftung Digitale Chancen, Pattie Gonsalves at Sangath – It’s Okay To Talk, Vicki Shotbolt at ParentZone UK, Dr. Alfiee M. Breland-Noble at AAKOMA Project, Rachel Rodgers at Northeastern University, Janis Whitlock at Cornell University and Amelia Vance at the Future of Privacy Forum. Next, we continue to welcome productive collaboration with lawmakers and elected officials to guide us. Age verification is a focal point of multiple new and proposed regulatory frameworks on data protection, online harm and child safety. In particular, the ICO Age Appropriate Design Code, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Irish DPC’s Children’s Fundamentals and the EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive, among others, underpin the work we’re doing to create privacy and safety standards for building youth products at Facebook. We plan to share these standards publicly in the coming months. Finally, we’ll continue to take part in dialogues about age verification, developing industry best practices and forming new technical standards. For example, we recently joined the Advisory Board for the euCONSENT Consortium to help develop EU-wide infrastructure for online age verification and parental consent. This is complex territory, with competing interests and considerations. We’re committed to working with experts and the broader industry to give young people a compelling and safe experience on our services."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/connecting-fans-to-tokyo-olympic-games/","date":"2021-07-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News","WhatsApp"],"title":"Connecting Fans to the Games","text":""}]
