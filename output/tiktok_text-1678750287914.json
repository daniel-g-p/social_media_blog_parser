We're lending our support to this year's theme, \"It's Time for Change\" through our in-app campaign spotlighting the creators, resources, and organizations we're partnering with to help foster understanding, reduce stigma, and support recovery. Advocating for changeThis week we're partnering with the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) and the National Alliance for Eating Disorders (The Alliance) to raise awareness about eating disorders. On TikTok people can find more information about this year's Eating Disorder Awareness Week and links to NEDA and The Alliance's life-saving resources, including tips on how to support a loved one dealing with an eating disorder, and access to the organizations' confidential helplines and treatment options.We want everyone to feel safe and supported each time they come to the platform. We know that eating disorders are complex and can present differently from person to person. To help show the diverse forms that they can take and challenge systemic biases—all week long, our community can share their experiences and recovery journeys on TikTok using #ItsTimeforChange. Our hope is that our community feels empowered to express themselves authentically around challenging life experiences. Aiming for the highestEating disorders are a complex and pervasive. We strive to approach the issue with the nuance and care our community deserves. We do not allow content that promotes or normalizes eating disorders or disordered eating, and we redirect searches for phrases related to eating disorders by providing access to National Eating Disorders Association's Helpline and a disordered eating guide that can also be found in our Safety Center.We recognize that what is triggering for one person may not be triggering for another. To give our community more control over their TikTok experience, we've introduced a way for people to filter videos with hashtags or phrases from their For You feeds. We value the trust of those dealing with an eating disorder have in us, and we're committed to continuing to develop policies, work with partners, and introduce measures that promote the well-being of each person that comes to TikTok. It's time for change, and we want to be part of it.“Eating disorders impact the lives of 28.8 million Americans and millions more around the world. Those aged 12 through 25 make up 95% of cases. Eating disorders are serious mental and physical illnesses that can affect people of all genders, ages, races, religions, ethnicities, sexual orientations, body shapes, and weights. NEDA is excited to broaden a collaboration with TikTok to more responsibly use social media as a platform to connect people with the resources they need and foster support, compassion, and care for those living with an eating disorder.” - Sarah Chase, VP of Communication & Marketing, National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA)\"The National Alliance for Eating Disorders is thrilled to be working with TikTok in an effort to raise awareness and elevate the conversation surrounding eating disorders. With more than 29 million Americans that will experience an eating disorder in their lifetime, this year's theme, \"It's Time for Change,\" is even more meaningful and significant. Now is the time for more equity, inclusion, access, outreach, early-intervention, education, representation, advocacy, and awareness.

As we continue to offer our community more ways to enjoy the content they love, we are teaming up with luxury automotive brand, Mercedes-Benz, to bring TikTok inside the newly announced interior of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class.Announced today at the Strategy Update: Mercedes-Benz Operating System event, the E-Class, equipped with new MBUX Superscreen, will have TikTok integrated. From passing time waiting while stationary in your vehicle to simply enjoying a moment to yourself while your car is at rest before heading in to your destination, TikTok will be your new favorite activity when parked, delivering you a stream of videos tailored just for you. Passengers can get in on the fun too! The two screens in the vehicle run independently, so both the driver and passenger can log in to their own accounts and For You feeds. Those without an account can browse as a guest and enjoy a selection of TikTok's top content that has received an extra layer of moderation, making it perfect for adults and teens alike. Available later this year, Mercedes-Benz and TikTok are taking in-car entertainment to innovative new heights.\"With our mobile app, we bring people little moments of joy throughout their day,\" said David Saidden, Director of Distribution Business Development, TikTok. \"As we aim to expand that experience for our users, we're excited to partner with Mercedes-Benz to introduce immersive in-car entertainment, which will give our community more opportunities to enjoy the content they love.\"Safety is at the center of all our initiatives as a company and our partnership with Mercedes-Benz is no exception.

People can then opt to browse as a guest without logging in or opt to login to their TikTok account to receive their tailored For You feed. Specifically designed and configured for E-Class vehicles, users are able to comment, like and enable auto-scrolling for a more leaned back experience.From movie theaters to airplanes to billboards, we are excited to offer people new and exciting ways to experience the entertainment, joy and creativity of TikTok. This collaboration with Mercedes-Benz is an important step forward in our mission to bring the TikTok experience to new screens, venues and audiences."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/mythbusting-the-facts-on-reports-about-our-data-collection-practices","date":"2023-02-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"Mythbusting: The Facts On Reports About Our Data Collection Practices","text":"We welcome legitimate review of our platform and know that staying ahead of next-generation cyber threats requires us to continuously strengthen the security of our platform and collaborate with industry-leading experts to test our defenses. That's why we partner with industry leaders such as HackerOne and it's also why we open the doors of our global Transparency and Accountability Centers for people to learn about source code and how our application’s algorithm operates.On February 13, the Malcore team at Internet 2.0, which describes itself as a joint U.S. and Australian cybersecurity company, published an industry analysis that is at best misleading and at worst a severely flawed and biased analysis. According to the report, Malcore is an automated analysis tool designed to scan files and programs, detect malware and assess risk. Yet by their own admission, the Malcore team used the tool to perform an inconclusive analysis that didn't include a detailed source code review. Their results contained a number of inaccuracies that should cast doubt on the validity of their findings.In response, we had our own researchers conduct a technical analysis of Malcore's findings and below is what we found.Our Data Collection PracticesTikTok does not collect user device IMEI, SIM serial number, or integrated circuit card identification number. The current version of the TikTok app does not use MAC addresses. We encourage users to download the latest version of the app, which includes important security updates.TikTok does not collect all accounts on a device.In regions outside the U.S., where Location Services is available, TikTok collects location information based on a device's GPS data, if Location Services is actively enabled by the user. We do not collect any GPS location data, whether precise or coarse, in the U.S. We use location information to help us improve the app experience and for reasons set out in our Privacy Policy, such as to show users videos and content that are popular in their area, and where applicable, more relevant ads.Additionally, people can choose to allow the platform access to photos, contact lists and the device microphone and camera. We detail the information we collect in our privacy policies and in our help center.Software Development Kits (SDK)A SDK is a set of tools that help software developers create applications for a specific platform. We have a process to assess the overall security risk of any SDK integrated with TikTok. In three cases, the Malcore team incorrectly identified SDK integrations. TikTok does not use Pangle, Google CrashLytics, or Facebook Analytics SDKs. We use the remainder of the SDKs cited in the Malcore analysis in the following ways:Facebook Login SDK and VKontakte SDK (available in only 8 countries) are used to allow users to login using their Facebook or VK credentials. Facebook Share allows users to share content from TikTok to Facebook.Facebook Bolts is an open source SDK to help engineers develop mobile apps. Appsflyer and Google Firebase Analytics are measurement and data analysis tools.Scoring & WeightingThe Malcore team has not offered any explanation of the scoring system that scored TikTok the highest (worst) at 63.1, as compared to the industry standard of 34 for all other major social media apps and average score of 28.8 for all 21 apps.The report arbitrarily lists the assigned scores weights for five factors: tracker/SDKs, dangerous permission, high severity warning for code analysis results, suspicious permission, and severity warning for code analysis results. There is no explanation of why or how these five factors were chosen.Additionally, there's no explanation or external justification for why each factor is assigned the score it's been assigned, with tracker/SDKs given the highest score of 2.5 as compared to the second factor at 0.25 (10 times less) or the fifth factor (50 times less). Changing how any one category is scored would radically alter the risk scores for TikTok and the other apps.Notably, the report itself acknowledges that \"trackers normally are a legitimate software development kit (SDK) designed to help developers understand how their apps are being used, resolve potential issues and improve their software.\" The skewed weighting of SDKs doesn't take into account, for example, that some companies use a master SDK, which would make the number of SDKs an even less meaningful factor to assess risk. In short, Malcore's scoring system simply doesn't make sense.At TikTok, the privacy and security of the people who use our platform are among our highest priorities. We take our responsibility to safeguard people's privacy and security seriously and devote considerable resources to achieve this goal. We plan to continue to provide updates on our practices in our newsroom, help center and our privacy policies."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/unlocking-even-more-opportunities-for-creators-with-the-creativity-program-beta","date":"2023-02-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Unlocking even more opportunities for creators with the Creativity Program Beta","text":"TikTok is a unique place where creativity and authenticity are celebrated.

We are continuously building features for creators, whether they be small businesses, advertisers, or people, so they can represent the most authentic version of themselves, connect with new communities, and leverage our advertising and creative solutions in a seamless way.We launched Promote to give our community a seamless way to turn their organic content on TikTok into ads, making it easier than ever to tap into new audiences. Today, we're introducing new targeting and boosting features to Promote to help the TikTok community drive traffic back to their profiles, turn viewers into potential leads, amplify their creator marketing budgets, and better target their desired audiences.Studies show that promoting organic content helps improve overall paid ad performance as ads perform better when people are first primed by organic content. (1) Seeing an organic TikTok video before a paid ad increases aided brand recall by 27% and branding on the ads gets attention 12% longer, found a recent study by Neurons. (2)Era Qirjo, owner of the ecommerce fashion brand Blanche Allure, used Promote to build brand awareness and reach new customers. Using Promote on her LIVE and product videos, Era saw a 30% lift in traffic and an increase in overall sales.

Highlights include:Drive views to their TikTok page: We have added a new Promote goal allowing Promote advertisers to drive traffic back to their TikTok page to help tell their brand's story or show off a range of products or services. With the \"more profile views\" goal, viewers will be presented with a call to action driving them directly to the advertisers TikTok profile.Spark deeper engagement with more messages: The new \"more messages\" Promote goal allows small businesses, who rely on interactions with customers to make their sales -- including service businesses, B2B brands, and businesses who take custom orders, to directly drive traffic to their TikTok inbox.Build brand love by boosting creators' content: For small businesses who work with creators, Promote now gives them the option to promote the creators' videos or LIVE videos to help increase views to their target audience. Creators can also use Promote for Others to give a boost to the content, creators and businesses they want the world to see.Get in front of the right audience with location targeting: We have expanded the audience targeting for Promote to include location as well as gender, age, and their interests, allowing small businesses with physical locations to directly target their local community. Now advertisers can either let TikTok pick the audience for them or create their own custom audience by choosing who they want to reach based on gender, age, their interests, and now location as well.We are committed to expanding our suite of features to empower advertisers of all sizes to grow and meet their goals, whether it's to build your audience on TikTok or engage with potential customers.

Our Community Guidelines establish and explain the behaviors and content that are not allowed on our platform, and when people violate our policies, we take action on their content and, when warranted, their account so we can keep our platform safe.Most of our community members aim to follow our policies, but there is a small minority of people who repeatedly violate our policies and don't change their behavior. Today, we're announcing an updated system for account enforcement to better act against repeat offenders. We believe that these changes will help us more efficiently and quickly remove harmful accounts, while promoting a clearer and more consistent experience for the vast majority of creators who want to follow our policies.Why we're updating the current account enforcement systemOur existing account enforcement system leverages different types of restrictions, like temporary bans from posting or commenting, to prevent abuse of our product features while teaching people about our policies in order to reduce future violations. While this approach has been effective in reducing harmful content overall, we've heard from creators that it can be confusing to navigate. We also know it can disproportionately impact creators who rarely and unknowingly violate a policy, while potentially being less efficient at deterring those who repeatedly violate them. Repeat violators tend to follow a pattern – our analysis has found that almost 90% violate using the same feature consistently, and over 75% violate the same policy category repeatedly. To better address this, we're updating our account enforcement system as we look to support our creator community and remove repeat offenders from our platform.How the streamlined account enforcement system will workUnder the new system, if someone posts content that violates one of our Community Guidelines, the account will accrue a strike as the content is removed. If an account meets the threshold of strikes within either a product feature (i.e. Comments, LIVE) or policy (i.e. Bullying and Harassment), it will be permanently banned. Those policy thresholds can vary depending on a violation's potential to cause harm to our community members – for example, there may be a stricter threshold for violating our policy against promoting hateful ideologies, than for sharing low-harm spam. We will continue to issue permanent bans on the first strike for severe violations, including promoting or threatening violence, showing or facilitating child sexual abuse material (CSAM), or showing real-world violence or torture. As an additional safeguard, accounts that accrue a high number of cumulative strikes across policies and features will also be permanently banned. Strikes will expire from an account's record after 90 days.Helping creators understand their account statusThese changes are intended to drive more transparency around our enforcement decisions and help our community better understand how to follow our Community Guidelines. To further support creators, over the coming weeks we'll also roll out new features in the Safety Center we provide to creators in app. These include an \"Account status\" page where creators can easily view the standing of their account, and a \"Report records\" page where creators can see the status of reports they've made on other content or accounts. These new tools add to the notifications creators already receive if they've violated our policies, and support creators' ability to appeal enforcements and have strikes removed if valid. We'll also begin notifying creators if they're on the verge of having their account permanently removed.Making consistent, transparent moderation decisionsAs a separate step toward improving transparency about our moderation practices at the content level, we are beginning to test a new feature in some markets that would provide creators with information about which of their videos have been marked as ineligible for recommendation to For You feeds, let them know why, and give them the opportunity to appeal.Our updated account enforcement system is currently rolling out globally, and we'll notify community members as this new system becomes available to them. We will continue evolving and sharing progress around the processes we use to evaluate accounts and assure accurate, nuanced enforcement decisions for accounts of all kinds across our platform."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/bhm-2023","date":"2023-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Visionary Voices: Celebrating #BlackTikTok","text":"From originating viral trends to elevating Black Joy through music, fashion, wellness and more, the #BlackTikTok community is at the forefront of culture and industry-shifting innovation.

For instance, labels are added to videos with unsubstantiated content. Blue check marks on accounts help viewers understand an account holder is who they say they are. Last year, we began to pilot adding labels on content from state-controlled media, starting in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Today we're expanding our global state-affiliated media policy and label to help viewers better understand sources behind content.Our approach to state-affiliated mediaOur state-affiliated media policy is to label accounts run by entities whose editorial output or decision-making process is subject to control or influence by a government. Our goal in labelling state-affiliated media is to ensure people have accurate, transparent, and actionable context when they engage with content from media accounts that may present the viewpoint of a government. We began our state-affiliated media pilot last year and have met with more than 60 media experts, political scientists, academics, and representatives from international organizations and civil society across North and South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. We also consulted our Content and Safety Advisory Councils and worked closely with a leading global media monitor to develop an independently-validated methodology to guide our state-affiliated media labelling decisions.The input we received from these stakeholders emphasized the importance of considering diverse political, legal and cultural contexts related to news media. In addition, we received feedback that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to state-affiliated media and supporting user education about the different ways that states seek to influence news and reporting is increasingly important. Based on this input, our policy considers state-controlled media, which we define as an entity where there is evidence of clear editorial control and decision-making by members of the state.How we assess editorial independence from statesIn evaluating editorial independence, we consider an organization's mission statement, editorial practices and safeguards, leadership and editorial governance, and its actual editorial decisions. We also apply additional scrutiny to entities that may be heavily reliant on state funding, either directly or through advertisements, loans, and subsidies. Some of the questions that we ask in categorizing include:Is editorial independence part of the organization's mission statement?Does the organization have a set of guidelines related to standards of journalistic conduct?Are there any state affiliations within management or editorial leadership positions?Has the organization transparently disclosed any state affiliations?Is there evidence of the media outlet not upholding its editorial guidelines?How has the entity handled issues of significant public interest regarding the government?Based on our evaluation, we will then categorize an entity and apply a label to the account's profile and to their content.Expanding our state-controlled media labelWe're expanding beyond our pilot and will begin applying our state-controlled media label in a phased approach, starting with over 40 markets across multiple regions. We'll continue to roll this label out to an even wider array of markets over time.Providing a path to appealWe've spent months developing an objective methodology that can be consistently applied by our trust and safety team who oversees state-affiliated media labeling decisions.

We've always had strict policies prohibiting nudity, sexual activity, and sexually explicit content, including content that directs to adult websites or apps. Over 40,000 dedicated trust and safety professionals work to develop and enforce these policies and build processes and technologies to detect, remove or restrict violative content at scale.We also have policies to make borderline or \"suggestive\" content ineligible for recommendation into TikTok For You feeds, and we're sharing some of the ongoing work underway to strengthen our enforcement of these policies. Our goal is to foster an appropriate experience for our community, and minors in particular.Enforcing our policies on sexually suggestive contentTo safeguard For You feeds, TikTok has policies around content categories that are not eligible for recommendation, including implied nudity, sensual content, and other content that is not suitable for all audiences over age 13. While technology is more advanced at detecting overt nudity, there will always be borderline content that is more challenging for our systems to identify. We continue to iterate on multiple approaches to enforce our policies in this area.Innovating on our Content Levels: Earlier this year we began to introduce our Content Levels system, which is designed to prevent certain content with more mature or complex themes (such as content containing profanity, adult innuendo, or sexually suggestive content) from reaching audiences between ages 13-17 (teen accounts). This is similar to other forms of media and platforms that use content ratings standards, except we've taken additional steps to help prevent teen accounts from viewing more mature content. As we've identified content as sexually suggestive or explicit, we've prevented teen accounts from viewing over 1 million overtly sexually suggestive videos in the last 30 days alone.Investing in automation: Over the last year we've been iterating on our machine learning models to improve their consistency and accuracy in detecting sexually explicit, suggestive, or borderline content. Our aim is to quickly identify and remove violative content from our platform and prevent borderline or suggestive content from being recommended to or searchable by teen accounts. We're making progress to reduce the prevalence of borderline or suggestive content recommendations overall, and are now launching the next iteration of our borderline suggestive model which we expect to improve detection of such content, therefore creating a more appropriate and comfortable experience for teen account holders.Partnering across the industry: We recently partnered with StopNCII.org, joining forces with Meta and Bumble, to bolster efforts to stop the spread of non-consensual intimate imagery. Not only will this collaboration provide better support for victims, it will also help automatically prevent content identified through our partnership with StopNCII from being posted on our platform.Empowering creators: We want to empower creators to direct their content to the most appropriate audience. That's why we rolled out audience controls as a way for creators to restrict their content to accounts over 18 in LIVE earlier this year. We've started to bring our audience controls feature to creators of short-form video and will expand the feature globally over the coming weeks. To be clear: our policies still fully apply to creators who use this feature, and we will remove content which contains nudity and other violations of our Community Guidelines. We regularly educate creators about our policies because it takes a village to create a space where everyone feels welcome and safe.Our goal has always been to make sure our community, especially teens on our platform, have a safe, positive and joyful experience when they come to TikTok. We've already taken significant strides to help ensure their feeds are full of content that is appropriate for them, and these improvements mark an important next step to meet that goal."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/learn-why-a-video-is-recommended-for-you","date":"2022-12-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"Learn why a video is recommended For You","text":"At TikTok, we want people to feel empowered creating, connecting, and engaging on our platform. That's why we equip creators and viewers with a range of features, tools, and resources so they can stay in control of their experience. Today we're adding to that toolbox with a feature that helps bring more context to content recommended in For You feeds.See why content is recommended for youTikTok For You feeds enable people to discover an incredible diversity of ideas, creators, products, and entertainment. Our system recommends content by ranking videos based on a combination of factors based on your activity on our app, which includes adjusting for things you indicate you're not interested in. Our goal is to serve a range of relevant and entertaining content. To help people understand why a particular video has been recommended to them, we're rolling out a new tool over the coming weeks. Here's how it works:In your For You feed, tap on the share panel.Then, tap the question mark icon called \"Why this video\"From there, you can see reasons why a particular video was recommended to you.Our recommendation system is powered by technical models, so we tried to make the technical details more easily understandable by breaking down reasons like:user interactions, such as content you watch, like or share, comments you post, or searchesaccounts you follow or suggested accounts for youcontent posted recently in your regionpopular content in your regionThis feature is one of many ways we're working to bring meaningful transparency to the people who use our platform, and builds on a number of steps we've taken towards that goal. For instance, we publish guidelines for content categories that are ineligible for recommendation, tools to help customize recommendations, and educational resources that explain how our content recommendations work. Looking ahead, we'll continue to expand this feature to bring more granularity and transparency to content recommendations."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/whats-next-2023-trend-report","date":"2022-12-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"What's Next 2023 Trend Report","text":"Throughout the last 12 months, the global TikTok community reimagined entertainment. They shared real, personal stories that brought communities together and helped others discover new ways of thinking. Brands of all sizes across the globe - from #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt favorites to global car manufacturers - have created all kinds of content on TikTok to engage their communities.Today we're launching the TikTok What's Next Report 2023, our third annual trend forecast, designed to help marketers understand how consumers' wants and needs will change in the upcoming year and what that will mean for their strategies, both on and off of TikTok.From fun to functional, this new report will focus on unpacking long-term TikTok-first cultural forces, the underlying signals that show how each of these come to life, and the implications for brands to succeed on the platform.Sofia Hernandez, Global Head of Business Marketing for TikTok said: \"2022 was the year people realized they didn't have to live their lives as they always have done - with different points of view and ideas transcending cultures on TikTok. Next year we're going to see more of this - as our communities get more confident and inspire positive change together. Against the backdrop of the increasing cost of living and its associated challenges, our What's Next report indicates people will be seeking new ways to achieve success, happiness and wellbeing - and TikTok will be a tool to help them find it.\"You can view the full global 'What's Next' report here.Its findings are consolidated into three forces - large-scale transformations that demonstrate how TikTok is shaping culture - and the relevant signals for each of these forces that show emerging behaviors and interests across vertical sectors. Based on research and behaviors we've seen on TikTok, we predict there will be three major trend forces underscoring this change:Actionable EntertainmentMaking Space for JoyCommunity-Built IdealsActionable EntertainmentOn TikTok, content is curated based on what communities find entertaining - in fact 4 in 5 users say TikTok is very or extremely entertaining(1). This means that when advertising messaging is delivered like an ad, but loved like entertainment, brands can see incredible business results.In the US, e.l.f. Cosmetics tapped into the power of actionable entertainment and captured the community's attention with in-feed advertisements that felt fun, engaging, and native to the TikTok community. Working alongside their agency and TikTok marketing partner Tinuiti, e.l.f Cosmetics effectively doubled spending month-over-month and dropped acquisition costs for their add-to-cart strategy by 56%.For brands, the most effective messages on TikTok are uplifting, funny and personalized, or entertaining their audiences. Brands can build on this entertainment value by using editing techniques like syncing sounds to transitions or adding text overlays - which are effective at keeping viewers' attention.Making Space for JoyThere's no shortage of self-care advice and initiatives out there, yet people are still burning out. So they're seeking meaningful self-care amidst an endless cycle of public health issues, burnout at work and personal hardships.TikTok fosters endless opportunities to spread joy, and among TikTok users who took an action off-platform as a result of TikTok, 90% said the platform makes them happy and never gets boring(2). This is key for brands looking to make more meaningful connections with their audiences. In 2023, messaging on TikTok - and beyond - should align with the community's desire for levity, and empower them to make more room for joy in their lives.Whether it's the growth of meme culture - providing a language for people to bond over humor; people sharing wellbeing \"life hacks\" - every day strategies that empower people to make space for themselves whenever they need; or a creator highlighting how they reward themselves at any budget level, people are dedicating space and time for joy in the way the best suits them.EA Games captured this brilliantly in a recent campaign that rose awareness of their in-game Sims Sessions concert series. The campaign invited users to make videos that put their own creative spin on singing in the game's native, iconic Simlish language. The result was a uniquely fun opportunity that mobilized passionate gamers to share organic content and attract new interest to The Sims. You can learn more about the campaign by watching out TikTok Made Me Play It gaming summit here.Creating TikTok content that helps people carve out joy for themselves - or even provides joy through humor, relaxation and relatable points of view - could be the difference for brands in 2023.Community-Built IdealsTikTok communities are a cut above the rest because they're specific - and that's what helps them thrive at scale. Sharing hyper-niche interests helps people bond with each other. From there, they broaden each other's horizons.TikTok is not a town hall meeting. It's a collection of tiny clubs where people can find new ideas on how to explore their passions and live their lives. In fact, TikTok is 1.8x more likely to introduce people to new topics they didn't know they liked compared to traditional social platforms(1). And as people seek out ways to break the status quo, they'll look to peers and role models who demonstrate the confidence to live life the way they want to.People use TikTok to start conversations in their community and find unique answers to satisfy their every curiosity. And it's not just about learning and aspiration. It's about individuals from around the world coming together to build a likeminded community built on shared ideals and interests, and the inspiration that comes from them.eBay leaned into this by cultivating a strong following with sneaker-heads as the ultimate destination for buying and selling the coolest shoes. eBay partnered with TikTok to leverage Voting Stickers to ask the TikTok community directly to show love for their favorite shoe in their annual #SneakerShowdown. eBay's #SneakerShowdown drove engagement by encouraging interactivity with the Voting Stickers, and users showed up. 1.2 million users participated in the poll, and the campaign delivered a +54% lift in comment rate.The #SneakerTok community - which sports over 1.1B views globally(4) - is just one example that underlines the value and engagement of how people come together on TikTok. And creators play a big role in community-building and pioneering creative content; after watching creator content, more than 2 in 5 people on TikTok agreed that it made them feel like a part of the brand's community(3). To connect with viewers, brands should tap into niches and not be afraid to get specific. Once a brand understands its key groups, it can then amplify the voices that define them and augment those honest, authentic conversations that people care about.A note on What's Next MethodologyTikTok For Business compiled comprehensive insights from a variety of sources to better understand small, medium and large-scale TikTok trends and what they can tell us about culture and creativity on the platform.

From working out with mom to cooking with dad—we're inspired to see so many teens and their parents using TikTok to make memories, discover new interests, and have fun. Our platform offers a space for families to create and enjoy authentic moments, and we are committed to fostering important conversations that allow this enjoyment to take place safely and responsibly.We understand that each family is different, with diverse needs and practices. That's why we partnered with ConnectSafely to survey US parents to better understand how they approach discussions about online safety with their teens. The results show that parents recognize how important these conversations are, which is why TikTok is launching initiatives to equip and empower parents to support these critical conversations with their teens.Understanding parents' approach to safety conversationsWe commissioned YouGov to survey over 2,000 US parents of 13 to 17 year olds to help us better understand the different ways they tackle conversations about online safety and well-being with their teens. We sought to identify how often parents talk with their teens about online experiences, how comfortable they are discussing safety topics, and which safety measures they employ in their own households.There's no question that these conversations are vital—in fact, 78% of parents surveyed believe that parents have the biggest responsibility to talk to teens about online safety, compared to social media platforms (7%), friends (6%), and teachers (3%). But how and when are parents leading these conversations with their teens?The findings reveal that parents may hesitate to proactively and consistently initiate these conversations. Over half (61%) of parents talk with their teens about online safety after their teens encounter a problem and come to them about it, with nearly the same amount (58%) doing so when they see a negative change in the mood or habits of their teens. While a significant majority of parents (94%) report feeling confident about speaking with their teens about their social media use, only a third (33%) reported speaking with their teens about their use of online and social media platforms on a weekly basis. The findings show that while parents want ownership and believe in their ability to speak to their teens about online safety, they often hesitate to proactively initiate conversations.The findings also reveal emerging trends on how parents approach safety conversations within their families:For moms, the safety topic they report discussing most often with their teens centered around bullying and harassment (60%) and scams/fraud (60%), while dads speak to their teens most often about screen time (49%).While over two-thirds (68%) of moms and half (50%) of dads feel very confident talking to their teens about body image, these conversations are mostly directed to their daughters (45%) versus their sons (28%).The top reasons moms gave for avoiding conversations around body image with their teens is their belief that that their teens would not want them to talk about it and that the subject is covered sufficiently in school (42%). While dads cite their belief that their teens would not want them to talk about it (41%) and fear that they'd make matters worse (32%).Moms are more likely than dads to have the passcode for their teens' phones, follow their teens on online platforms, and to ask their teens to show them their social media profiles and feeds.Based on the findings and the responses parents gave to questions about their own online presence and the steps they take to support their teens' online experience, we identified three distinct digital parenting practices:Confident Caregivers are parents who have their own online presence and are generally confident initiating conversations with their teens about online experiences.Aware Advocates know the apps their teens use, but feel slightly reluctant and under-prepared to initiate conversations about online safety and wellbeing with their teens.Sideline Supporters aren't as active online, and avoid initiating conversations with their teens about being online.Reaching parents where they areWe want to empower more parents to feel like Confident Caregivers when it comes to having conversations about online safety. Our research shows that 82% of parents think it's important for them to spend time using the same online platforms as their teens to better understand or facilitate conversations about their experience on that platform. And while 86% of parents said they have an awareness of TikTok's safety tools and features, including Family Pairing; only 57% of parents reported using these features. We want to increase parents' usage of our safety tools, especially for those Aware Advocates and Sidelines Supporters, which is why we've launched several initiatives to help raise awareness about how to use our Family Pairing feature, including community events with families, in-app educational content, and a national and local TV campaign.Family Pairing allows parents and guardians to link their accounts with those of their teens and set a variety of privacy and safety controls, such as managing screen time limits, setting a teen's account to private, and deciding who can comment on their videos. One way we're raising awareness about this feature and how it can be used to facilitate productive discussions with teens is through in-person events with National PTA. We know that teens want to be part of the conversations about how they can be safe and responsible online, and we feel it's important to recognize and incorporate their voices. To that end, we're visiting schools in Austin, Albany, and Seattle to hear directly from teens and parents about their online experiences, conduct panels featuring high school students, and host peer-to-peer breakout sessions for teens and adults based on our Create with Kindness program.Parents, who are our greatest allies in promoting safe and responsible online experiences, are savvy social media users themselves, with over three-quarters (77%) of them having a presence on at least one online or social media platform. To that end, we've also launched in-app educational videos featuring beloved TikTok family creators like @billyvsco, @team2moms, and @handsonfamily, who've created tutorials on TikTok that offer tips on how to foster an open dialogue with your teens. Additionally, we've launched a national and local TV campaign to reach parents and families in cities across the country with useful tips and conversation starters for parents who want to feel better equipped to initiate proactive conversations with their teens on these topics.Building a safe and responsible platformWe recognize that adolescence is an important phase for teens, as this is a time when they're exploring the world around them and beginning to define their own identities both online and offline. From our policies to our features, this phase of adolescent development is at the forefront of our minds to ensure the experience of teens on TikTok is entertaining and enriching, which is why we're launching a tool to help them reflect on the time they spend online. After spending a certain amount of time on TikTok, teens will now see a prompt on their feed that shows an overview of the time they have spent on TikTok and encourages them to check out our screen time management tools. This proactive, in-prompt prompt will continue once a week until teens review the screen time features available to them or reduce their screen time to under 100 minutes each day.We want TikTok to play a positive role in the lives of teens on our platform, and we recognize that this is made possible by partnering with parents. We know that parents care deeply about the safety and well-being of their teens. While the majority of parents believe they have the biggest responsibility to talk to teens about online safety, but we want to do our part, too. From our Community Guidelines to our work with experts—such as ConnectSafely and National PTA—we are building age-appropriate experiences that acknowledge teens' unique needs. This work never ends, and we're committed to continuing to seek guidance from experts, parents, and teens as we build towards a future that protects, uplifts, and nurtures teens and families on TikTok.Larry Magid, ConnectSafely President & CEO: \"ConnectSafely is pleased to partner with TikTok on this important research. It's reassuring to learn that 78% of parents recognize they have the biggest responsibility to talk to their teens about online safety and gratifying to see that 82% of parents agree with ConnectSafely about the importance of spending time using the same online platforms as their teens to better understand or facilitate conversations. Overall, the survey shows that most parents already take their role seriously when it comes to supervising their teens' online activities, but there is still work to be done to help and encourage even more parents to gain the confidence they need to speak with their teens about social media use.\""},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-american-express-shop-small-accelerator","date":"2022-11-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"Shop Small® to Create Big Impact","text":"By Sofia Hernandez, Global Head of Business Marketing Every day, the people behind small businesses turn to TikTok to take us inside their world.

Revolutionizing global music collaboration, StemDrop will act as an incubator for new talent, artistry, and creativity by giving the opportunity for all artists and music creators, from anywhere in the world, the opportunity to collaborate with some of the very best and most iconic songwriting talents of all time.Made possible by Samsung, there will also be a first of its kind 'StemDrop Mixer' on TikTok where creators of all levels can experiment with individual effects, harmonies and melodies to create and upload their own unique version of the song.Officially launching on 26 October on TikTok, with creative direction from Syco Entertainment and Universal Music Group’s Republic Records and powered by Samsung Galaxy. StemDrop is a never-before-seen platform for artists to showcase their talent to the world.Max Martin, the prolific producer and songwriter, has produced dozens of the greatest and best known Billboard number 1 singles over the last two decades, including Britney Spears’ “...Baby One More Time”, Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way”, Céline Dion’s “That’s the Way It is”, Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” and The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights”.Fuelled by their passion to collaborate, the multiple Grammy-Award winning songwriters Max Martin, Savan Kotecha (One Direction, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, Christina Aguilera, The Weeknd) and Ali Payami (Taylor Swift, The Weeknd) are releasing a version of their brand-new single for the first StemDrop, kicking-off this new generation of global music collaboration.TikTok's community of over one billion users continues to push culture forward and at the heart of TikTok is the belief that anyone can take a sound, creative idea, trend or cultural moment and flip it to collaborate with others and create something entirely original, entertaining and engaging.On October 26, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ali Payami will release 60-seconds of a brand new single exclusively on TikTok.

With tens of thousands of songs uploaded every day this idea will give aspiring artists the opportunity to collaborate with some of the most successful songwriters in the world. The premise was always very straightforward… ‘What would happen if the best songwriters in the world wrote a song for the world…….?’ We have no idea what’s going to happen. I do know there are so many incredibly talented people who are trying to stand out and I hope and believe this could make a big difference to their careers. It says everything about Max Martin, Savan and Ali that they have decided to give this song to the TikTok community to record and collaborate with them. And I want to thank them so much for believing in this idea. In addition, I want to thank TikTok, Samsung and Universal for their support and enthusiasm. Again, their passionate support of talented people is amazing.”StemDrop co-creator Tim Van Rongen said “I’m thrilled to be part of the next step in talent discovery. I feel it’s the exact right moment to launch a music project where the creative process is fully in the hands of the creators on TikTok.

TikTok LIVE brings people together through content that entertains and inspires, providing creators an opportunity to show up as their most authentic selves as they forge meaningful connections and share a window into their lives with a global community - all in real time.Whether just getting started, or looking to try out a new feature, we want to ensure creators feel excited and ready to go LIVE with a few best practices and tips, along with our latest product and policy updates.Go LIVE together with Multi-Guest:To make way for more meaningful connections with audiences, we've recently upgraded our Multi-Guest feature. Through Multi-Guest, hosts can now go LIVE with up to 5 guests using a grid or panel layout, keeping audiences engaged as they respond to questions, host how-to videos, or simply share a moment together with the community. And once LIVE, creators can tap the three dots to change a variety of settings. This includes the ability to flip the camera, add effects and stickers, filter comments, and add moderators if they haven't already been assigned.Our ongoing work to help keep our community safeThe foundation of TikTok is built on community trust and safety. To protect our users and creators and support their well-being, we constantly work to evolve the safeguards we put in place. Today, we're making additional changes and improvements to help our community have the best experience possible when they use LIVE.Currently, people must be aged 16 or over to host a LIVE. From November 23, the minimum age will increase from 16 to 18. As we consider the breadth of our global audience, we already take a graduated approach to the features that our community can access based on their age; younger teens need to be aged 16 or older to access Direct Messaging and 18 or older to send virtual gifts or access monetization features.In addition, in the coming weeks, we plan to introduce a new way for creators to choose if they'd prefer to only reach an adult audience in their LIVE. For instance, perhaps a comedy routine is better suited for people over age 18. Or, a host may plan to talk about a difficult life experience and they would feel more comfortable knowing the conversation is limited to adults. We want our community to make the most of the opportunities LIVE can bring without compromising on safety. We believe these industry-leading updates can further protect the younger members of our community as they start and build their online presence. Introducing safety reminders for LIVE creatorsTo help creators focus on entertaining and engaging their viewers, LIVE creators can already use our keyword filtering tool to limit comments they feel aren't appropriate. In the coming weeks, we're rolling out an updated version of this feature that will send a reminder to people and suggest new keywords they may want to consider adding to their filter list. To do this, the tool looks at the content a creator most commonly removes from their LIVE, spotting similar words in these comments and then suggesting the host may want to add these words to their filter list. When we tested this feature, we found that it nearly doubled those using keyword filtering when looking at the most popular LIVE creators.As always, we have a suite of safety features to help people stay in control throughout their live streaming and troubleshoot problems as they come up. We have a vibrant and inspiring community on TikTok, and it's important that our platform remains a safe, supportive, and joyful place for our community.More information on TikTok LIVE safety tools can be found here, and visit the TikTok Safety Center for additional information on our safety policies and tools.A word from some of our creators about how they use LIVE safety features"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-thenoezepeda","date":"2022-10-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @thenoezepeda","text":"Noe Zepeda creates content that represents both his Latino and LGBTQ+ identities. On TikTok, he has continued to pursue his love for acting — including creating and starring in his own Telenovela on the platform, and coining the term #TikTokNovela.What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?I am proud of my background and roots, so it means a lot to be a part of the Latinx community. I hope to be an inspiration for young Latin boys and girls who do not feel like they have equal opportunities because they pertain to a minority group, teaching them that no dream is too big!How do you share your culture on TikTok?I share my culture on TikTok by creating Latin telenovelas, which I grew up loving. I hope to continue sharing my love for telenovelas with future generations!What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?I love all of my telenovela episodes, but this one, in particular, is my favorite because I always wanted to create my own romantic scene where the characters meet for the first time.What inspired you to start your novella series on TikTok?I loved watching telenovelas growing up. Telenovelas have been losing steam due to the rollout of streaming services. I thought it was important to give new life to the genre I grew up watching by presenting my series to the new generation. I'm proud to have created a community where people can discuss this type of television genre.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?My passion on and off TikTok is to promote the prevention of bullying, which is my current day job working in my school district. I like working with children and teaching them that bullying is not cool. Instead, it's better to uplift one another and share kindness.What advice would you give someone trying to create comedy content on TikTok?This might sound cliche, but stay true to yourself. Everyone might think copying someone else's success will generate a following, but that's not true. If you're promoting content that you genuinely love, others will relate. For example, I love acting. From putting on wigs to creating new characters, I get to be creative, and although it's hard work, it's work that I love and resonates with my community. So, my best advice is to be true to yourself and do what you love; then you'll see success."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-world-2022","date":"2022-10-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"TikTok World: Building for the future of entertainment and advertising","text":"Today, we're kicking off TikTok World, marking our second global product summit for brands to connect, co-create, and thrive with the TikTok community.

Brands have become a core part of this entertainment experience by embracing storytelling, community, and creativity.As we build for the next era of advertising, we're excited to unveil new solutions and research at this year's TikTok World that give brands and marketers the tools to reimagine engagement with the TikTok community and deliver real impact for businesses of all sizes.Like other TikTok features, our ad products are designed to enhance the experience of the TikTok community, inspire creativity, and bring joy.

Here are the highlights from TikTok World.Supercharging brand growth with authentic creativity only found on TikTokOn TikTok, creativity delivers performance. Through a study with Hotspex, we learned 71% of the TikTok community says that it's a creator's authenticity that motivates them to buy from a brand (5). Our recent study with Kantar shows that working with creators to produce TikTok creatives will have a higher chance of gaining a significant brand lift and doubling engagement rate and watch time (6). As we continue working with our community of creators, partners, and users, we're committed to building solutions that bring even more creators into the ecosystem, making it easier for brands and creators to work together.As the official platform for branded content collaborations on TikTok, TikTok Creator Marketplace (TTCM) connects brands and agencies with over 800,000 qualified creators around the world. We're now introducing several updates to TTCM that will enable brands to find creators more efficiently, activate creators at scale, and measure and optimize campaign performance.With improved search capability and integrations of a brand's campaign insights, TTCM now provides better creator-matching results with precise and granular keyword searches.TTCM Match, a new recommendation functionality, can automatically generate lists of creators based on a brand's brief in under 10 seconds.Open Application Campaigns, available by invite-only in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia , allows brands to post details of an upcoming campaign on the TTCM platform for creators to proactively apply.Invite Links allow any brand or any agency to work with ANY* creator, even those not enrolled into TTCM.

We've partnered with Linktree on the first Profile Kit integration, empowering creators to showcase their TikTok content directly on their Linktree page, with additional options to engage and encourage audiences to navigate to their TikTok profile.Engage your audience with a new campaign objective: Focused ViewWhat truly sets TikTok apart is the high level of engagement and attention. TikTok is an immersive, full-screen, and sound-on experience, where people give their undivided attention. Not only do they spend more time watching TikTok every day, but they are also more engaged on TikTok than any other platform. 46% of users engage with content on TikTok without distractions or multi-screening (7). Engagement is TikTok's superpower and an opportunity for brands.To help brands stay focused and drive impact, we're introducing Focused View. Focused View is the next generation of our current Video View campaign objective on TikTok Ads Manager. With Focused View, brands only pay when users have voluntarily watched an ad for at least 6 seconds or when they interacted with the ad within the first 6 seconds (whichever comes first). This means that ads are shown to users who are truly paying attention and voluntarily engaging with the brand.Focused View has delivered amazing results during the testing stage with our global brand partners. In an ever-changing digital marketing world where returns on ad spend are increasingly valued, Focused View offers a way for brands to engage with their audiences more effectively and cost-efficiently.Closing the deal with solutions tailored for your audiencesCommunities are the new demographics on TikTok.

She enjoys experimenting with food and adding a special twist to her traditional recipes for the new generation to enjoy.What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?Being part of the Latinx community means showing my kids where we come from — our culture and our traditions. It also means fostering community with my family, friends, neighbors and fellow creators. No matter which country our families come from, all Latinos share a common bond and a mutual respect for each other. Whether you call a food a Mexican Gordita, a Colombian Arpea or a Salvadorian Pupusa, we all share so much in common, and it’s exciting and inspiring to find those nuances that make us similar but different.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community inspired me to dive deeper into my heritage and roots by learning about where the Latinx community comes from. I’ve always been interested in history and storytelling, both of which flow seamlessly into my passion for sharing traditional recipes in my TikTok content. I’m able to bring my modern palate and cultural background into the kitchen to put something truly fresh on the table.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?My favorite videos to make are my aguas frescas. I used to make this drink for my grandma in Mexico. She and I would always be creative with the fruit my dad would bring home, and we'd love watching him guess the ingredients in the drinks and seeing his reaction. He still loves to guess to this day.What is your favorite recipe that you've ever created for TikTok?I don't have a favorite, only because I'm a foodie. I love all kinds of food. Though right now, I really love my big papa burritos and my chile relleno burgers.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?My family is my top priority, but I love gardening when I’m not hanging out with my kids or making videos in the kitchen. I’m into grafting plants and trees to try and fuse different fruits and vegetables together. One of my biggest successes was a mega-citrus combination of lemon, lime, and orange! I’m also big into growing plants from seeds. As a chef, it’s very important to have fresh ingredients available at home as often as possible.What is the most fun, unexpected thing that's happened ever since you got started on TikTok?I've been given amazing opportunities because of TikTok, and I've met incredible co-creators with similar interests. I met Lizzo and received an invitation to see Rachael Ray. I've traveled to Texas, a place I've wanted to go to!

Sometimes this joy comes from therapeutic or heartwarming content, such as guided meditations or family yoga videos. And at other times, this happiness stems from the realization that you are not alone because others share and empathize with the feelings and challenges you're going through. We want our platform to continue to be a place where people feel safe and welcome—no matter where they are on their journeys.We recognize that everyone one has a unique and personal experience with mental health. To improve our understanding of our community's feelings and mental health journeys, we conducted a global survey in partnership with market research firm YouGov. The goal of our research was to explore cross-generational attitudes toward well-being, including their comfort levels in talking about these issues with families, friends, and others. We were encouraged to find that nearly 9 in 10 believe their mental well-being is either as important or more important than their physical well-being, affirming our commitment to cultivating a safe and supportive environment for our community to share their mental health journeys.We also sought to learn about the support people want when choosing to share their experience online and how our community chooses to discuss difficult topics and struggles. Our research uncovered that 8 in 10 US adults feel comfortable talking about their mental well-being. However, the figures decrease with each generation that follows, with people ages 18-24 reporting the highest levels of discomfort in talking about mental well-being. In fact, almost half of 18-24-year-olds in the US believe that their friends and family would judge them if they talked about their mental well-being — 12 points higher than the average American (36%). We believe that de-stigmatizing mental well-being discussions, especially amongst the younger generations, is crucial to decreasing these fears about judgement.Approaching these conversations with the care and compassion they deserve can seem daunting, but interestingly, respondents feel comfortable listening to others speak about their own mental health. Nearly half of the people surveyed feel comfortable listening to others' conversations about their mental well-being. Each day on the platform we see how a thoughtful video or check-in from even a stranger can be transformative for others—these videos from creators talking about their own struggles may help the TikTok community feel seen and encourage fruitful conversations.To further nurture TikTok's environment of empathy and understanding, we brought together some of our community's favorite creators with mental health experts to empower them to create responsible content around mental well-being. These creators learned how to talk about sensitive issues, like grief and eating disorder recovery, to build a better understanding around creating content on sensitive topics of mental well-being. Our hope is that as our community listens more to these conversations and develops a vocabulary and understanding of mental health topics, they are able to begin talking about mental health in their own lives.Another one of the ways we're working to de-stigmatize mental well-being discussion is by supporting empathetic conversations around it. Last month, we launched a global campaign, \"Mental Well-Being Comes First,\" to help bring awareness to the importance of mental well-being through dedicated in-app programming, including LIVEs, effects, and stickers. Our aim is to maintain a supportive environment for people who choose to share their experiences with their well-being. And for those who would like to learn more, we've launched themed hashtags to foster conversation and understanding:#MentalHealth - for heartfelt discussions about personal journeys with mental well-being.#SelfCare - for tips on how to prioritize actions that bring greater peace.#StressRelief - for help with relaxation.#HealingJourney - for candid conversations on the many ways healing can take place.#WeDoRecover - for encouraging stories about persevering through difficult times.We strive to navigate the complexity of supporting our community's well-being on our platform with nuance. We take a two-pronged approach that involves removing harmful content and connecting people to resources. Our Community Guidelines do not allow content that depicts, promotes, or normalizes activities that could lead to suicide, self-harm, or disordered eating.The survey we conducted revealed that one-quarter of people feel that they would feel more comfortable talking about their mental well-being if they had access to well-being tools and resources from online platforms. We also see that people value having access to good information from experts and organizations, with 2 in 3 respondents citing doctors and mental health professionals as their top sources for help with their mental well-being. With that knowledge, we've developed resources available throughout our app that will direct people to local experts or support, as they engage with mental well-being content.We are always looking for ways to better understand and best support our TikTok community. We are excited about the steps we're taking to promote mental well-being, but it does not stop here—we will continue to dive into how to promote fruitful conversation and provide our community with the resources they need to flourish on and off our platform.MethodologyGlobal Consumer Attitudes on Mental Well-being is a survey conducted by YouGov among 16,000 adult consumers across 13 markets (United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Germany, South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, Canada, Brazil, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Egypt), commissioned by TikTok in September 2022."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/happy-tiktokhalloween","date":"2022-10-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Happy #TikTokHalloween!","text":"With floating jack-o-lanterns, haunting folklore, ghoulish makeup, candy apple recipes, and so much more, billions of people across the world turn to #TikTokHalloween to share and connect over the spookiest season of the year.

Celebrating our 2-year anniversary with the ethical hacker communityEarlier this year, TikTok became a founding sponsor of HackerOne's Corporate Security Responsibility (CSecR) pledge, honoring transparency, collaboration, innovation, and differentiation as core principles to help create a safer digital world for everyone. The pledge furthers the commitments we made two years ago when launching our Global Bug Bounty program. Since its inception, we've awarded over $585,000 in bug bounties to over 250 ethical hackers for responsibly identifying and disclosing over 450 vulnerabilities so we could quickly resolve them. The program continues to attract new hackers thanks to our comprehensive scope and commitment to transparency.As of October 1, this year's top contributors are:s3c: Yusuf is a 23-year-old bug bounty hunter from Kurdistan, Iraq, claiming his spot as one of TikTok's top contributors for the second consecutive year!

My father and I have not been back since before COVID, and we are the only two in the family who live in the US.

I would love to share how those products and experiences vary across airlines – similar to Netflix’s “World's Most Amazing Vacation Rentals” or “Amazing Hotels.” This show will focus on the premium flight products of airlines. I want to attract a global audience with viewers planning a special once-in-a-lifetime trip, frequent flyers and those who like seeing the world's best flights. I also want to show that it is not just old, white men sitting in those seats; minority women belong too, and sharing these experiences would help demystify premium flying for the rest of the flying public!Where is your favorite travel destination and why?My favorite travel destination is Mexico because you have access to a breadth of experiences, from the ocean, city to the deserts.

To help keep our platform welcoming and authentic for everyone, we remove content which violates our policies. We aim to be transparent about those removals with creators and through our Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports. Our next report for April-June, published today, shows improvements made in countering misinformation and we want to provide insight on the work that led to these gains.Misinformation is not a new problem, but the internet provides a new avenue to an old challenge. We recognize the impact misinformation can have in eroding trust in public health, electoral processes, facts, and science. We are committed to being part of the solution. We treat misinformation with the utmost seriousness and take a multi-pronged approach to stopping it from spreading, while elevating authoritative information and investing in digital literacy education to help get ahead of the problem at scale.Our policiesOur integrity policies aim to promote a trustworthy, authentic experience. Within those, our harmful misinformation policies prohibit content that could mislead our community about civic processes, public health, or safety. For instance, we do not allow medical misinformation about vaccines or abortion, and we do not allow misinformation about voting. These policies can be applied to a wide range of content, and that's by design; this content is constantly changing, often based on what's happening in the world.In addition to removing content that is inaccurate and harms our users or community, we also remove accounts that seek to mislead people or use TikTok to deceptively sway public opinion. These activities range from inauthentic or fake account creation, to more sophisticated efforts to undermine public trust. These actors never stop evolving their tactics, and we continually seek to strengthen our policies as we detect new types of content and behaviors.Enforcing our policiesAt TikTok, a combination of technology and thousands of safety professionals work together to enforce our Community Guidelines. To do this effectively at scale, we continue to invest in technology-based flagging as well as moderation. We rely on automated moderation when our systems have a high degree of confidence that content is violative so that we can expeditiously remove violations of our policies.However, misinformation is different than other content issues. Context and fact-checking are critical to consistently and accurately enforcing our misinformation policies. So while we use machine learning models to help detect potential misinformation, ultimately our approach today is having our moderation team assess, confirm, and remove misinformation violations. We have specialized misinformation moderators who have enhanced training, expertise, and tools to take action on misinformation. This includes direct access to our fact-checking partners who help assess the accuracy of content.We have more than a dozen fact-checking partners around the world that review content in over 30 languages. All of our fact-checking partners are accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network as verified signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network's code of principles. Out of an abundance of caution, while content is being fact-checked or when content can't be substantiated through fact-checking, it becomes ineligible for recommendation into For You feeds. If fact-checkers confirm content to be false, we may remove the video from our platform or make the video ineligible for recommendation into For You feeds.To continually improve detecting and removing misinformation, we've made some key investments this year, including:continued investment in machine learning models and increased capacity to iterate on these models rapidly given the fast changing nature of misinformation.improved detection of known misleading audio and imagery to reduce manipulated content.a database of previously fact-checked claims to help misinformation moderators make swift and accurate decisions.a proactive detection program with our fact-checkers who flag new and evolving claims they're seeing across the internet. This allows us to look for these claims on our platform and remove violations. Since starting this program last quarter, we identified 33 new misinformation claims, resulting in the removal of 58,000 videos from the platform.While violations of our integrity and authenticity policies make up less than 1% of overall video removals, these continued investments have brought gains to our proactive detection and enforcement of these policies.Collaborating with othersWe firmly believe collaborating with experts is key to tackling this challenge. We regularly engage with our Content Advisory Council, researchers, civil society organizations, and media literacy experts. Not only does this collaboration help strengthen our policies and overall knowledge of trends and issues, it also enables us to elevate authoritative voices in our app. For instance, we created a digital literacy hub in our app with content aimed at equipping people with skills to evaluate content they consume, featuring content from experts at MediaWise and the National Association of Media Literacy Education. To promote election integrity, we create Elections Centers to provide access to authoritative information about voting and local elections from organizations like the National Association of Secretaries of State and Ballotpedia. To support public health, people can access information about COVID-19 and monkeypox from the World Health Organization through hashtag PSAs and labels on videos.We will continue to iterate on how we tackle this challenge, and we know our work will never be finished.

There are countless creators in the art community where you can find inspiration. I get a lot of my personal inspiration on TikTok, and I think the trends we're seeing now are timeless."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-curlsbydaviana","date":"2022-09-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @curlsbydaviana","text":"Daviana Mercedes believes that hair is a big part of people’s identities. Throughout her more than six-year natural hair journey, she has acquired the skills and knowledge to show people of color how to care for and love their textured hair.What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?When I think of 'Latinx', I immediately think about independence and diligence. That's what this community is all about. We are hard workers and have persevered through all of life's obstacles. Being Afro-Latina is everything to me. I am a first-generation Latina and the first in my family to graduate from college. Being 'the first' in so many areas of my life has shown me that nothing would be possible without the sacrifices of those that came before me. I'm forever humbled to be a part of this trailblazing community!How has the TikTok community inspired you?I'm so grateful that TikTok allows me to share natural hair education with the world. As a Latina who grew up hearing that curly hair was \"pelo malo,\" changing this narrative and helping others love their own crowns is a huge deal to me. On TikTok, I have so many people rooting for me and looking forward to my content, which has helped get me through tough times. My community inspired me to get my hair license in 2023 with the hopes of creating curly hair salons that will be able to help even more people.How do you share your culture on TikTok?When people go on my profile, the first thing they see is I am an Afro-Latina creator. It's the first thing in my bio, and something I don't shy away from in my Spanglish content. As my platform continues to grow, it's been a priority of mine to be loud and proud of my culture. I want people to know that Afro-Latina's exist!Natural hair is still not widely accepted within the Latinx community. I try to break the stereotype that \"curly hair is ugly\" by sharing and simplifying my hair journey on TikTok. Whether that's by sharing the products I buy and use, or showing viewers how to style their curls, I want Latinx people to know that someone from their own community can look like me and still fit in.What inspired you to start creating on TikTok?Growing up I hated my natural hair. I'm half Dominican and half Columbian and naturally curly hair isn't something you're told is beautiful. I started my natural hair journey because I was forced to. After years of trying to hide my natural hair, it was very damaged and I needed to take care of it. From then on I became very passionate about all things natural hair, but I made a lot of mistakes that could've been avoided if I had someone to look up to. When the pandemic hit, I started making videos on TikTok and everyone kept asking me what I put in my hair to make it look like that. People were listening, buying my product recommendations, and decided to be the person I wish I had growing up and telling me to embrace my curly hair.What have you learned from the TikTok beauty community?Be authentic and be yourself. There are so many trends on TikTok that you can get lost in trying to follow. Authenticity can really take you places. You always have to remember your 'why' and that will keep you grounded.Do you have advice for someone currentrying to embrace their natural curls?No matter what society says, you look beautiful. I know it will take time for you to see that on your own but be patient, take care of your hair and really try to learn about what makes your hair unique. The beautiful thing about a natural hair journey is it's also a journey of self-love. You're learning to love yourself as you are."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-christianjmaldonado","date":"2022-09-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @christianjmaldonado","text":"Christian Maldonado is a first-generation Salvadoran and Guatemalan creator.

Those stories can touch on all aspects of their lives, including current events like elections and political issues. As we have set out before, we want to continue to develop policies that foster and promote a positive environment that brings people together, not divide them. We do that currently by working to keep harmful misinformation off the platform, prohibiting political advertising, and connecting our community with authoritative information about elections. Today, we are building on that approach by making a series of changes to government, politician, and political party accounts that we believe will help ensure TikTok remains a fun, positive and joyful experience. Verifying accountsIf our community is watching content from an account belonging to a government, politician, or political party, we want them to know the account is genuine. We don't proactively encourage politicians or political parties to join TikTok, but we welcome those that have chosen to and want to ensure our community knows the source is authentic when watching that content. Verification lets our community know an account is authentic and belongs to the user it represents, which is a way to build trust between high-profile creators and their community. While many political accounts have added the verified badge to their profile already, doing so is currently optional. Starting today in the US, we'll be trialing mandatory verification for accounts belonging to governments, politicians, and political parties through the midterm elections.Prohibiting monetization and campaign fundraisingTikTok has long prohibited political advertising, including both paid ads on the platform and creators being paid directly to make branded content. We currently do that by prohibiting political content in an ad, and we're also now applying restrictions at an account level. This means accounts belonging to politicians and political parties will automatically have their access to advertising features turned off, which will help us more consistently enforce our existing policy.We recognize that there will be occasions where governments may need access to our ads services, such as to support public health and safety and access to information, like advertising COVID-19 booster campaigns. We will continue to allow government organizations to advertise in limited circumstances, and they will be required to be working with a TikTok representative.Additionally, we will be prohibiting these accounts from accessing other monetization features. Specifically, they will not have access to features like gifting, tipping, and e-commerce, and will be ineligible for our Creator Fund. These changes, along with our existing ban on political advertising, mean that accounts belonging to governments, politicians, and political parties will largely not be able to give or receive money through TikTok's monetization features, or spend money promoting their content.Finally, over the coming weeks, we'll also be changing our policies to also disallow solicitation for campaign fundraising. That includes content such as a video from a politician asking for donations, or a political party directing people to a donation page on their website.TikTok is first and foremost an entertainment platform, and we're proud to be a place that brings people together over creative and entertaining content. By prohibiting campaign fundraising and limiting access to our monetization features and verifying accounts, we're aiming to strike a balance between enabling people to discuss the issues that are relevant to their lives while also protecting the creative, entertaining platform that our community wants. You can read more about the details of these changes in our Help Center."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-benulus","date":"2022-09-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @benulus","text":"Berenice Castro (@benulus), also known as “Benulus,” is a fashion stylist with an affinity for maximalist and vintage fashion. She is unapologetically authentic and encourages others to wear clothes that make them feel their best. Her infectious smile, magnetic personality and energy radiate off the screen and are the key accessories in how she approaches fashion.What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?To me, el ser Latinx is about a beautiful language that connects us, and deeply understanding the many countries that belong to LATAM. No matter what, we all connect through colorful cultures full of history, authentic recipes with native crops, music that feeds the soul, and our family. My parents have taught me the meaning of love, family, and union. Being Latina is about taking pride in your humble roots and background as well as understanding the social conflicts that exist within our community and standing up for them. To say that I am proud of being Latina isn’t enough to express how I feel about belonging to such an amazing and unique community.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok is where I learned how to use my voice. It has allowed me to find community, regardless of growing up as a minority. I always felt like society told me my opinion wasn't as important or that I had to lower my voice because my culture was just “too loud.” The TikTok community has inspired me to be unapologetic, embrace my loud, happy voice and stand up for myself, my culture and my beliefs.How would you describe your style?Bold, maximalist, and free of judgment. I grew up afraid of what people thought about me. When I went to college I decided to be my true self, which is reflected in my style. Be yourself — if you like to be looked at, make bold fashion choices.How do you share your culture on TikTok?Fashion is a big part of who I am and how I like to express myself, on and off TikTok. I try to incorporate a little bit of Mexico into all of my outfits like Mexican artesania, gold jewelry, and by supporting Latinx small businesses. My style is also heavily inspired by the Mexican Revolution era, the brave Adelitas, and the infamous Frida Kalho.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?Growing up in a humble Mexican household with four siblings meant having to share everything and typically purchasing secondhand clothes. Although I was embarrassed at the time, I am so grateful I was taught to appreciate my parents' hard work and the value of goods regardless of if they're brand new.My biggest passion is to educate people on how to reduce their carbon footprint. Thrifting is a huge part of that. I am able to achieve an amazing outfit with fully thrifted clothes, and I encourage my followers to find their personal style and to stop overconsuming by purchasing things sustainably. I believe it takes courage to decline brand partnerships that don’t align with my beliefs, especially when my biggest financial income comes from collaborations. Spreading awareness and being authentic to my audience is much more important to me.Why is sustainable fashion important?I'm a very empathetic person. I feel deeply about world events and issues. I've always wanted to take care of the earth and think about the environment. It's important to me that I reduce my carbon footprint. Even if I'm the only one doing it, at least I'm trying my best."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/a-new-way-to-tap-into-the-booktok-community","date":"2022-09-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"A new way to tap into the #BookTok community","text":"Whether you're into sci-fi, mystery, romance or sci-fi mystery romance books, or identify as anything from a casual reader to a bookworm, every type of reader can find their unique community on #BookTok.

Users in the US and UK can now access the BookTok feature by clicking \"Add Link\" and searching for \"Book\" before posting their video. Users can tag any Penguin Random House title available in their respective country and once the video is posted, the selected title(s) will be featured above the captions. Users can also save titles to their \"Favorites\" tab on their profiles.“Nothing else engages readers like #BookTok—it brings books to life in a whole new way,” said Alyssa Castaneda, Head of Social, Penguin Random House U.S. “At the same time, #BookTok validates that word of mouth is still the most powerful force for our industry.

Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy to people, and any attempt to promote violence runs counter to that mission and our values. To further strengthen our commitment to user safety and human rights, today we're announcing our membership with Tech Against Terrorism and bringing more transparency to the steps we take to protect our community from violent extremism.Standing together against violent extremismAt TikTok, we believe that collaboration is critical to solving today's most pressing challenges, including violent extremism. We are proud to be members of Tech Against Terrorism, which brings together technology companies, civil society, and academics over the shared goal of countering violent extremism. Coming together with others in the industry reflects our desire to engage with the wider community of experts in a responsible way. Our aim is to help eradicate terrorist content online and share learnings with others along the way.Joining Tech Against Terrorism means we've earned their Trustmark, proof that we adhere to membership requirements, which include commitments to exploring new technical solutions and working with civil society on combating violent extremism. The Trustmark also demonstrates our strict policies and enforcement against violent extremism and our commitments to human rights and transparency. For instance, we publish regular Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports that bring visibility to the content and accounts removed for violating our policies. And we recently announced plans to provide researchers with API access to study the TikTok platform and moderation system.There's no finish line when it comes to keeping people safe. Through our membership, we're eager to continue to learn from others as we strive to meet and exceed best practices in tackling this issue. It will also provide access to training and detection resources to help us effectively respond to such content and actors.TikTok's zero-tolerance approach to violent extremismTikTok maintains a zero-tolerance policy on violent extremism. Individuals or groups that threaten violence or attempt to incite violence risk the safety of our community. Our Community Guidelines clearly outline that we do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals, or acts.We use a combination of technology, safety and security professionals, and threat detection partners to help us enforce our policies. If an account attempts to promote or glorify off-platform violence or threaten public safety, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. We may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals and take action on their accounts. In addition, our trust and safety teams partner with local experts and civil society organizations to understand the unique cultures and experiences of communities affected by violent extremism. We take into account publicly available information from experts, including the United Nations Security Council and Southern Poverty Law Center, to designate dangerous or hateful individuals and organizations. Our goal is to prevent our platform from being used to perpetrate harm. TikTok is an entertainment-first platform, and today only a small portion of videos - less than 1% of the total removed - violate our violent extremism policy. Nevertheless, we will continue to work towards doing our part to help eradicate this kind of content online and off."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/becybersmart-back-to-school-tips","date":"2022-08-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"#BeCyberSmart: Back to school tips","text":"The clock may be ticking until students head back to school, but there's no final countdown on our passion for empowering people of all backgrounds who love to #LearnOnTikTok. This back to school season, TikTok hopes to inspire students, families, and seasoned professionals of all ages to #BeCyberSmart.We believe it's important to help bring representation into the cybersecurity industry through programs designed to diversify, educate, and empower. With over 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs unfilled across the fast-growing cybersecurity sector, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, TikTok is championing a new #SeeYourselfinCyber initiative from the National Cybersecurity Alliance (NCA). Whether connecting Historically Black College and University (HBCU) students to the cybersecurity job of their dreams or creating a new scholarship program through Cyversity, we're committed to nurturing next-generation talent and helping under-represented minorities start or advance their career.“TikTok is helping us tackle the need for more cybersecurity professionals, specifically in the disproportionate underrepresentation of women and minority populations,” said Beverly Benson, Executive Director at Cyversity. “Individuals from underserved communities will be able to receive training for in-demand security roles through this innovative program.”To make strong online choices easier, TikTok and the Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) developed an interactive Cybersecurity Toolkit for Individuals. The toolkit provides a step-by-step guide with free tools and resources to help everyone defend their digital footprint.\"People get confused about what to do to protect themselves online, but they don't need to,\" said Phil Reitinger, President and CEO of the Global Cyber Alliance. \"It's easy for content creators and families everywhere to make significant strides to protect themselves and their privacy by using the Cybersecurity Toolkit for Individuals from GCA and TikTok.\"Here are some of our favorite tips to follow - whether at school, work, home, or on the go - and everywhere you may be online.Always do the 2-step: Use caution when connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi. Set strong, unique passwords on all accounts, and enable 2-step verification for extra security.Double check for typos: Emails, texts, or DMs from people you don't know with spelling, punctuation, or grammar errors may be phishing or smishing attempts. Don't click on suspicious links, report spam-like activity, and block these senders.Be wary of fake offers: Look out for scammers posing as employers. Recruiters or hiring managers will use an email address that matches their company, and they won't ask for personal information or money in exchange for securing an interview or being certified for a role.Avoid public meeting links: Don't post or share links to a virtual classroom on social media or other publicly available websites. Only make links available to specific attendees, and require a password or use the waiting room feature for the host to control who joins.Protect everything connected: Enable automatic updates to protect your family's smartphones, computers, gaming systems, and other web-enabled devices from viruses and malware.For students, professionals, or career changers looking for inspiration and empowerment to #SeeYourselfInCyber, check out NCA's Career & Education Guide for a vast collection of free resources. You can also explore open roles with TikTok's Global Security Organization in New York, Washington DC, Mountain View, Los Angeles, Nashville, Dublin, Singapore, and more.

We're proud to be a place that brings people together over creative and entertaining content, and we work hard to keep harmful misinformation and other violations of our policies off our platform. As the US midterm elections continue, we're sharing more on the work we're doing to protect our community during this time.Connecting our community to authoritative informationProviding access to authoritative information is an important part of our overall strategy to counter election misinformation. That's why we're rolling out an Elections Center to connect people who engage with election content to authoritative information and sources in more than 45 languages, including English and Spanish. For instance, people can learn how and where to vote through information provided by the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) and who and what is on their ballot from Ballotpedia. We're also collaborating with Center for Democracy in Deaf America to provide information on voting as a deaf person; as a student, with help from Campus Vote Project; and as a person with past convictions, with help from Restore Your Vote. For more information on voting as an overseas citizen or service member, you can visit the Federal Voting Assistance Program. As election results are reported, the latest results will be available in our app from the AP.We are committed to promoting digital literacy skills and education, and our in-app center will feature videos that encourage our community to think critically about content they see online, as well as information about voting in the election.For any action that requires a user to share information, such as registering to vote, users will be directed away from TikTok onto the website for the state or relevant non-profit in order to carry out that process. TikTok will not have access to any of that off-platform data or activity.Labeling content across our appTo ensure that our Elections Center is visible and accessible, we'll be adding labels to content identified as being related to the 2022 midterm elections as well as content from accounts belonging to governments, politicians, and political parties in the US. These labels will allow viewers to click through to our center and get information about the elections in their state. We'll also provide access on popular elections hashtags, like #elections2022 and #midtermelections, so that anyone searching for that content will be able to easily access the center. At any time, viewers can use our tools to automatically filter out videos with words or hashtags they don't want to see in their For You or Following feeds.Enforcing our policiesTikTok has a longstanding policy to not allow paid political advertising, and our Community Guidelines prohibit content including election misinformation, harassment - including that directed towards election workers - hateful behavior, and violent extremism. To enforce our policies, we use a combination of people and technology. We also review content and accounts reported by community members. To bolster our response to emerging threats, TikTok partners with independent intelligence firms and regularly engages with others across the industry, civil society organizations, and other experts.In addition, TikTok partners with accredited fact-checking organizations who help assess the accuracy of content in more than 30 languages, and while they do not moderate content on our platform, their assessments provide valuable input which helps us take the appropriate action in line with our policies. Out of an abundance of caution, while content is being fact checked or when content can't be substantiated through fact-checking, it becomes ineligible for recommendation into For You feeds. We also inform viewers of unsubstantiated content and prompt them to reconsider before sharing potential misleading information.Building on lessons learnedWe regularly look to learn lessons from our experiences in elections globally so that we can continually strengthen our approach. After the 2020 election, we set out some lessons learned from our approach that we wanted to improve on in future elections. We're already meeting one of them by launching our in-app center 6 weeks earlier than in 2020 to capture more of the midterms conversation over the summer months.Another challenge we identified in 2020 was educating our community about the rules around paid influencer content. TikTok does not allow paid political ads, and that includes content influencers are paid to create. We work to educate creators about the responsibilities they have to abide by our Community Guidelines and Advertising policies as well as FTC guidelines. For sponsored content that is allowed, we've introduced a tool that makes it easy for creators to disclose paid relationships with brands and organizations.Over the next few weeks we'll publish a series of educational content on our Creator Portal and TikTok, and host briefings with creators and agencies so the rules of the road are abundantly clear when it comes to paid content around elections. If we discover political content was paid for and not properly disclosed, it is promptly removed from the platform.We are constantly looking at how we can improve our practices and processes to protect the safety and integrity of our platform during elections. We'll have more to share in the coming weeks, including some further steps we're taking regarding political accounts on TikTok as we work to foster an authentic environment for our community.From our partners\"We believe the world will be a better place if every citizen has access to accurate, unbiased and non-partisan election information -- who is on the ballot and what they stand for -- so they can make informed decisions about their vote. We are pleased to work with TikTok to help their community not only understand the candidates and their positions but also to empower them to feel confident when they cast their ballot.\" - Leslie Graves, Ballotpedia Founder and CEO\"The Center for Democracy in Deaf America is committed to fostering political conversations and civic education through American Sign Language. We are proud to partner with TikTok in working toward a more perfect union in which civic information is accessible and deliberation possible -- not just for some but for everyone.\" - Brendan Stern, Executive Director, Center for Democracy in Deaf America at Gallaudet University\"We saw historic youth and student voter turnout in the 2018 and 2020 elections. We have also seen the astounding growth of TikTok over that same time. Fair Elections Center's Campus Vote Project is excited to work with TikTok again this year to provide young people and students the information they need to navigate registering and voting, perhaps for the first time. Particularly on a platform they are already using to connect about the things that are important to them and their peers.\" - Mike Burns, National Director of Fair Elections Center’s Campus Vote Project\"Democracy works best when everyone has the opportunity to vote without barriers. Restore Your Vote, a project of Campaign Legal Center, is glad to partner with TikTok to help empower people with felony convictions by giving them the tools they need to make their voice heard.\" — Blair Bowie, Restore Your Vote Manager, Campaign Legal Center"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/celebrate-latin-music-with-suenaentiktok-on-august-10","date":"2022-08-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Celebrate Latin Music on Aug. 10 with #SuenaEnTikTok","text":"Driven by emerging music and trending songs, TikTok has become a catalyst for songs by artists of all levels to travel across borders, helping them to make an impact around the world.

That's why long ago we made an important commitment to transparency, particularly when it comes to how we moderate and recommend content.To fulfill this commitment, we've continually taken concrete actions to earn people's trust. To name a few examples:Two years ago we launched our industry-leading Transparency and Accountability Centers, which raised the bar by allowing experts to access our moderation practices and information about our recommendation system. We've hosted hundreds of guests virtually since opening during the pandemic, and look forward to opening our physical centers soon.TikTok has published transparency reports since our platform's early days. We've also increased the frequency of our reporting and expanded transparency in each of our quarterly Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports. For instance, we were the first platform to report the number of suspected under-age-13 accounts removed, and the first to break down content removals across sub-policies.We established our US Content Advisory Council in 2020, and have since created additional Safety Advisory Councils in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific, Brazil, and Latin America. The councils are comprised of independent, industry-leading experts in each region who advise on a range of content policies and safety strategies.We recognize there's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to having a great TikTok experience, so we've continued to provide options for people to customize their preferences. For example, we recently announced a new way to filter keywords and hashtags associated with content you don't want to see in your For You and Following Feeds, and we'll roll out additional features and tools in the months ahead.We aim to surpass the high expectations our community and stakeholders rightly have for us so we can continue to serve everyone who creates, connects, and is entertained on TikTok. We've been listening to feedback from different communities of researchers, academics, and experts, and are today sharing new initiatives to strengthen transparency and accountability of our platform.Providing API access to research the TikTok platform. Currently researchers do not have easy and accurate ways to identify and assess content and trends or conduct tests of our platform. We're developing a research API to improve ease of access to public and anonymized data about content and activity on our platform, and plan to make it available to selected researchers later this year.Providing API access to research our moderation system. In addition, we've developed a moderation system API which we plan to make available this fall at our Transparency and Accountability Centers. This moderation system API will provide selected researchers an effective way to evaluate our content moderation systems and examine existing content available on our platform. In our Transparency and Accountability Centers, researchers will also be able to upload their own content to see how different types of content are either permitted, rejected, or passed to moderators for further evaluation.Deepening information sharing with our Content and Safety Advisory Councils. The independent experts on our US Content Advisory Council and regional Safety Advisory Councils will also be granted API access as well as access to confidential information, such as our keyword lists (which are used to help detect and flag potentially violative content) for deeper analysis. We don't make keyword lists available publicly in order to avoid providing a roadmap for bad actors who attempt to subvert our safeguards. While we have dedicated teams regularly stress-testing our processes and tools to ensure they're robust and effective, we know that perspectives and insights from experts can strengthen our approach.Expanding our transparency reports with information about countering covert influence operations. Part of what makes TikTok unique is the overwhelming authenticity of our creators and their content. We don't allow activities that may undermine the integrity of our platform or the authenticity of our users. Going forward, in our quarterly Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports, we'll publish insights about the covert influence operations we identify and remove from our platform globally to show how seriously we take attempts to mislead our community.These initiatives are well underway and will be launching over the coming months this year. We'll update on our progress as we continue to innovate when it comes to being transparent and accountable.

Every day, audiences from around the world learn, entertain and express themselves on TikTok without limitations. We continue to invest in creating an inclusive and accessible environment so that our growing global community can feel free and comfortable expressing themselves and finding connection with others.In 2021, we launched captions so that creators around the world could transcribe their own videos to generate subtitles that make content more accessible to everyone.Today, we're introducing new caption and translation tools in hopes of lowering the language barrier to help bring entertaining global content to more users. These updates will support an initial batch of languages including English, Portuguese, German, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish and Turkish and include:Auto-generated captions: With auto-generated captions, in addition to creators, viewers now have the option to turn on closed captions for videos, helping make entertaining content more accessible.Translations for captions and video descriptions: With translations for captions and descriptions, we want to help users enjoy TikTok videos beyond the original language.Translation for text stickers: We're also bringing translation to text stickers in videos, that way people don't miss out on any entertaining content.These easy translation solutions help overcome language barriers and bring people closer together over shared entertainment. Through these efforts, global content will become more accessible regardless of the language(s) you speak and where you are in the world. We're at the early stages of rolling out these tools, which are available on select videos at this time.TikTok continues to be committed to investing in product updates that celebrate our diverse community and make everyone feel welcomed, included and entertained.

Essential to that experience is the knowledge that users have a safe and secure experience on our platform, and I can proudly say that we've made significant progress in delivering on the promises we've made to our global community, business partners, and governments around the world.With our recent announcement about data management changes in the US, it's time for me to transition from my role as Global Chief Security Officer into a strategic advisory role focusing on the business impact of security and trust programs, working directly with Shou, Dingkun and other senior leaders.At TikTok, the security and privacy of our global community is always our priority. We know that staying ahead of next-generation cyberthreats requires continuously strengthening the security of our platform. That's why we constantly work to validate our security standards and collaborate with industry-leading experts to test our defenses. I'm immensely proud of our work in the past 2+ years – including a few of the many highlights we accomplished together:Strengthening our global security organization, developing a world-class organization that fosters a culture of security and transparency, and establishing global Fusion Center operations along with our global Transparency & Accountability Centers.Advancing industry-leading capabilities in data defense and trust assurance as a critical part of our security protocols. This includes daily testing and validation, minimizing employee access to user data, and minimizing data transfers across regions with a focus on addressing who has access, why they need it, and where those people are located.Earning ISO 27001 certifications in the US, UK, Ireland, Singapore, and India for investing in the people, processes, and technology to keep our community safe, along with an ioXt Alliance certification for meeting rigorous standards and commitments to cybersecurity, transparency, and privacy.Establishing relationships with top public, private, and governmental organizations, including leaders like the National Cybersecurity Alliance, Identity Theft Awareness Center, Global Cyber Alliance, Europol, and INTERPOL through industry programs to ensure the protection of online communities around the world.Moving from last place in NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence Social Media Manipulation evaluation to 2nd place in this year's report, recognizing our commitment to investing in automated technology, comprehensive policies, and growing our team of experts to stay ahead of the ever-evolving tactics of people and organizations who aim to mislead others.This all has been possible thanks to the hard work and dedication of our global security organization. As I prepare to sign off from this role, I'm excited to move into a new one with pride in all that we’ve accomplished. I look forward to taking on this new focus as strategic advisor to the company, and I can’t wait to watch the amazing things TikTok and its global community will continue to imagine, build, and deliver to the world in the years ahead.A Message from TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and ByteDance VP of Technology Dingkun HongSince first meeting Roland Cloutier, we immediately felt his passion for what we are building. Since Day 1, he has embraced our mission to inspire creativity and bring joy with an unwavering focus on safeguarding our global community. His thoughtful and strategic approach to enabling teams and ensuring business operations protection at scale is among many of the attributes that make Roland a stand-out leader. He joined the company at a pivotal moment, when TikTok was at the center of a global conversation on data security.Over these past 2 years, he has demonstrated the commitment, resilience, and innovative spirit that his team, our creators, and those who partner and advertise with us needed, taking special care to understand their viewpoints and building our approach to data security to reflect them. This approach has helped us continuously improve our safety controls and people's experiences.Part of our evolving approach has been to minimize concerns about the security of user data in the US, including the creation of a new department to manage US user data for TikTok. This is an important investment in our data protection practices, and it also changes the scope of the Global Chief Security Officer (CSO) role.With this in mind, Roland has decided to step back from his day-to-day operations as Global CSO, effective September 2nd. He will take on the role of strategic advisor to the company, continuing to work together with senior leadership to help us focus on the business impact of our security and trust programs.We are grateful for Roland's many significant contributions to the organization, and we thank him for his leadership and the strong foundation he built for our important work in keeping our community secure.Kim Albarella will serve as interim head of our Global Security Organization to help ensure a smooth transition while we maintain a strong focus on data privacy and security excellence. We are confident in Kim’s deep understanding of security issues, combined with her more than 20 years of leadership and communications experience, and we are grateful to her for taking on this role.We will work closely with Roland, Kim, and the entire team to do our part to make sure that our creators, partners, and community can expect the same outstanding service, commitment to security and joyful creativity that the company has always provided, and we want to extend a thank you to all of our global and U.S. security teams whose dedication and collaboration are integral to our continued success."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love","date":"2022-07-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"More ways for our community to enjoy what they love","text":"By Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and SafetyTikTok's diverse community transcends generations, spanning from teens to grandparents and everyone in between.

For instance, certain categories of content may be ineligible for recommendation, and viewers can use our \"not interested\" feature to automatically skip videos from a creator or that use the same audio.To further empower viewers with ways to customize their viewing experience, we're rolling out a tool people can use to automatically filter out videos with words or hashtags they don't want to see from their For You or Following feeds - whether because you've just finished a home project and no longer want DIY tutorials or if you want to see fewer dairy or meat recipes as you move to more plant-based meals. This feature will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.An update on our efforts to diversify recommendationsWe want to play a positive role in the lives of the people who use our app, and we're committed to fostering an environment where people can express themselves on a variety of topics, while also protecting against potentially challenging or triggering viewing experiences. Last year we began testing ways to avoid recommending a series of similar content on topics that may be fine as a single video but potentially problematic if viewed repeatedly, such as topics related to dieting, extreme fitness, sadness, and other well-being topics. We've also been testing ways to recognize if our system may inadvertently be recommending a narrower range of content to a viewer.As a result of our tests and iteration in the US, we've improved the viewing experience so viewers now see fewer videos about these topics at a time. We're still iterating on this work given the nuances involved. For example, some types of content may have both encouraging and sad themes, such as disordered eating recovery content. We're also training our systems to support new languages as we look to expand these tests to more markets in the coming months. Our aim is for each person's For You feed to feature a breadth of content, creators, and topics they'll love.Introducing Content Levels to help further safeguard the viewing experienceWhether people come to TikTok to search for recipe inspiration, have a laugh after a long day at work, or discover new interests through their For You feed, we continually work to create a safe and enjoyable viewing experience. Our Community Guidelines are central to this by setting the standards for what is and is not allowed on our platform. Within these strict policies, we understand that people may want to avoid certain categories of content based on their personal preferences. Or, for our teenage community members, some content may contain mature or complex themes that may reflect personal experiences or real-world events that are intended for older audiences.Recognizing this, we are working to build a new system to organize content based on thematic maturity. Many people will be familiar with similar systems from their use in the film industry, television, or gaming and we are creating with these in mind while also knowing we need to develop an approach unique to TikTok.In the coming weeks, we'll begin to introduce an early version to help prevent content with overtly mature themes from reaching audiences between ages 13-17. When we detect that a video contains mature or complex themes, for example, fictional scenes that may be too frightening or intense for younger audiences, a maturity score will be allocated to the video to help prevent those under 18 from viewing it across the TikTok experience. We have focused on further safeguarding the teen experience first and in the coming months we plan to add new functionality to provide detailed content filtering options for our entire community so they can enjoy more of what they love. Building for the needs of our global communityAs we continue to build and improve these systems, we're excited about the opportunity to contribute to long-running industry-wide challenges in terms of building for a variety of audiences and with recommender systems. We also acknowledge that what we're striving to achieve is complex and we may make some mistakes. Our focus remains to create the safest and most enjoyable experience for our community and we will continue to listen to feedback from our community and continue consulting with independent experts, including our Content Advisory Council."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-launches-follow-me-for-smbs","date":"2022-07-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Introducing Follow Me to help small businesses build community and grow their business on TikTok","text":"By Sujatha Mamidibathula, Head of SMB, North AmericaToday, we're introducing Follow Me, a multi-channel educational experience designed to help small-and-medium businesses (SMBs) leverage the power of TikTok to drive real world results.

Follow Me will serve as a guide for SMBs looking to share their stories, build their community on TikTok, and achieve their business goalsAuthentic Storytelling Leads to Real ResultsSmall businesses are an important part of the TikTok community. Every day, people share their unique stories, promote their products and services, and take us behind the scenes as they grow their business. They've taken us inside their kitchens, workshops and storefronts, and in return, we've seen them grow from garages to warehouses as people across TikTok are discovering new businesses down the street and around the world.We've heard from countless small businesses that TikTok has helped them launch or build their business -- and some have told us that TikTok helped them survive the darkest days of the pandemic. In part, this success seems to stem from the fact that small businesses feel \"at home\" on TikTok and are enjoying the experience. According to a recent report published by Hello Alice, 81% of small businesses say that TikTok is fun and 73% say it's easy to use.We created the Follow Me experience to empower more small businesses to dive into TikTok, so that they can also share their story with the TikTok community and reach their goals. Learn from Small Business AmbassadorsStarting July 11 small businesses can learn the latest tips from our Small Business Ambassadors, Cassie Sorensen, owner and founder of Tassel Amor and Jacob Zander, owner and founder of Feel Your Soul. Cassie and Jacob will share their TikTok journeys and provide tips on how to best tap into the power of community and entertainment to drive real business results.Follow Me will offer different learning roadmaps based on visitors' goals and will invite SMBs to a 6-week email series that will outline the best practices for running their first-ever TikTok campaign and integrate their brand's story into their videos.

We have sent a letter to Congress addressing these issues and others, and also want to share with our community the steps we take to secure our U.S. user data as well as where we're headed in our commitment to keeping U.S. user data safe, private, and secure.As we announced in May, we recently stood up a new division called U.S. Data Security (USDS) to bring heightened focus and governance to our ongoing efforts to strengthen our data protection policies and protocols, further protect our users, and build confidence in our systems and controls in the United States.The creation of USDS was an important milestone in the goals we laid out in a blog post two years ago: minimizing employee access to U.S. user data and minimizing data transfers across regions – including to China. We are addressing who has access (and why they need it) and where those people are as two critical parts of our security protocols.Who has access and why they need itAs a rule, security teams want to minimize the number of people who have access to data and limit it only to people who need that access in order to do their jobs. We have policies and procedures that limit internal access to user data by our employees, wherever they're based, based on need. Like many global companies, TikTok has engineering teams around the world—including in Mountain View, London, Dublin, Singapore, and China—and those teams might need access to data for engineering functions that are specifically tied to their roles. That access is subject to a series of robust controls, safeguards like encryption for certain data, and authorization approval protocols overseen by our U.S.-based security team. To facilitate those approvals, we also have an internal data classification system; the level of approval required for access is based on the sensitivity of the data according to the classification system. The intention of these processes and protocols is to ensure that the data is only accessed by those that need it to allow our business and our service to function.Where people with access are locatedTo the extent possible for a global company, we want to limit not just who is accessing data, but also where there is access to data. That's why, in addition to routing all U.S. traffic through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we are also working to build up our U.S.-based engineering capacity to reduce the need for data transfers across regions. As we recently shared with members of Congress, we are working toward a new system in which access to U.S. user data by anyone outside of USDS will be limited by, and subject to, robust data access protocols with monitoring and oversight mechanisms by Oracle.Managing cyber threatsIn addition to our U.S.-specific work, our global security team is constantly working to stay ahead of next-generation cyber threats. We continually work to validate our security standards and collaborate with industry-leading experts to test our defenses. In the past year, we’ve earned ISO 27001 certifications in the U.S., UK, Ireland, Singapore, and India for investing in the people, processes, and technology to keep our community safe. The ioXt Alliance also certified TikTok for meeting rigorous standards and commitments to cybersecurity, transparency and privacy.We're dedicated to earning and maintaining the trust of our global community, and we will remain focused on protecting our platform and providing a safe, welcoming, and enjoyable experience."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/celebrating-blacktiktok-at-essence-festival-of-culture-2022","date":"2022-06-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Celebrating #BlackTikTok at ESSENCE Festival Of Culture 2022","text":"ESSENCE's Festival of Culture is one of the largest festivals in the world, where thought leaders, creators and world entertainers come together to celebrate the diaspora of Black culture.

We release these quarterly reports to bring transparency to the actions we take to help keep TikTok safe, welcoming, and entertaining for our global community.This report has been expanded to bring ever-more transparency to our actions, progress, and challenges, and to stay accountable to our community. For instance, we now report the 30 markets with the largest volumes of removed videos which account for approximately 80% of overall video removal volume. There are also new charts for spam account activity and fake engagement. In addition, we now breakdown removals by sub-policy. As an example, we're publishing the volume of content removed for hateful ideologies and for attacks and slurs, the two sub-policies under our hateful behavior policy, as well as the percentage of content removed proactively, at zero views, and in under 24 hours by sub-policy. This data is available for download in machine readable formats to support further analysis by researchers, academics, and civil society.Given the war in Ukraine, this report also reiterates our ongoing efforts to strengthen TikTok's policies and practices to better protect our platform and community.

Zaya has transparently documented her full transition process, highlighting her struggles and obstacles, and inspiring her community along the way.What does it mean to you to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?Personally, I view being part of today’s LGBTQ+ community as a symbol of the past. Being able to live openly and share my lifestyle on social media has made me forever grateful for the trailblazers that came before me. Black & brown queer people paved the way for what the LGBTQ+ community has become today, and without them, I’d have nothing. Therefore, being part of this community means that I am spreading their legacy while living my truth.What inspired you to start your journey on TikTok?It's hard to find people who share their full trans journey on TikTok. With my transition, I wanted to be completely transparent so people can see the truth, know what you actually need to go through, and understand that everything turns out okay. I want to inspire people and let them know how I live.Why do you think it's important to see this kind of content on TikTok?There are so many people who are ignorant about trans people. There are a lot of stigmas and stereotypes about trans women. When someone sees someone like me and I don't fit their mold, they understand we are human and live just like anyone else.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has shown me all sorts of things I’ve never seen before. There have been countless individuals that have come across my For You Page and changed me for the better. Because of TikTok, I’ve been inspired to be more authentic, be more unapologetic, and just be me.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?This video is my favorite for many reasons. For starters, it shows part of my recovery process after undergoing gender-confirming top and bottom surgery. This is something that most people don’t get to see. I take great pride in knowing that I am helping people learn about the transition process. It’s not all flowers and roses.This video also highlights my strength and the things I’ve done to feel valid in my identity. I’ve had countless people reach out and tell me that it is one of the most educational videos they’ve ever seen regarding transgender surgeries, and that puts a huge smile on my face.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?I enjoy educating people on trans issues. I also have a passion for traveling, spiritually, art, acting, makeup, and helping trans youth in need."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-theemuses","date":"2022-06-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @theemuses","text":"Thee Muses (@theemuses), Adrienne Muse and Janeeka Muse, are your favorite queer aunties that surround you with positivity and protection.

We are both the first to come out in our family as queer so to be able to be a part of a community that accepts us and allows us to break barriers is empowering. We are always happy to help those in need and stand against societal issues that may try to bring us down. We are strong, we are seen, we are loved and we are here!How have you built and maintained a community on TikTok?By staying true to ourselves. We believe our authenticity shows through the content we create. We welcome everyone no matter what they look like or what they've experienced, and provide a safe space for everyone to feel accepted and to heal past experiences. We want our followers to feel like they have a space to call home.Why is representation important when it comes to spirituality?Our platform is based on spirituality and defining your power within yourself. You hold the power to manifest what you want in your life. And we also have fun and find humor in life. This representation is important because spirituality has been so demonized for centuries. We are both Aquariuses, and now it is the Age of Aquarius! We're going to bring the truth to light whether people want to hear it or not. People are thirsty for the knowledge. We want people to know that our platform is a safe space to take what you want and explore.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?Our favorite video is set to the sound “How Bizarre”, where our nieces, nephews, and niblings mention their bully got hit by a car.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?We're passionate about creating art and painting murals.

This summer we're excited to partner with Barnes & Noble and our creator community to bring back summer reading like it's never been done before with the launch of the #BookTokChallenge. Starting today through August 31, we're encouraging people to discover and read new books and authors and then share their reactions with the TikTok community using #BookTokChallenge.The #BookTokChallenge builds on our community's spirit of creativity and collaboration to harness the power of books to help people expand their minds through reading. As teens are home from school and families are looking for engaging offline activities to do over the summer, diving into a new book is something everyone can do whether at their favorite bookstore or local library. Once they're done reading a new book, they can share what they've read on TikTok and how it's meaningful to them, and inspire others to do the same.To help bring this to life and encourage others to participate, we've partnered with beloved TikTok creators who've made a name for themselves on the platform through their incredible book reviews, including @aymansbooks, @bookpapi, @kendra.reads, @kevintnorman, @maistorybook, and @thebooksiveloved. The #BookTokChallenge also kicks off our new partnership with Barnes & Noble to drive B&N customers to a dedicated #BookTok hub, aimed at driving book discoverability IRL at participating Barnes & Noble stores and online at bn.com. In the coming days, visitors can scan a QR code that takes them to a dedicated #BookTok hub, also accessible in-app, featuring videos from TikTok creators and local Barnes & Noble sellers as well as popular books among the #booktok community across a range of literary genres - all in an effort to unite our community around the love of reading. “We are looking forward to exploring these new avenues within TikTok,” said Michele Laikowski who heads up Social Media for Barnes & Noble.“The #BookTok community has been such a driving medium in discovering favorite paperbacks and bringing worthy titles back to the forefront of customers’ minds. Helping more readers enjoy good books is key to Barnes & Noble’s purpose, and when you pair our local Bookseller recommendations with #BookTok recommended reads, any reader can consider their summer plans booked.”With nearly 11M videos and reaching over 60B views globally to date, #BookTok is the go-to hashtag for books, reading, writing and everything in between and it's just one delightful corner of TikTok that has led to a widespread cultural impact off platform. Books are among the oldest forms of entertainment, and, in line with TikTok's mission to inspire creativity and bring joy, we developed the #BookTokChallenge to encourage book fans and others to take a break from watching to enjoy reading.

His legendary food haul videos, which can be easily recognized by hearing a restaurants name, followed by the word \"ORDERS!,\" have helped Dakota establish a community of viewers that admire his positive relationship with food and honest opinions. Dakota's presence in the LGBTQ+ community on TikTok is significant. Many LGBTQ+ people in his audience, also from small towns, have shared that they don't have positive, authentic figures like him in their day-to-day lives. He embodies self-acceptance, while promoting acceptance of others, and encourages everyone to \"live their best life, unapologetically\" through his videos.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok highlights creators who are simply being themselves, giving platforms and communities to essentially everyone. The feeling of \"togetherness\" that TikTok provides is truly organic and has allowed me to become more confident and express myself in ways I never thought were attainable. Now more than ever, I find peace in connecting people within the LGBTQ+ community and connecting non-LGBTQ+ people with us. I strive to make content that appeals to everyone and hope that a byproduct of doing so promotes acceptance of LGBTQ+ people. I set an example and provide a safe place for people to learn.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?This video is hands down the most iconic video I've filmed. I had JUST paid my car off and to reward myself I had it wrapped in pink glitter! This video embodies everything I am — confidence, sass, humor, pink, and unapologetic. As the beginning of the video states, I've always wanted a pink car. Never in a million years did I think I would be in a position to get one but here we are. I was ecstatic to show everyone that if you want something, go get it. What's stopping you? I wanted a pink car and I made it happen. My full-time job is being a realtor and our vehicles are one of the first impressions we make to consumers. The pink car indicates that I'm loud, confident, and willing to go above and beyond. The reception from my community on TikTok was well received. People went NUTS over this car. I received many comments of people saying they've always wanted to wrap their cars, or start carrying a purse, and even get their first set of nails. The craziest thing was that some of the people commenting that, actually did it, made a video, and tagged me in it! I was truly touched at how influential this short video was. To this day, I receive comments and direct messages of people saying they've seen my car somewhere and it reminded them to \"not give an eff what people think.\" Who knew a southern gay and his pink glitter car would make such an impact? Certainly not I!What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?When I'm unplugged, I enjoy spending time with my mother, husband, and cat named Katy Purry. Family is important to me. My husband and I travel often to build memories and discover new territories. We both are obsessed with The Real Housewives. On TikTok, I enjoy watching other food creators, satire POVs, makeup routines, and other couples. One of my biggest passions is reading comments on videos. Conversations in the comment sections sometimes make videos more hilarious than intended. I've cried tears of laughter several times just by reading comments, even on my videos.What is your dream opportunity?Ideally, I would love to have a TV show with my husband. I love spending time with him creating memories and what better way than to work together on something entertaining! The marriages in reality TV, good and bad, are something I've always enjoyed watching. The experience itself would be really wholesome to watch from the outside looking in. On a larger scale, if I or we ever became \"rich and famous\" I would love to start a charity organization for LGBTQ+ adolescents who have their lives uprooted after \"coming out\".What is the story behind your username?I get this question all the time! In 2013, I bought my first PlayStation, and I had to make a username. My name was taken, and at the time Jersey Shore was big, so I had a lot of animal print on my mind. At the same time, I was also being called a \"fairy\" as a derogatory term. I always felt like fairies were cute, and I love fairies, so I decided to redefine the term for myself.What advice would you have for other working professionals looking to create a presence on TikTok?Turn the camera on and hit record. Don't worry about a thing, just post your content. Other creators often have draft videos and send them to me for feedback. Almost every time I'm left wondering why they hadn't already hit \"post.\" You don't know who your content will resonate with, but there's a community out there for everyone. So, just hit record and post it."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-naomiheartsxo","date":"2022-06-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @naomiheartsxo","text":"Known on TikTok as @naomiheartsxo, this LA-based lifestyle creator posts relatable comedic videos.

Naomi is the name I chose when I transitioned, so that portion has a deeper meaning to me. The word \"hearts\" sounded beautiful after it — it gave me life. I added \"xo\" because I didn't like using the underscore, and the \"hugs and kisses\" meaning felt like a natural addition to the username.Best advice you've ever received?It's a bit of a cliche, but the best advice I've ever received is to live life for myself. At the end of the day, people will want us to live up to some kind of an unattainable expectation. Mistakes will be made, and owning up to mistakes is important, but you have to live your life for you. I was out in high school, and then reverted back to the closet when I entered the working world. Before I came out again, I was petrified to share details about my transition. It caused me so much depression hiding my true self, especially since I had already been out and proud.

It means I am part of a long line of incredible people who didn't accept the status quo in the name of self-expression and love. It is because of the LGBTQ+ community that I can be who I am every day. I don't take that for granted or lightly. It has given me a perspective on not just LGBTQ+ issues, but an empathy for anyone who is judged, stereotyped, or mistreated. I am a better person because of this community.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community is one of the most authentic spaces you can find. It is people unabashedly being themselves and discovering themselves. It is an environment where you can find connection, relatability, and community. It is by watching others talk about their struggles that I cannot just post about mine but heal from mine. My For You page directs me to folks who's issues I may not share but can empathize with and take with me in the real world.How have you built and maintained a community on TikTok?I have built and maintained a community on TikTok by bringing my whole self to the platform. I speak on issues that affect me living in the middle of the country. I utilize the trends and culture of TikTok itself to share my perspective on the world. I showcase my on-air wardrobe and undercut or dance with my co-anchor to bring some levity to what normally is a heavy space in the news studio.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?Although it may not be one of my most viewed, it is the most meaningful TikTok I've made. I came out to my parents in 2011 and it was devastating when they didn't accept me. For years they yelled at me or blamed it on a number of things until it turned into a topic we didn't discuss. I was always career-oriented so they told me never to go public about it because it would ruin my dream of being a successful news anchor. In 2020, I posted my first TikTok featuring my undercut, suit and a TikTok-specific indictor that I was a lesbian. It blew up. I started gaining a following from the very thing they thought would ruin my career. That month, I started dating someone I really liked. A year later, I was able to bring her home, introducing my parents to the first girl they would allow over, a decade after I came out. It went incredible.What is your dream opportunity?My dream opportunity is to anchor a successful streaming morning newscast that is accessible to people on their phones. Something that people can listen to or watch when they're lying in bed or getting ready for work. I would love to be able to do this from a platform like TikTok, Hulu or Netflix.What advice do you have for working professionals who want to share their authentic self on TikTok?Do it. So many people in the queer space have reached out to me, especially older queer folks who have been in a business for 25 years, telling me that they’ve only come out to a small number of people at work about being gay. That is wild! I’d encourage everyone to bring their whole selves to work and the public so that you have the freedom to be authentic and vulnerable without having to hide the real you! Plus, it will inspire the future generation or others who are afraid to come out with the comfort of knowing that they have a supportive network on TikTok!"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-kevintnorman","date":"2022-06-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @kevintnorman","text":"Kevin T. Norman, known on TikTok as @kevintnorman, is a queer Latinx creator from Los Angeles, CA who combines humor and his love of reading to help promote diverse and queer stories. He inspires people to read more, introduces them to LGBTQ+ books, and amplifies queer voices.What does it mean to you to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?It took me a while to accept that I was gay because I had to tackle religion, self-hatred, and a lot of awkward conversations with friends and family. But now, I live a life where that part of myself is celebrated, and I couldn't be happier.To me, being a part of the LGBTQ+ community means being adaptable, imaginative and wildly courageous. It's learning to picture yourself in media and entertainment when it often fails to represent you. It means being confident because it takes immense strength to be who you are in a world that demands for you to be someone else. To be queer is to be resilient and hopeful. It means facing adversities but knowing you never have to face them alone. It's having a found family and your own culture. It's being a part of a community that will always accept you as you are. Because who you are is beautiful.How have you built and maintained a community on TikTok?I have built a community on TikTok by being truthful about who I am and what I’m passionate about. Because I grew up without access to queer books, I wanted to create a resource for those who might be in search of them. Through TikTok, I have discovered a fantastic community of queer individuals and allies passionate about storytelling that tell stories through a queer lens. While growing this community, I have collaborated with some amazing brands that share this vision and continue to engage with other creators, supporting their content, and building long-lasting relationships. I also love to go on TikTok LIVE to engage with my followers and use that time to create an interactive space where we can collaborate. Because my account focuses heavily on books, I get to interact even more with this community that we have collectively built. We often discuss the many books we read and ask each other for new recommendations, which allow for a constant flow of creativity, ideas, and expression. TikTok has allowed me to combine my training as a performer and my love of books to create thoughtful, funny, and engaging content that I hope encourages people to read more.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?I feel as if every new video I make is my favorite, but one of my recent favorites is this video that combines queer content with humor!How would you describe the #BookTok community to someone who is not familiar with it?The BookTok community is a very diverse and welcoming community. Everyone is excited about reading and promoting stories. The cool thing about the community is that you can find a niche part of the community for any type of genre. There’s romance #BookTok, queer #BookTok, fantasy #BookTok and so much more!What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?The amazing thing about TikTok is that it allows me to use my passion as a performer, love of reading, and artistic creativity to produce content emphasizing learning and books. I didn’t have anyone to talk to when I was figuring out my sexuality, so I turned to literature to find answers. When I came out, books were a tool that helped me feel less alone and helped me better understand my queerness. LGBTQ+ stories deserve to be told, and my passion is to creatively share them.In addition to reading, I love to write poetry, and although I don’t discuss poetry on my channel, I have been able to use my platform to showcase my poetry book. I also love to travel and be outdoors. My boyfriend and I have made a promise to visit every National Park together, and so far, we’ve been to over 15! I have dubbed us “The National Park Gays.” I am passionate about food, both cooking and eating. I am a vegetarian, so I love cooking new recipes that use vegetables in fun and creative ways. Ultimately, my biggest passion is learning. This has led me to learn how to create digital art, format a book, speak Spanish, design a website, and more! I want to do so much in life, so I try and teach myself all that I can.What is your dream opportunity?There are so many things I want to do. I’d love to act in an LGBTQ+ focused television series, be a television show host where I can interview trailblazers and share inspiring stories and traditionally publish and see my books in stores worldwide!"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-imdrebrown","date":"2022-06-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @imdrebrown","text":"DeAndre Brown, known on TikTok as @imdrebrown, is a 22-year-old who currently resides in Dallas, TX.

Outside of his corporate humor videos, he also motivates his followers through his car talks, where he promotes putting yourself first and finding self love. DeAndre refers to his followers as \"Corporate Baddies\" and \"THE ELITE,\" who have become loyal to DeAndre in a very short period of time.What does it mean to you to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?Being a part of the LGBTQ+ community means the world to me! The fact that I live in a society where I can openly express myself truly inspires me to ensure the same can happen for those who come after me. Within the LGBTQ+ community, there is so much talent and creativity, and it truly makes this world a better and more inclusive place. Being in corporate America, it can be difficult to find people who identify with me. So, I make it my mission to educate minorities on opportunities for jobs within corporate America, because our voices matter and we deserve to be seen.How has the TikTok community inspired you?My TikTok community inspires me to live my truth and follow my purpose. I truly believe I was called here to inspire others to be themselves and to share my experiences to lift up others. TikTok has given me the platform to do just that and I am forever grateful.What is your favorite TikTok you’ve created and why?This video I posted will always be my favorite. It really allowed me to know that so many people experience the same thing I do while working in corporate spaces. This video was the first step that really led to all my later success on TikTok.What are some of your passions on and off TikTok?Thanks to TikTok, I can proudly say my passion is to become a TV personality. When I was in high school, my classmates and I had to go around the room and share what we wanted to be when we were older. I will never forget the feeling I had when I said, “I want to be a TV personality,” and everyone laughed. They even told me I would be poor forever. At that very moment, I gave up on myself. I stopped chasing that passion because I allowed other people’s opinions to deter me. While I am very happy with the path that I took instead (corporate America), I believe that TikTok is showing me that my dreams were not crazy! I make sure to share this story with my followers to encourage them to follow their journey, regardless of how crazy people may think it is.Why did you start creating #WorkTok content?When I was growing up, I realized there was a divide in opportunities that minorities receive and have access to corporate spaces. I wanted to be the voice that shows people they can be in these spaces and help them find the opportunities to get there.Do you have advice for young people entering the workforce?Don’t be afraid to set boundaries. People worry that if they set boundaries, they’ll get fired. But if you try it, you’ll realize that by putting yourself first, you will feel happier at work and improve your mental health. Prioritize yourself and perform to the best of your ability."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-dylanmulvaney","date":"2022-06-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @dylanmulvaney","text":"Dylan Mulvaney (she/they), known as @dylanmulvaney on TikTok, is a trans actress/comedian/content creator living in Los Angeles, CA.

Dylan is currently writing and developing scripted content, and her greatest hope is to bring trans and non-binary stories to the stage, screen, and beyond.What does it mean to you to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?It means walking proudly in the clothing I wear, the pronouns I use, and the people I surround myself with. I love my queerness!How has the TikTok community inspired you?Every day, my followers continue to cheer me on in my transition journey, and I love that I can reach so many people in such a short amount of time.What is your favorite TikTok you’ve created and why?I love the video where I keep tampons in my purse for anyone who needs one, because I think it shows my heart and empathy for all kinds of humans!What’s the best advice you ever received?When I started transitioning, my aunt – the “cool aunt” of the family – said, “Dylan, be patient with yourself.” I think that advice applies to transitioning, accepting opportunities and relationships. It’s important to take your time and acknowledge what you’re going through. When it comes to a transition, time is of the essence. The person transitioning had to work through the experience personally before sharing it with the world. To anyone dealing with gender identity or sexuality questions, I encourage you to do a deep dive on yourself and take your time.What advice do you have for someone who wants to share their authentic self on TikTok?Throw spaghetti at the wall. Try anything and everything – and if something doesn’t stick, move on to the next thing. I tried so many things on TikTok before something finally stuck, so don’t be afraid to get vulnerable and messy – and just try to have fun! That’s what we’re making videos for: our enjoyment and the enjoyment of others.What are you excited about for the future?I’m excited to show that trans people can have healthy, happy relationships and families. On TikTok, I shared my Day 1 as a girl, and maybe the world will still be watching me on Day 10,000. No matter what, I’m honored to be a person who can share the trans experience with everyone."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-dannylovespasta","date":"2022-06-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @dannylovespasta","text":"Danny Freeman is the creator behind @DannyLovesPasta, where he's known for his colorful and creative take on fresh pasta and Italian cooking.

Danny is currently working on his debut cookbook.What does it mean to you to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?When I first came out over 15 years ago I felt scared and alone. After a very religious upbringing, I didn't know what my life as a gay person could be like. But it turns out I had no reason to be afraid. The LGBTQ+ community was extremely welcoming, and it gave me everything I could ever ask for: friends, passions, a partner, and my daughter. I feel incredibly blessed to be part of this community that has given me a home in the world. I sometimes worry about what sort of bullying my daughter will face for having two dads, but I feel grateful knowing there is an amazing group of people in the world who will have her back.How has the TikTok community inspired you?So much of the food that I create has been inspired by my TikTok community, and it has given me so many opportunities. The TikTok community has pushed me to be more creative, and inspired me to experiment with more colors, patterns, and shapes in my pasta. This community has also pushed me to share more of my personal story, which has led to deeper connections with my followers.How have you built and maintained a community on TikTok?I try to jump in the comments section on every video so I can answer questions and talk with my followers. I also do a lot of reply videos, and many of the pastas I make are directly inspired by an idea from a follower. Most importantly, I want my followers to feel like they are a part of my content, and to make sure they know that any success I have is really due to them!What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?My favorite video is the first time I shared my personal story about why I started making pasta, and why it means so much to me. I started making pasta after my grandmother passed away last year, and it helped me through a very difficult time in my life. I was so nervous posting this video, because I wasn't sure how people would react or if it would be well received. I'm so happy it resonated with so many people.What advice would you give to someone who would like to start sharing recipes or cooking content on TikTok?My advice would be to share why you're creating and what your recipes mean to you.

From simple recipes to elaborate coffee videos, she is also passionate about normalizing conversations around mental health and intersectional LGBTQ+ topics.What is the story behind your username?I have always had an affinity for frogs, and I guess more generally, I've always had an affinity for things that potentially are considered gross or disgusting. Since I was a child, I was mesmerized by the idea of a frog's metamorphosis from a tadpole, which is also kind of emblematic of the queer community. Also, frogs are really popular now and I'm so glad they're getting the love that they deserve.What does it mean to you to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?The LGBTQ+ community is so much more to me than just a label for a group of people. Instead, it's a family. Without the encouragement and support of the queer community, I wouldn't be here--plain and simple.Not only does being part of the queer community mean valuing and uplifting other members of this community around me, but also it means honoring the history and the long line of people who have fought for our rights. Queer BIPOC communities have sacrificed so much to make it possible for people like me to not only exist, but to truly thrive. And paying homage is important to me as a young queer individual.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has given me the opportunity to unabashedly lean into my identity and to immerse myself with incredibly different, diverse walks of life. Never before have I ever felt so welcomed, accepted, and understood. I never expected to find a safe space within the TikTok community. I am so grateful to be part of this diverse group that inspires me to wear my labels with pride and to unapologetically and authentically live my life.How have you built and maintained a community on TikTok?I always try to represent myself, and honor the many communities that I'm a part of authentically. Through my content on TikTok, I've been able to build a community and connect with wonderful people who are likeminded and always ready to enjoy the little wonders in life with me!What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?I shared a video where I made a lap xuong dish while I spoke about my experiences with food as an Asian-American person. The video is a little heavier than the rest of my videos, but I was able to be vulnerable with the TikTok community. This helped me connect with others around similar topics and experiences, which has been so meaningful to me.What is the best piece of advice you've ever received?The best piece of advice I ever received is to not set yourself on fire to keep others warm. Being a part of so many communities, as a queer and Vietnamese-American person, there's a sense of camaraderie and I'm heavily involved in these communities. But for a really long time, I overextended myself. I set myself on fire. I made myself smaller. I did whatever it was to support others and keep them warm, but I forgot to look after myself at the same time.

She's the big sister you'd come out to, and the best friend who will always encourage you to do what’s best for YOU.What does it mean to you to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?My identity in the LGBTQ+ community means everything to me. When I reflect on the fear I had as a young girl — terrified of ever being true to myself, I wish I could go back and assure her that I would be okay. More than okay, safe. Being a part of this community has given me the feeling of safety I had never fully experienced until now. It's given me the friendships, the chosen family, the love that I didn't know existed. Choosing myself and accepting my identity has created a beautiful relationship between me, myself and I. I could string together beautiful words, but not as beautiful as the smiles, the passion, the drive, the goal to love freely and the self-love I see throughout my community. My community is my everything, it's given me a purpose — one I didn't know I had.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok is the reason I felt comfortable to come out. When I started my journey, I was coming from a very abusive, difficult situation - one that didn't allow me to accept myself and love myself the way I deserved, but TikTok changed everything for me. Scrolling through the app, seeing people share their lives, their struggles, their laughter, and their full selves encouraged me to do the same. From my first video, I slowly became comfortable coming out, and when I did I was showered with nothing but love. I created a community with my fans, with my new friends online and with myself. A place to go to feel safe, to feel heard, to feel wanted and to just be free to be me. If I hadn't started on TikTok and seen the amazing people who fully embraced themselves, I doubt I'd be where I'm at today.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?My biggest passion, on TikTok and beyond, is music. Although I focus on comedy, I have been known to sing in a couple of my viral videos, always with an added twist of comedy.What has your music journey been like so far? How has that impacted your TikTok journey?I'm at the very beginning of my music journey. I am currently working on my first album, where my LGBTQ+ identity will be the main focus. I want those in my community to have positive, upbeat music they can relate to and understand. I want people to jump up and down and sing songs about loving ourselves and each other, regardless of what others have put in our heads. Our lives don't need to be centered solely around the struggles we have been through, our lives are also the joys we have experienced. LGBTQ+ joy should always be shared. TikTok has provided me with the chance to fulfill this passion and showcase my talent to a big audience.What is the best piece of advice you've ever received?I think the best advice I've ever received has actually come from within. Sometimes others weigh in on your life and your choices, but it doesn't resonate until you're affirming it yourself. That advice is that no matter how I dress or act, someone will always judge me. It sounds negative, but it's a helpful reminder to be myself, regardless of who is paying attention. It doesn't hurt to surround yourself with a community built on love, either!What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?This video may be simple, but it's something that brought the LGBTQ+ community together. I always love when sounds go viral and people in my community can make silly, lighthearted content around our identities. Those simple things can mean a lot, especially when some of our worlds are clouded in hatred and homophobia. Scrolling through thousands of videos and seeing those in my community just laugh, smile and create content that's fulfilling to them will always be fulfilling to me, too. That's why I'm a content creator: providing people with a moment to pause, take a breath and smile, even if it's their only smile of the day — at least I made some sort of impact."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-asianchipskylark","date":"2022-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @asianchipskylark","text":"Austin Cho, known on TikTok as @asianchipskylark, is a content creator based in Los Angeles, CA who uses comedic skits to connect with his audience.

He is passionate about creating spaces that celebrate individuals for exactly who they are.What does it mean to you to be part of the LGBTQ+ community?As an AAPI queer individual, it is one of my greatest joys to be a part of the LGBTQ+ community. I want nothing more than to help create a society where being authentic to who you are is nothing less than celebrated. Growing up, I felt as if I had to constantly erase traces of both my AAPI heritage and my queerness for the sheer sake of surviving in social environments. My present-day self does bring forth a sense of grief because I feel like I wasted so many years living in fear and as a result, betraying my authentic identity.I love who I am and ultimately who I've become after embracing and owning the fact that I am an Asian-American gay individual. I make the content that I do because I want others to realize that accepting who you are and unconditionally loving your identity is nothing to put on the back-burner.How have you built and maintained a community on TikTok?I built my community on TikTok by posting various original skits. Once I found my niche, it was relatively effortless to both continue growing and maintaining my community. I found that people needed someone to lean on through my Cool Single Uncle character. After creating the skit and character, I began utilizing him in skits and POVs that would provide a sense of comfort and acceptance in various fearful situations such as: coming out, divorce, toxic households, dating, etc. Because of those videos, I feel more and more connected to the people watching me.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?This was one of my favorite videos that I've created because, as I was filming it, I felt as if I was personally going into every single one of my figurative nieces' and nephews' homes and extracting them from their toxic family environments. It was also one of many videos that I feel like my community connected deeply to.What is the story behind your username?This is a two part story! When I created my TikTok, I wasn't confident in my humor. I didn't want anyone — from my hometown friends to my parents — to recognize me. So, I knew I needed a username that didn't immediately identify me. That same year, I had plans with a group of friends to do a group Fairly Odd Parents Halloween costume, where I was going to dress up as the show's pop singer Chip Skylark. After that decision, his song, \"My Shiny Teeth And Me,\" was on a loop in my head. That, combined with my initial need for being anonymous and feeling like an Asian version of the character, led me to @asianchipskylark, and now it's my brand; I can never go back!What advice do you have for comedians getting started on TikTok?My best advice would be to seek out the right attention, intentionally. Many people get caught up in trying to say the funniest thing, without considering the weight of the joke or how it's perceived. We all want to make people laugh, but my advice is to do so without putting others down. Tell jokes that make everyone laugh. Don't let your desire to make it big outweigh the true purpose of telling a joke.What is your dream opportunity?My dream opportunity would be to have a TV show on any major streaming service. Being a content creator can be lonely at times and I would absolutely love to create a project with others. It would also just be really cool to see myself on a TV series in general."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-at-vidcon-2022","date":"2022-06-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok @ VidCon 2022: Where Creator Magic Happens IRL","text":"VidCon is where the world’s leading digital creators and platform innovators converge in one place to form a magical meeting of talented creators and their fans.

Meet some of the incredible creators from our #BlackTikTok community who share educational content about the impact of Black artists on music, the unfamiliar parts of Black history, and the undeniable influence of Black creativity on mainstream culture.@cultureunfiltered: Culture Unfiltered, spearheaded by former radio host and music blogger Masani Musa, is a hub for music discovery and dialogue surrounding popular culture and trending news in music. Masani was also recently named a 2022 Black TikTok Trailblazer. @joelbervell: Joel Bervell is a medical student committed to fighting health disparities in medicine through education, and regularly shares insights on racial disparities and biases in healthcare on TikTok. Joel was also recently featured as a \"Changemaker\" on TikTok's Discover List. @kahlilgreene: Kahlil Greene, aka \"the Gen Z Historian,\" on TikTok, uses the platform to shed light on the lesser-known facts of U.S. history and politics. His informative, \"edutainment\" videos share intriguing and thought-provoking stories about Black history and culture. @taylorcassidyj: Taylor Cassidy is a content creator on TikTok who uses her quick wit and strong passion to teach millions about unsung figures in Black history. As seen in her video series “Fast Black History” and “Black Girl Magic Minute,” she uses her platform to advocate for inclusion, representation, and love for one’s culture. @whatsgoodenglish: E.K. Powell explains AAVE (African American Vernacular English) through his educational channel What’s Good English, raising awareness of this way of speaking the language which has provided (and still provides) many common phrases and words native speakers use today. He hopes to erase the stigma attached to AAVE and show that it’s not \"bad\" or \"broken\" English, nor do its speakers lack intelligence or education — it‘s just one of the many variants of English and deserves respect. Celebrating #JuneteenthTikTok is a platform for creative joy and inspiration, and it’s made better because of our diverse community of Black creators. Thank you to #BlackTikTok for continuing to inspire millions around the world. Today, we're launching in-app programming for the #Juneteenth hashtag, where you can discover more inspiring stories and educational content from the #BlackTikTok community. Be sure to also follow #Juneteenth, as well as @blacktiktok, a TikTok account dedicated to all the incredible content Black creatives are sharing with the larger TikTok community, year-round."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/delivering-on-our-us-data-governance","date":"2022-06-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Delivering on our US data governance","text":"By Albert Calamug, U.S. Security Public Policy, TikTokAt TikTok, we're committed to a process of continuous innovation and improvement in our user experience and safety controls. We're proud to be able to serve a global community of more than a billion people who use TikTok to creatively express themselves and be entertained, and we're dedicated to giving them a platform that builds opportunity and fosters connection. We also take our responsibility to safeguard our community seriously, both in how we address potentially harmful content and how we protect against unauthorized access to user data.TikTok has long stored US user data in our own data centers in the US and Singapore. Our Virginia data center includes physical and logical safety controls such as gated entry points, firewalls, and intrusion detection technologies. It's also important to maintain backup data storage locations to guard against catastrophic scenarios where user data could be lost, and our data center in Singapore serves as the backup data storage location for our US users.For more than a year, we've been working with Oracle on several measures as part of our commercial relationship to better safeguard our app, systems, and the security of US user data. We've now reached a significant milestone in that work: we've changed the default storage location of US user data. Today, 100% of US user traffic is being routed to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We still use our US and Singapore data centers for backup, but as we continue our work we expect to delete US users' private data from our own data centers and fully pivot to Oracle cloud servers located in the US.In addition, we're working closely with Oracle to develop data management protocols that Oracle will audit and manage to give users even more peace of mind.We're also making operational changes in line with this work – including the new department we recently established, with US-based leadership, to solely manage US user data for TikTok. Together, these changes will enforce additional employee protections, provide more safeguards, and further minimize data transfer outside of the US. This is an important direction from a systems and data security standpoint, and part of our focus on preserving an interconnected experience for our global community while building a security-first culture.These are critical steps, but there is more we can do. We know we are among the most scrutinized platforms from a security standpoint, and we aim to remove any doubt about the security of US user data. We're dedicated to earning and maintaining the trust of our community and will continue to work every day to protect our platform and provide a safe, welcoming, and enjoyable experience for our community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-study-shows-small-businesses-are-finding-their-home-on-tiktok","date":"2022-06-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"New study shows small businesses are finding their home on TikTok","text":"Small businesses are an important part of the TikTok community. Every day, people share their unique stories, promote their products and services, and take us behind the scenes as they grow their business. They've taken us inside their kitchens, workshops and storefronts, and in return, people across TikTok are discovering new businesses down the street and around the world. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have quickly become a beloved part of the TikTok experience and that's why we worked with Hello Alice, a leading organization dedicated to supporting small businesses, to understand SMBs are navigating today's digital world. Hello Alice invited invited 750,000 SMBs in their network** to participate in a study that examined their current use and perceptions of digital marketing platforms, and the resulting report, Small Business Digital Marketing Trends, provides incredible insight into how SMBs are leveraging TikTok to find new audiences, build community and generate real world results.The report revealed that a digital renaissance is underway. Small business owners understand that digital platforms are no longer a nice-to-have, they are a critical tool for reaching customers and growing their business. Moreover, there's a shift among those already leveraging digital platforms, with SMBs increasingly turning to emerging players, like TikTok, to follow their customers and accelerate their growth. In fact, 67% of SMBs surveyed indicated that they are most optimistic about their growth potential on TikTok.A new launchpad for small businessWe've heard from countless small businesses that TikTok has helped them launch or build their business -- and some have told us that TikTok helped them survive the darkest days of the pandemic. In part, this success seems to stem from the fact that small businesses feel \"at home\" on TikTok and are enjoying the experience. According to the report, 81% of small businesses say that TikTok is fun and 73% say it's easy to use. Celebrating communitiesWe've long celebrated out community's ability to be authentic and share their stories without polish or filters, and we're excited to see how small business businesses continue to leverage our creative tools.Starting anything new can be daunting, and we know that launching a business on TikTok is no exception. Once businesses take the plunge, the joy of creating is contagious. Of small businesses who are currently using TikTok, 78% say they plan on increasing their investment in the platform.To all the small business owners who are on the fence, I encourage them to reach out to another small business that is on TikTok and ask them about their experience. When Hello Alice asked why business owners were looking to start or increase their investment on any digital platform, the most common reason was “I’ve heard from other small businesses owners this platform was effective.\" Empowering Small Businesses on TikTokWe want to empower more small businesses to get started on TikTok, so that they can also share their story with the TikTok community and reach their goals. That's why we've launched a number of education programs and our Small Business Resource Center. In the coming weeks, we will also announce an exciting new initiative that will help small businesses leverage TikTok to grow. Sign up here to be among the first to know once it launches.Small businesses enrich our lives. They employ our neighbors; provide solutions for our problems; and make us smile by creating something beautiful. All of us at TikTok are thankful to be a part of what makes small businesses successful, and we're excited to help them connect with communities and thrive. **Methodology behind Hello Alice's report:Three surveys were conducted to better understand how SMBs use digital platforms to market their businesses. The first survey compared five platforms: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat under three broad categories: Platform Use, Impact and Value, and Business Objectives. Data were collected about personal and business demographics as well. The second and third surveys focused specifically on the three broad categories (Platform Use, Impact and Value, and Business Objectives) specifically in relation to users’ experiences with TikTok. The first survey was distributed to a general audience of small business owners, the second survey was distributed to SMBs using TikTok for their businesses (either for organic advertising, paid advertising, or both), and the third survey was specifically distributed to SMBs using TikTok’s paid advertising features. Approximately 7,000 responses were collected between the three surveys; all data were de-identified and aggregated prior to analysis."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/investing-in-our-communitys-digital-well-being","date":"2022-06-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"Investing in our community's digital well-being","text":"By Jordan Furlong, Product Manager, Digital Well-beingAt TikTok, we believe that our digital experiences should bring us joy, entertainment, connection and enrichment. Having a positive relationship with digital devices and apps isn't just about measuring screen time, it's also about feeling in control of how we use technology and ensuring that the time we spend online contributes positively to our sense of well-being. That's why we're announcing a number of steps today to help support our community's digital well-being as they create and discover on TikTok.As we encourage people to think more mindfully about developing positive digital habits, we're launching two new practical tools to make it easier for our community to feel in control of their TikTok experience. We already offer daily screen time limits, which help people decide how much time they'd like to spend on our app each day. In the coming weeks, we're introducing a tool to let people control how much time they spend on TikTok in a single sitting by enabling regular screen time breaks. These prompts will remind people to take a break after a certain amount of uninterrupted screen time, which they can set as they choose.Our new screen time dashboard will also give our community data about how much time they are spending on TikTok, with summaries of their daily time spent on the app, the number of times they opened the app, and a breakdown of daytime and night-time usage. People can also opt for weekly notifications to review their dashboard.To support our community in thinking about their digital habits, we've also published a new guide - How can I reflect on my digital well-being with my family and friends? - on our Safety Center. The guide encourages our community to reflect more holistically about how they spend their time online – whether on TikTok or elsewhere – and how it makes them feel as they set the boundaries that best suit them.We'll also be introducing weekly digital well-being prompts for younger members of our community. When someone aged between 13 and 17 has used the app for more than 100 minutes in a single day, we will remind them of our screen time limit tool the next time they open the app.We hope these new digital well-being tools continue to support our community in fostering a positive relationship with TikTok. We will continue to invest in protecting the well-being of people so that our community can feel in control of their TikTok experience and empowered to express their creativity, make meaningful connections and enjoy culture-defining entertainment.What our expert advisors say:“The research showed that younger users would welcome the introduction of built-in features and settings that prompt them to both think critically about the time that they are spending online, but also encourage them to use settings to actively manage the time they spent on the app. It is important that they feel in control of their online experiences and are helped to make considered choices. We look forward to TikTok developing further features that will put children’s wellbeing at the heart of their design choices.\" - Carolyn Bunting MBE, CEO, Internet Matters\"A sense of agency is a key aspect of wellbeing in digital spaces. People need tools that empower them to use social media intentionally and to be mindful about how, when, and why they use these platforms. Features that provide people with insight into screentime, and allow them to flexibly customize their online experiences to emphasize quality over quantity, can help provide this sense of agency and support mindfulness.\" - Dr. Nina Vasan and Dr. Sara Johansen, advisors from Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation at Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/express-yourself-through-tiktok-avatars","date":"2022-06-06T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Express yourself through TikTok Avatars","text":"From Effect House to Library, longer videos and more, there are many ways to make your creativity shine on TikTok.

She's built an audience on TikTok from sharing her creative nail art and behind the scenes clips of making reusable press ons for her clients.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?My culture has always played a huge part in why I love art. Growing up, I never thought I belonged here in the U.S. I got bullied for speaking English with an accent, for the way my house looked, and what I wore. Thanks to all of the strong API role models I've had on social media, I've been able to rise up from that and come into my own.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has embraced my art and work so much that it makes me push myself to be better--and it helps me to my authentic self! Through TikTok, I've been able to find a ton of like-minded people who geek out about the same things I do.What is your dream opportunity?Considering most of my nail designs are inspired by Disney movies, it would be a dream to have my own show on Disney Plus.How do you come up with your nail designs?Sometimes I will get inspired by something I've seen, or a place I've been. Once I went to a Turkish Delight store. I loved the decor and immediately wanted to replicate that on nails. Another time I went to an aquarium and I saw a weird looking fish, so I wanted to put it on a set. I also get a lot of input from clients. Some will even go through the effort to create a brochure or PowerPoint presentation to show me their personality, which I love because I'm able to create something that's authentic to them. It definitely takes me a lot of time to think about how I want to execute an idea and create the sets. It's a lot more complicated than people might think.What is your favorite nail design that you've ever done and why?Someone asked me to do a set based on Whitney Houston and Brandy in Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella. It was my favorite movie growing up and I had always dreamed of creating a set for it. When I got the request, I was so excited and I was able to do something I already had in mind. Brandy's dress was basically my childhood dream translated onto this set. I also loved doing a set for the movie Rush Hour, which says something about how much I like these old movies. Rush Hour is another one of my favorites and I know every line from the movie. I love Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, and it was so fun to draw them both."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-kukombo","date":"2022-05-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @kukombo","text":"Kukombo is a Chinese-American creative based in New York City with an interdisciplinary artistic background in fashion design, filmmaking, music production, and photography.

To me, API means my family and my home, and it gives me a deep feeling of warmth. I remember staying up late for red packets during Lunar New Year, eating mooncakes during the mid-Autumn festival with my loved ones, and spectating the dragon boat racing during Dragon Boat Festival. Because of what API means to me, it has been disheartening and deeply disconcerting to witness what has happened to our community during the pandemic. I hope to use my position and platform to augment API voices, help others better understand our community, and work towards positive change.How has the TikTok community inspired you?From my experiences on various social media platforms, TikTok has one of the most vibrant, open-minded, and enthusiastic communities. In the year that I have been a creator on TikTok, I witnessed and experienced firsthand the overwhelming support and empowerment from the community to push boundaries, discover my authentic self, and inspire confidence. I greatly appreciate that TikTok allows even small creators who are just starting out to be discovered by a wide audience. This platform has allowed me to take the first step towards my “American Dream”!What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?My favorite TikTok video is the first cinematic cosplay I created, Edna Mode. Before making the video, I had almost no experience working with and creating 3D environments in films. After receiving countless requests from my supporters to create a video dressed as Edna Mode, I decided to dive headfirst into the deep end and started working with CGI. My Edna Mode video quickly went viral and ignited the tremendous growth of my account. This video also really set the tone for the style of all my videos, even though I've made some changes here and there since then. This experience showed me that we should not be afraid to jump into the unknown and put ourselves outside our comfort zone. You never know what pleasant surprises may come along the way.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?My TikTok videos are an amalgamation of my passions. I started artistic endeavors through music and dance. While in elementary and secondary school, I produced numerous original songs and covers before transitioning to film, where I could create a visual component to accompany the audio. I participated in various student film festivals and received numerous awards, including Best Experimental Film and Most Promising Student Filmmaker at the British Columbia Student Film Festival. I also received a nomination for Best Editing at the All American High School Student Film Festival. These artistic endeavors led me to fashion design, because most of my projects required unique styling and garment creation. These interests ultimately led me to study at Parsons School of Design for fashion design.What is your dream opportunity?My dream is to launch my own fashion brand. Fashion design has always been one of my favorite creative outlets. I love designing and styling costumes for each of my TikTok videos. Additionally, as an extension of my TikTok content, I would love to produce and direct my own music video, and act in feature films and TV shows.What advice would you have for someone who is just starting out as a designer or VFX creator?Don't be afraid to fail, because for every one of my videos, I mentally brace myself for something that will go wrong or there will be a problem I'll need to solve. Just try to be patient and work through it. If you don't know how to solve your problem, do a lot of research to figure it out or find a way to go around the problem if you can't fix it. I'd also say it's important to create because it's fun, not because you need to do it. This can be a very taxing process, so if you're not creating out of joy, you're really going to burn out quickly."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/becybersmart-tiktok-summertime-safety-tips","date":"2022-05-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"#BeCyberSmart: TikTok Summertime Safety Tips","text":"School’s almost out for the summer!

To Hina, the most important thing is bringing representation to their communities, especially young queer Asian folks who never saw themselves in the media.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?My entire identity is centered around my culture. As a child, I immigrated to the United States from Japan. My parents changed my name to \"Katelyn\" and my Japanese name, Hina, was no longer used. For most of my young life, I always tried to fit into the American mold of how to be, how to act, or how to speak. I \"fixed\" my accent and stopped speaking Japanese. I asked my mom to stop packing me a bento for lunch. After about a decade of living in the US, I felt lost and depressed. Sensing this, my mom took me on a trip to visit home. When I arrived back in Japan, I felt an inexplicable peace, and a sense of belonging and safety washed over me. I had lost myself by neglecting who I was and where I was born. When I came back to America, I decided I would take Japanese classes again, speak only Japanese to my mom, make Japanese friends, learn to cook Japanese food, and read Japanese books. I never let that sacred part of me fade away again. There is a tremendous tenderness in my heart for the people in my API community, because many of them have had very similar experiences to me. By connecting with this community, I'm never alone and I always have a piece of home with me.How has the TikTok community inspired you?I am truly indebted to the TikTok community. I have never in my life felt more accepted, more visible and more proud of my identities anywhere else. What I think is beautiful about TikTok is that your videos will be seen by someone who needs to see it, which makes it easy to find your community. My fellow API and queer creators, who are all so creative, talented, funny and intelligent, inspire me every day. The TikTok community is a place where I can go to spend time with people who feel like my friends. On TikTok, people are authentic and candid, which I feel allows you to find true connection within the community. It inspires me to feel the world isn't all that big and we all have something that connects us.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why? My favorite video I've ever created was a collaboration with my fellow API creator, Austin Cho where we played out a scenario of a gay and lesbian married couple. We met through TikTok and we have an insane creative chemistry. It's my favorite video, because I think it's a testament to TikTok's ability to create community and the magic that can come from connecting with others in the community. We've become really close friends and creating with Austin is so fun.What is something people may not know about you just from watching your Tiktok content?People might not know English is my second language. Because I don't have an accent, people tend to assume that I'm a native English speaker, but my mother tongue is Japanese. When I moved to the US, I actually had to relearn English. My dad was always at work and at home, I always spoke Japanese to my mother, so I ended up forgetting English. It became a really big insecurity when I was growing up, because I thought people perceived me as being stupid because I couldn't speak English as well as others. Because of my insecurity, I was driven to learn a lot of different languages. In fact, I've learned seven or eight languages.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?I believe my life's purpose is to create more and more meaningful representation for Asian, lesbian and non-binary people in popular media. Whether that be on TikTok or in the writers' room. It is the single most powerful force behind why I do what I do. I am passionate about creating a safe space for people to exist without shame or hiding themselves.What advice would you give to a comedy creator who's just starting out on TikTok?If your comedy hurts somebody, then it's not funny, which is one thing I stand by. I think a lot of people have to challenge themselves and ask \"how can I make comedy that is funny and is relatable, but also uplifting and makes people feel good?\" I think that's what brings people back to your content. I like to make fun of lesbians as lesbian myself, but I do it in a playful way. It's really about learning where that line is when you make comedic content. Also, people should not be afraid to be as niche. Finding a niche and what makes your content really special is a novelty. People love seeing things they've never seen before. Think about your interests and see if there a two things you love that you could bring together. Maybe that's comedy and reading books. Find those niche spots that make you unique."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-justthenobodys","date":"2022-05-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @justthenobodys","text":"Next up in our Creator Spotlight series is @justthenobodys, a podcasting duo made up of two brothers, Ryan and Daniel Omoto.

Just The Nobodys represents not having to be a “somebody” to make a difference in the world, and their platform showcases family friendly content inclusive to all races and communities.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?It's about being a part of a community that feels like family, celebrating life, achievements, food, rising above adversity, and much more. It is empowering knowing where we came from. Our ancestors, grandparents, and parents had to endure and sacrifice a great deal for us to have an opportunity to be successful and live out our American Dream. Those of us in the API community have shared experiences. We have all faced adversity and hardships that only minorities have experienced. Our grandparents were placed in internment camps. They were American citizens, yet stripped of everything they had because of the color of their skin. They came out of the camps with nothing and had to start anew. Their sacrifice, grit, and perseverance has always motivated us to give 100% in our content making. We want to represent the API community in a positive way and honor our ancestors that rose above their circumstances and discrimination.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has inspired and motivated us by seeing diverse communities around the world have success on the app. Knowing that we're able to express our passions and interests freely is empowering. It's a space where people can bond over shared experiences and viral challenges, be advocates for their communities, raise awareness around specific causes, build stronger connections and create lasting memories. As influencers, we feel empowered and supported. Specifically, the For You Page has been an appreciable feature highlighting all people to be heard and seen around the world. TikTok has truly built an inclusive platform reflective of the diverse world we live in.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?Our favorite video is one where we talked about Squid Game. This video means a great deal to us because Squid Game became a global phenomenon and the biggest show of 2021. Furthermore, it showcased an all-Asian cast that is paving the way for future generations and representing the Asian community in the entertainment industry. It was a dream come true to be able to talk about the biggest show of the year and support the API community at the same time. It encompassed everything that we stand for by not only exhibiting inclusion, but also featuring Asian representation, which allowed us to discuss pop culture. Having the two intertwined is rare.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?Ryan: My hobbies include golfing and music (guitar, bass, piano, and ukulele). I recently graduated from California State University, Los Angeles with a Bachelor's in Fire Science and I am a licensed EMT. One of my passions is to serve my community. I am also in the process of obtaining a Private Pilot's License to expand my horizons. I would like to create more content by traveling. I enjoy watching movies and television shows. My utmost passion, though, is creating content on TikTok with my brother, Daniel.Daniel: My hobbies include basketball, golfing and playing video games. I also enjoy playing guitar and bass. I am currently obtaining my Bachelor's in Healthcare Management at California State University, Dominguez Hills. I love watching movies and binge watching streaming shows. Having the opportunity to discuss our passions and interests on TikTok has been one of the greatest shared experiences alongside my brother, Ryan.What is your dream opportunity?We'd love to have our own interactive talk show where we showcase other API creators and others around the world. We want to create a fun and entertaining space where individuals can learn from guests that work in interesting fields and share their personal experiences. We want to be advocates for equality and diversity and give everyone an opportunity to be heard and seen.What advice do you have for other podcasters who are just starting out?Post on TikTok to showcase your passion.

From dance and music, to fashion, beauty, culture, and promoting social causes, the Jikaria Sisters aim to break barriers and create inspiring content that blends their South Asian and American identities.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?We bridge our Indian and American culture through engagement with the API community. In this space, we can show up without hiding parts of ourselves. It's the community we wish we had had when we were younger. Our mission is to show others in the community that it is possible to pursue dance and art, while also pursuing our more \"traditional\" careers (i.e., law, engineering, business). Growing up, we were told we would have to choose between art vs. traditional careers. As adults, we are now showing the world that it's possible to honor every part of your upbringing and pursue multiple passions. We are glad people resonate with our story, inside and outside of the community.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has inspired us in three main ways. First, we feel inspired by other creators who embrace their varying identities and background. It’s empowering to see creators who we relate to culturally – we have become friends with so many others, both on and offline. Second, we have developed relationships with our community across five continents, and created dialogues to have important culturally and socially driven conversations. Third, we are inspired by the equity TikTok represents. Anyone with a camera can make content and we love that the barrier for creating and sharing art has been lowered.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?Our favorite TikTok video we created was a dance to a mashup of Aaja Nachle (a Bollywood song) and Low (an American song). We combined Bollywood and Hip Hop, two different dance styles we grew up learning. In this video, we showed that it’s possible to embrace both sides of our culture. From then on, we created many more mashup dances, and people tell us that our Aaja Nachle x Low video was the start of South Asian fusion dance on TikTok.What are some other communities you each identify with?We identify with the mental health community. We believe in the power of dance for promoting self-care and wellness, and encourage our community to find ways to incorporate self-care into their lives through the arts. We also identify with the women in law, women in STEM, and women in business communities, as we pursue multiple different careers. We are passionate about increasing South Asian and female representation in each of these spaces.What has been your favorite campaign so far and why?We really loved working with Toyota. We partnered with the brand for a campaign centered around Diwali. We participated in both a photoshoot and dance to celebrate the holiday and to promote one of their 2022 vehicles. It was such an honor to spread awareness about our culture and celebrate a day centered around light, while working with such a familiar brand. Our entire family, parents included, drive Toyota cars!What advice would you give to dance creators on the platform looking to build a brand?Be authentic to your identiy and interests. Our followers gravitate toward authenticity, in addition to the joy and happiness we spread. You should also remain consistent. There might be times that you feel unmotivated, but we promise that consistent creativity, experimentation, and learning will help you grow as a person and as a creator. Use TikTok to explore yourself and your identity."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-foodwithsoy","date":"2022-05-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @foodwithsoy","text":"Soy Nguyen (known on TikTok as @foodwithsoy) empowers her audience by exploring the intersectionality between food, culture, and mental health. She embraces food from different cultures, recommends her favorite spots to grab a bite, and shares educational content revolving around her Vietnamese-American identity through her mom's recipes.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?Being a part of the API community has been such an empowering experience for me. Growing up in Florida, with a lack of API friends, I grew up with internalized racism. I didn't want to be Vietnamese because I just wanted to fit in. With a lot of time, kindness and understanding for myself, I started embracing all of the wonderful things the API community had for me. I realized that I am the representation that I didn't have growing up. That's why it's so important that my content highlights the diverse facets of the API cultures, including my own Vietnamese American experience.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has helped me find my purpose. I'm so thankful of the community and space I've been able to cultivate through TikTok. I have always felt like it's a community-first platform and I'm so proud to be a part of it. I've had people come up to me, sharing that my videos helped them eat again. I've had small mom and pop shops tell me their sales increased because I highlighted them. I've had comments about how lovely it felt to be seen through me embracing their culture. I'm truly inspired by everyone on the platform and the stories I've been able to see.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?In this TikTok, I remember my eyes were so puffy because I had just hopped off a plane after leaving my mom, but I was hungry and wanted to share these raw thoughts and emotions. It was such a powerful energy exchange, much like most of my \"eat with me series\" videos. I started this series during the pandemic because I realized that I had a hard time being alone in my thoughts to the point where I wasn't even eating. I thought if I was having this issue maybe someone else was too. This series lets me eat and share vulnerable life lessons about everything from self love, social anxiety, friendships, breakups and more. In API cultures, many look at mental health as a weakness. I feel that, with true emotional capacity, awareness, and understanding, it's a beautiful thing to care, and I want to showcase that.What is your dream opportunity?Having my own TV show would be a dream!What is your favorite restaurant you've ever visited? Why?It's hard to decide what my favorite restaurant ever is, because I connect with food in so many different ways and I'm constantly trying new things. My favorite spot lately, though, is Merkato, an incredible Ethiopian restaurant in the Little Ethiopia neighborhood in LA. I had somewhat sworn off Ethiopian food, because I didn't love my first experience with it. After several strong recommendations, I had to give it a second chance, and it's safe to say I don't regret it. From the service to the ambience and the food, of course, I'm still thinking about that meal and the overall experience; 10/10!What advice would you give to someone starting a TikTok account who wants to mix heartfelt content and food?Food is so universal -- it can be a vehicle for making connections, cultural education, sharing recipes and more. If you can use that vehicle to create an authentic, purposeful foundation, you should. Don't think about followers or views. If you have purpose, people will come for the food, but stay for your stories."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-erikakullberg","date":"2022-05-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @erikakullberg","text":"Meet Erika Kullberg (@erikakullberg), an attorney, personal finance expert, graduate of Georgetown Law, and now one of the most followed lawyers on social media.

After spending years as a corporate lawyer, she founded Plug and Law, an online legal company making legal more accessible for online business owners and entrepreneurs.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?It’s an honor to be part of the API community. I was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an American father. When I moved to the US, the API community truly welcomed me, and I always felt at home, despite moving around every three years with my dad serving in the US military.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok is a community where everyone can be themselves. I love that I get to come as I am to TikTok and not have to worry about presenting myself a certain way. Everyday I’m inspired by new creators on TikTok.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?I’m proud of the airlines’ tip TikTok video because it shows how powerful a single TikTok can be in empowering millions of people. Many people aren’t aware of their rights (in this case, when it comes to airline travel), and I love that I can use TikTok as a platform to educate others.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?I’m really passionate about financial literacy. I didn’t grow up learning much about money. In my household (and more generally in the Japanese culture), money isn’t something that we are supposed to talk about. When I graduated from law school with over $200,000 of student loans, I realized just how little I knew about finance and that if I wanted to get out of debt I would need to teach myself. Once I got out of debt, I wanted to share everything I learned about personal finance (investing, paying off debt, saving, etc.) with others, which is why I started creating content on social media. I’m a proponent of transparency around money and think financial literacy is essential to improving your financial situation.Some of my other passions include law and the creator economy. My company, Plug and Law, is dedicated to making legal accessible to small business owners and entrepreneurs who may not necessarily be able to afford expensive lawyers.What has been your favorite financial hack you've shared so far?My favorite financial hack is the airlines tip. Most people can relate to having a frustrating travel experience and not knowing what to do and their rights. I like to take these regulations and fine prints and break them into 30-second, easily digestible TikToks.What advice would you have for someone trying to start a finance advice account on TikTok?The most relatable content is stuff that you have personal experience with. For me, a recurring theme is how I got out of debt. It's really important to remain authentic on TikTok and talk about what is relevant to you because that will be what people resonate with."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-dynah-tui","date":"2022-05-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @dynah.tui","text":"Dynah (@dynah.tui) is a young Pacific Islander who is always looking to share culture, smiles, laughs, and PI values on TikTok.

To this day, I’m motivated by them to create new content, pursue new hobbies and practices, and participate in communities that move me. TikTok has become a platform that allows me to feel so many things and connects me to new people and opportunities!What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?While I have a few, my favorite to date is a dance video I created with my cousins. We had a really good time practicing the dance, putting our unique twist on the moves, and creating behind-the-scenes footage. I also loved the positive feedback from the viewers, saying that they were surprised yet delighted by our little twist, which in hindsight, we didn’t think much of, and their reactions made us appreciate it that much more.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?School and sports have been top priorities for me. When I’m not with my family, I’m studying or hitting the gym. I grew up playing volleyball and dabbled in basketball and paddling, so the gym has become an essential part of my routine. I’m a STEM girl, but I’ve always loved the arts! At one point, I had a fleeting dream of acting, and in hindsight, I’m pursuing that by expressing my creativity on TikTok.What is your dream opportunity? What are some other communities you identify with / are a part of?My dream opportunity would be to act and be on a show. Being a part of something that will live on forever has always been a dream. I also love the creativity involved in the production process and connecting with people in front and behind the camera. I’d love to combine my interests in content creation and entertainment in amplifying the API and mental health community.What is something important that people should know about your culture and home?I love incorporating my home, my people, and my culture in my videos! It’s a privilege to live on this beautiful island, and it’s been an honor to have a platform that allows me to showcase my identity with the community.

Using his motto, “education, not influence,” he empowers people to make informed decisions about their skin health, mixed with the right amount of humor and fun.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?I grew up in an area of the US where I was one of few people that identified as API. There weren't many people that looked like us, sounded like us, or had the same traditions. Being \"different\" often led to bullying or name calling. We were even placed in English as a Second Language (ESL) classes because of our names, even though we were born in the US and could only speak English. Fast forward 20 years, TikTok has been amazing because it creates a digital community of similar interests and backgrounds. Today, you may not have many API friends around you but you can find this online community with similar backgrounds and struggles. It creates a sense that you're not alone, like I was growing up. By being an API creator and one of the most followed people on TikTok, it allows other younger people to realize what's possible for someone like them to achieve.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok changed my life. I went from being able to teach and treat 30 patients a day to being able to teach millions of people across the world. The reach has led to many amazing opportunities both online and offline.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?My favorite videos are ones that raise awareness for conditions that were previously thought to be rare. Many people are unaware that they have this condition and often suffer in silence. I've even had patients come to my office after seeing that video seeking treatment for this condition because they didn't even know they had this until they saw the video.What inspired you to share your knowledge on TikTok?I posted one video about skincare, and people kept asking me questions. They wanted answers that weren't available to them elsewhere. So I created a video response to questions that were asked of me, and as that grew, I realized how big the space for accurate information about skincare and dermatology was.What is the most memorable interaction you've had with a commenter on TikTok?The most meaningful moments to me are when my content crosses over into someone's daily life. For example, somebody commented \"I went and got a suspicious mole checked out because I saw your video. I got disagnosed with skin cancer early on, and I never would've known otherwise.\" It means so much to me when people thank me and let me know I've changed and improved their life. It keeps you making content because you know you're resonating with your community and making an impact. The fact that I can do this at scale through TikTk is an amazing feeling.What advice would you have for other healthcare professionals who would also like to become creators?Start posting. Don't overthink your content. If you're a healthcare professional, you have knowledge that people will benefit from. If you can package that up in a simple way for people to consume, you will reach people and make an impact, so don't let your negative thoughts or the fear of being judged hold you back. Sharing your knowledge on TikTok could change other people's lives and your own for the better."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/celebrating-our-jewish-tiktok-creators","date":"2022-05-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Celebrating our #JewishTikTok creators","text":"In honor of Jewish American Heritage Month, we're celebrating the history and resilience of the Jewish community and its widespread impact on U.S. culture.

In today's society, there is this expectation that women must be the bigger person and take the high road by remaining silent as a way to give men patience and kindness. I am someone who will not be respectful in the face of disrespect. I will show up, speak up, and support other females and marginalized groups.

It is not a reflection of you, so once you understand and accept that, create an environment of not living in fear of receiving any hate or rejection. The way I handle negativity is very specific to me. However, block and report buttons exist freely, so leverage those tools to take control of the negativity.What is the best piece of advice you have ever received?The best advice I’ve ever received was from my mom.

We're mindful that everyone who comes to TikTok has different life experiences and backgrounds, and we strive to foster a supportive environment where everyone feels safe exploring and sharing their stories.Today is National Fentanyl Awareness Day, an opportunity to join together to educate ourselves and others about the growing fentanyl epidemic. This public health crisis has undoubtedly touched the lives of many across the US, and we're taking action to educate our community about the dangers of illicit drugs, remove drug content on our platform, and partner with experts to connect our community with resources. We're also pleased to share our support for California Assembly Bill 1628, which will require online platforms like TikTok to publicly post our policies related to the sale and distribution of illicit substances like fentanyl.Supporting the well-being of our communityPeople come to TikTok to express themselves, find support, connect with people who share their experiences —and this is especially evident among those who have been impacted by addiction. We've seen our community embrace hashtags, like #recovery and #addictionawareness, which offer hubs for conversation, learning, and encouragement. To help maintain this trusted atmosphere, we take a strict stance against content that promotes drug use on TikTok.Our Community Guidelines make clear that we do not permit the depiction, promotion, or trade of drugs or other controlled substances. We developed our policies with an eye toward empathy and healing, which is why we allow people to share their personal experiences with addiction and recovery. Additionally, our advertising policies prohibit the promotion, sale, or facilitation of access to illegal drugs, controlled drugs, prescriptive drugs, recreational drugs, and drug paraphernalia. We also encourage people to let us know if they feel concerned about another person on the platform.Preventing the spread of harmful contentWe use a combination of technology and people to review content uploaded to TikTok. We also empower our community to report content that they believe may breach our Community Guidelines using our simple in-app reporting function. In addition, we redirect searches and hashtags like #drugs to our Community Guidelines to reinforce that TikTok is not a space for drug content and behavior.Content that promotes drug use and paraphernalia is incompatible with our commitment to providing a safe and supportive environment for our community. While we’re always working to improve the way we address any such content on platform, last year 95% of the content we removed in the US was addressed proactively, and 90% of content removals were handled within 24 hours of posting.Partnering for a brighter futureLast year at the Food and Drug Administration's Online Opioid Summit, we affirmed our commitment to working to combat online drug sales, and we're proud to partner with organizations like LegitScript and Song for Charlie that help us expand how we care for our community. Additionally, we've donated $100K in advertising credits to the Ad Council and $25K to Song for Charlie to aid their efforts in spreading awareness around the dangers of fentanyl.The CDC estimates the rates of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, increased over 16% from 2018 to 2019. We know that properly addressing the opioid crisis will take everyone coming together to prevent drug sales and connecting those living with addiction with help and resources. We're participating in National Fentanyl Awareness Day because we believe this is possible. Each day we see what impact can happen when people come together and support one another, and we're focused on achieving a world with fewer overdoses, more treatment and recoveries, and more compassion.To learn more about National Fentanyl Awareness Day, please visit here.\"We are grateful to our friends at TikTok for their support of National Fentanyl Awareness Day and for helping us to alert our youth to the dangers of fentanyl in fake pills and street drugs.

He’s known for taking people behind the scenes on his sets and sharing his creative process and unique approach to filmmaking.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?As a director and filmmaker, I feel honored to be able to tell stories of the API community and cast people on screen who look like me. Representation in media is something I feel very passionate about and I want to normalize cultures, stories and foods that aren't typically portrayed in mainstream media.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?This TikTok video is one of my favorites because I leveraged my filmmaking knowledge, while also taking people behind the scenes of a Korean series that was one of my favorite shows of 2021. The show was beautifully executed and I was happy my TikTok may have urged people to watch who may not have otherwise tuned in.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?I love cooking at home and meeting chefs who have a deep connection to the food of their culture(s).What is your favorite part about directing?Having the ability to tell a story I find important, with the people I think are best fit to do so. Often times when I've seen stories on the big screen or a commercial, I wish there were other ways that the story could've been told visually or with different talent. With directing, I get to make those decisions, trust my instincts, and share stories that might not have as much visibility. That's really special because the things we see in the media heavily influence our view on the world.What inspired you to show BTS on TikTok?I wanted to share BTS videos on TikTok for two reasons. First, as a self-taught filmmaker who didn't go to film school, I didn't have many resources available to me. I wanted to be a resource or a guide for other young filmmakers considering a career in this field. The second driver was wanting to break down the walls that were put up by Hollywood and by professional filmmakers. It was important that I show how we cast, build storyboards, put a set together, and bring a vision to life. I wanted to show people that you can be a director, food stylist, producer, actor, etc. All these people have very different backgrounds and experiences, and that's the beauty of film crews.What advice would you have for a young filmmaker?I've always heard the phrase 'fake it until you make it,' while I was growing up. But I would invite young filmmakers to 'make it until you make it.' It's easy to fake stuff on social media, and to pretend you know what you're doing. But you learn so much by actually making stuff. I got an incredible education in filmmaking once I started making my own films, learning from mistakes and growing my craft. Even if you're just making a TikTok video, that's still creation, and it allows you to make a mistake or make something incredible. The only way you can make it in films is if you put yourself out there."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-pulse-is-bringing-brands-closer-to-community-and-entertainment","date":"2022-05-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"TikTok Pulse: bringing brands closer to community and entertainment","text":"Every day we see culture created on TikTok.

Whether it’s sharing words of wisdom in her car or giving a boost of serotonin with her quirky facial expressions, you can always count on a tasty meal in front of her.What does it mean to you to be part of the API community?I didn’t feel like I belonged in the API community until just recently. I struggled with my cultural identity and was ashamed of being Asian for most of my life. I grew up in a predominantly white community and I felt like I was a white girl trapped in a Korean girl’s body. My cultural identity, balancing familial ties and cultural values, and the pressure to assimilate to mainstream American society, were a huge burden.Even though I’ve grown into a person who loves their culture and has so much self love, I still struggled with giving back to API community in an authentic way. Sharing a link or another Asian hate crime on my social channels didn’t feel personal, or like I was making an impact. So I started to post about Korean food — how I ate it, how it reminded me of my family — and it drew me closer to my culture. Eventually, my FYP became flooded with people trying Korean food. I started to share other Asian delicacies such as a Filipino Balut or Chinese century egg. Both foods were daunting to me, but sharing them in a lighthearted way allowed people around the world to discover and connect with these foods, too. I realized that my purpose was to bring a sense of humility, appreciation and comfort around Asian culture to others. That's when I felt like I belonged and represented the API community. Bringing awareness to this community is an absolute honor. I am finally proud to be Korean and bring light to something I truly love.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok is the reason why I feel safe and empowered to be my authentic self. It has given me a platform to be my loud, over expressive true self, and rewards me with a beautiful community. This community continues to remind me that we are all humans who want to be loved, food is one thing that unites us all, and having fun has no age limit. Before TikTok, I always struggled with my body image. I was trying to put myself into the mold of a fashion and lifestyle influencer girl. All my friends were finding success that way, and I was giving it my best shot. I wasn't being authentic — I didn’t eat the things I wanted, I stopped smiling in pictures, and didn't feel encouraged in that competitive space. I felt like my worth was solely dependent on how I looked in pictures and how many likes I got.But then I found TikTok, which was filled with normal people doing every day things, all while being entertaining and captivating. I was inspired by the many creators putting themselves out there. I wanted to make something out of my love for storytelling and food. I went all in! On TikTok, I never have to pretend to be something I'm not, and it's the most liberating feeling. People regularly reach out letting me know I've helped them with their eating disorders. It's empowering to know I've impacted so many people — now all I want to do is radiate love and positivity in my videos.What is your favorite TikTok video that you've created and why?My favorite video(s) are my motivational car talks. I brought myself out of very dark places through books and podcasts and I think there is comfort in hearing people overcome similar struggles. I made myself a video with lessons I have learned over time and replay it every morning like an affirmation. It brings me a sense of comfort, confidence, and relief. After posting a few of them, I noticed they touched my followers too, and I felt a sense of peace knowing that I am not the only one that needs a little pick-me-up from time to time. Knowing these videos not only brighten my day, but also positively impact others, brings me so much joy.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?Some of my passions include trying new foods, traveling, live music, fashion/beauty, photography, and animals. I only share a fraction of what I love on TikTok, but I hope to show more in the coming months. One of my heroes is Anthony Bourdain. I feel like we are both driven by our curiosity to try everything and anything. My hope is to travel and dive into different cultures around the world and share these experiences through my perspective.What's your favorite food?My number one favorite food would be sushi. Period. I also cannot live without Korean cuisine!What is your favorite restaurant?I don't have a favorite restaurant, but I love the eating out experience. I love Korean BBQ.What's the best advice you ever received?Being authentic is much more important than being popular. Once I believed this and committed to it, everything in my life fell into place and I received a lot more opportunities."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/recognizing-mental-health-awareness-month","date":"2022-05-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"Recognizing #MentalHealthAwareness Month","text":"At TikTok, we want our community to feel empowered to express themselves authentically and feel safe speaking frankly about different life experiences or challenges.

To help people forge positive digital connections in line with our rules for appropriate behavior on our platform, we strive to empower our community members to stay in control of their interactions with others on TikTok. Today we're announcing updates on our commitment to support the safety of our community and to foster kindness on TikTok, and sharing the next installment of our Community Guidelines Enforcement Report.Fostering authentic engagement in commentsAlongside our work to proactively remove abusive and hateful content or behavior that violates our Community Guidelines, we also continue to explore new ways to help our community feel more in control over comments. We've started testing a way to let individuals identify comments they believe to be irrelevant or inappropriate. This community feedback will add to the range of factors we already use to help keep the comment section consistently relevant and a place for genuine engagement. To avoid creating ill-feeling between community members or demoralize creators, only the person who registered a dislike on a comment will be able to see that they have done so.New safety reminders for creatorsTo make it easier for our community to find and use the built-in safety tools we offer, we're experimenting with reminders that will guide creators to our comment filtering and bulk block and delete options. The reminders will be shown to creators whose videos appear to be receiving a high proportion of negative comments. We will continue to remove comments that violate our Community Guidelines, and creators can continue to report comments or accounts individually or in bulk for us to review.We will update on the outcome of these tests and whether the feature will roll out in full in the coming weeks. This work is in addition to the many tools already available to our community. For example, community members can choose to filter all comments for manual review, or filter comments that contain keywords they have selected. Creators can also select who can comment on their content from Everyone, Friends (followers who they follow back) or No One. The 'Everyone' setting is not available to those below age 16.Upholding our Community GuidelinesAnother important way we protect the safety of our community is by removing content which violates our Community Guidelines, and today we released our Q4 2021 Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. This report reflects our ongoing commitment to earn the trust of our community by being accountable when it comes to keeping our platform safe and welcoming.We've continued to expand the information we provide in each report, and since the start of 2021 we've added insight into the volume of content removed at zero views, accounts removed from the full TikTok experience on the suspicion of being under the age of 13, and fake engagement. Starting with this report, we're providing information about content removals in more markets and ongoing improvements to our systems which aim to detect, flag, and, in some cases, remove violative content. These investments have helped meaningfully improve the speed at which we identify and remove violations of our harassment and bullying and hateful behavior policies in particular.From our first enforcement report in 2021 to this most recent report, we've steadfastly made progress on removing violations before they receive a single view. For instance, from Q1 to Q4 2021, removals of content at zero views improved by 14.7% for harassment and bullying content, 10.9% for hateful behavior, 16.2% for violent extremism, and 7.7% for suicide, self-harm, and dangerous acts. There's no finish line when it comes to keeping people safe, and our latest report and continued safety improvements reflect our ongoing commitment to the safety and well-being of our community. We look forward to sharing more about our ongoing work to safeguard our platform."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-for-you-paige","date":"2022-04-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: For You, Paige","text":"TikTok has become a hub for musical theater content and creatives, hosting a community that loves to celebrate and join together to create show-stopping, Grammy-award winning productions. Inspired by this thriving fanbase comes For You, Paige, a new musical commissioned by TikTok and airing LIVE on the platform on Thursday, April 14th at 7pm ET/4pm PT. Ahead of the upcoming curtain call, we sat down with some of the creative forces behind the project, including Daniel Mertzlufft (Executive Producer, Songwriter, Co-Bookwriter, Executive Music Producer, Music Supervisor, Arranger), Macy Schmidt (Co-Executive Producer, Orchestrator, Executive Music Producer), Kate Leonard (Co-Bookwriter, Songwriter, Lyricist), Sri Ramesh (Lead Actress - Paige), and Roman Banks (Lead Actor - Landon) to talk about their experience and excitement for this project, the musical theater community on TikTok, and what it takes to bring a TikTok musical to life. Live from a theater in New York City and falling under TikTok's #ProjectBroadway, be sure to tune in for For You, Paige on Thursday, April 14th at 7pm ET/4pm PT only @TikTok. How does it feel to be a part of the first live TikTok musical?Sri: It feels so cool to be a part of the first live TikTok Broadway musical. I mean, never in a million years did I think that I would get to do this, so it's very surreal.What was the inspiration behind For You, Paige?Daniel: No entertainment platform has ever fully embraced meta humor as much as the TikTok community has, so when we were brainstorming plots, I knew that we needed to live in that world. I thought of people like Blake Rouse, who wrote a song for this show, who as an actual high schooler went super viral for his songs for Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical, among countless others. This even has elements of my own experience on TikTok. My life changed after a single video, and that is not an exaggeration. So I was excited to take bits of mine and so many others' stories, and create a love letter to the entire TikTok community. I also love a good pun, so once I had the idea of the title, I sort of built the story from there.Why did you want to bring this musical to life on TikTok?Kate: There's a fun meta element to this musical because it's a TikTok musical about TikTok musicals. It's exciting to see what TikTok looks like on the outside through a story being told on the inside of the platform.Daniel: Writing this show knowing it was going directly to TikTok was both a challenge and an exciting opportunity. This isn't a show that was adapted from the stage to TikTok,or from a novel (like Utopia in For You, Paige), but because of that it meant we were able to custom write the show for the community, which opens up a whole language of humor and references that would not read in other mediums. Performing an original show live in a way that's never been done, and knowing it has the potential to be seen by over a BILLION people was enough to convince me to go on this crazy journey! What's different about writing a show for TikTok LIVE vs. a regular stage production?Macy: From a music standpoint, with a regular stage show there is not as much flexibility of what you can do with live music versus what you can do with recorded music, so it's been exciting to get to have what we have on the show. For this project, we have orchestrations for a full live orchestra, but we also have programming and all kinds of elements we get to incorportate that make this speicific to TikTok and specific to the songs that were written. I think the creative boundaries are a lot wider than they sometimes are with a stage production, which is something that is exciting for us to get to work with.What's your songwriting process? What's your favorite song that you've written for this production?Daniel: Honestly, my songwriting process changes depending on who I’m working with, and from song to song. On For You, Paige I had the opportunity to write with one of my favorite people, Kate. She is so incredible and constantly blows my mind with the brilliance of her lyrics. Each song was different though; “Playing In My Key” was mostly music first. I had the ideas all written for the verse and chorus and Kate set lyrics to those. For “Standing By” it was a whole mix where I had some music ideas but Kate had some lyric ideas so we went back and forth. It truly changes every song; it’s all fluid. It’s so difficult to pick my favorite song, but I would have to say “Playing In My Key” was really special to write. It’s a thesis on being a songwriter. Landon hears music everywhere and struggles to connect, but can escape into music. I know I can relate to that, and I’m hoping the community of amazing writers on TikTok also connect to Landon. In terms of my favorite lyrics, I adore Kate’s lyric “LOOK OUT THERE, MOMENTS ARE EVERYWHERE, READY FOR STARS THAT DARE TO ALIGN.” There is something about “Stars that DARE to align” that I just love!Kate: I wrote 3 different songs with Dan for this project and various other bits and pieces that you will throughout the show. We write differently for every song – sometimes it's music first, sometimes it's lyrics first – usually whoever writes first hands off the song without a bridge to the other person, and then the bridge is written in the opposite way. That way we can get some variation with the emotional or lyrical content of that moment. I really loved \"Beyond the Dome\" which is a song in the Utopia musical (within For You, Paige). It was written by Alex Engelberg and RJ Christian and they did an amazing job bringing that dystopian YA, #BookTok world to life.Musical theater has taken off on TikTok. Can you talk about this community and how they've found a home on the app?Daniel: The musical theater community has not only found a home, but has THRIVED on TikTok. It’s a place where it doesn’t matter who you are, or how many followers you have. Anyone from anywhere can share what they are passionate about and people will listen. The ability to connect with likeminded people is also unmatched. I’ve been able to collaborate with people from around the world who I never would have had the opportunity to meet if not for TikTok. I also still can’t believe the incredible community has enjoyed my music and my absurdist humor, and am so thankful to be a part of the community. I can’t wait for them all to see For You, Paige!Macy: My first core memories of the musical theater community on TikTok are at the beginning of the pandemic, as I'm sure many people's are. There were trickles of streamed musical theater benefits going on, but nothing like what was happening on the platform, which is why I joined TikTok. There is nothing like it in the musical theater industry, having a community of people come together and collaborate but also be properly credited and compensated for songs. I think the way everyone contributes ideas and also gets credit for those ideas, is a really revolutionary model. It wasn't lost on us that the sheer number of people that watch a LIVE musical theater show on TikTok can sometimes be the amount of people that would see a Broadway show with years of a sold out house live. It's reaching a much wider audience than we ever could with live theater, but also totally blowing up the access of who gets to contribute to that kind of work and that really excites me.What else would you want to see the TikTok community turn into a musical?Roman: I mean the Bridgerton thing was pretty cool, and they just won a Grammy for writing The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical. I just want to see things continue to be created - I think an anime musical would be cool, seeing what people do with that! I say just keep creating and what sticks, sticks and what doesn't - don't stop.What musical are you dying to see?Sri: Right now I would love to see Friends the musical (like the TV show Friends) - it's my comfort TV show!"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/effect-house","date":"2022-04-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Taking community-inspired creativity to the next level with Effect House","text":"Creative effects are part of what makes it so fun to create on TikTok. Whether you’re teleporting into new worlds with Green Screen or freeze-framing with Time Warp Scan, creative effects empower creators to express themselves, entertain, and share stories through a wide array of engaging and immersive formats.To expand what's possible with effects, we created Effect House - a platform that allows anyone to build Community Effects for TikTok. Effect House has been in closed beta since last fall, and today we're excited to open the beta to all creators, designers, and developers from around the world, inviting them to imagine new frontiers for TikTok's effects universe.Effect House offers tools and learning resources, equipping creators with intuitive design and development technologies that would empower them to build immersive and dynamic effects for TikTok's global community.Inspiring joy and creativity with Community EffectsEffect creators have already inspired a world of joy, creativity, and entertainment with the effects they have made throughout the early beta for Effect House. To date, more than 450 effect creators have published effects on TikTok, inspiring the creation of more than 1.5 billion videos and garnering over 600 billion views globally. Through the expansion of the Effect House beta, we're looking forward to seeing more of the world's creative builders develop engaging and exciting effects for our global community.Keeping safety and inclusivity at the heart of creative effectsWe're focused on fostering a safe, authentic, and inclusive environment for our global community to create and engage with effects. In addition to our Community Guidelines, effects must follow our Effect Guidelines, which outline additional policies aimed at helping everyone on TikTok feel welcome and empowered to create exactly as they are. For instance, we don't allow effects that promote colorism or negative stereotypes against protected groups, nor do we allow effects that depict cosmetic surgery, such as lip fillers, or encourage scrutiny of someone's appearance.All submitted effects will be reviewed by our Trust and Safety team to help ensure they adhere to our policies before they're released to the broader TikTok community. If we identify a violative effect, we will remove it and notify the effect's creator. While we strive to proactively identify and remove violative content, our community can also report effects they believe are not in line with our policies using the 'Report Effect' feature. If we determine an effect was incorrectly approved, we will remove the effect and videos that feature it. Or, if we see an effect being used in a way that violates our Community Guidelines, we will remove the effect and violative videos we identify that used it. Out of an abundance of caution, some effects, such as those depicting alcohol, may be ineligible to appear in the Effect Tray as we keep the breadth of our audience top of mind.Celebrating the Effect House communityTo celebrate the impact of the Effect House community and inspire future creators, we're spotlighting effect creators who are bringing their artistry, ingenuity, and creativity to life with their effects on TikTok.Laura Gouillon, @lauragouillon  Allan Gregorio, @allangregorio Grace Choi, @gracemchoi Balraj Bains, @blahblahbalraj Discover Effect HouseOn TikTok, you'll know an effect was made in Effect House by tapping the effect on a video and viewing its results page, where effect creators' profiles are linked.

With popular hashtags like #Broadway, #Musical, and #TheaterKid receiving 4.4B, 6.4B, and 574.4M global views to date, TikTok's thriving creator community has helped turn creative ideas like Grammy Award-winning album The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical into reality by providing a global stage with the potential for more than one billion fans in the audience. Now, TikTok is embarking on a new stage in redefining entertainment with For You, Paige, the first commissioned TikTok musical. Performed LIVE from a theater in New York City, For You, Paige will only be available to watch globally on @TikTok on April 14 at 7pm ET/4pm PT.Daniel Mertzlufft, the lead creative and brain behind For You, Paige is no stranger to TikTok musicals, having started the Grocery Store Musical trend (based on the viral song \"New York Summer'' by Louisa Melcher) and the wildly successful Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical (based on the song by Emily Jacobson). For You, Paige is part of TikTok's #ProjectBroadway, which celebrates and supports all things theater, musicals and Broadway; initiatives like last year's Broadway is Back featured LIVE performances from The Lion King, Waitress and Wicked, behind-the-scenes content and stage tours, as well as multiple streams of the Ratatousical which helped raise $2 million for The Actors Fund. #ProjectBroadway and For You, Paige are just a few examples of how TikTok continues to change the way people are entertained - by connecting people and communities, empowering creative expression and democratizing experiences and opportunities that may not otherwise be available.Setting the StageIn a story inspired by real TikTok creators, teenage music nerd Landon (played by Roman Banks) collaborates with his best friend Paige (played by Sri Ramesh) on a TikTok song inspired by her favorite book series. Landon’s TikTok goes viral, thrusting him into the spotlight — and leaving Paige behind. When a producer offers Landon the opportunity to adapt the book series into a musical, Landon discovers that the glory of doing it all himself isn’t worth the stress and enlists the help of Paige and the TikTok community to turn the show into a huge success. For You, Paige will also feature James Henry as Tyler, Krystina Alabado as Kaia, JJ Niemann as Jarek, and others, with songs written by Daniel Mertzlufft, Julia Riew (who recently wrote her own musical), Katherine Lynn-Rose, RJ Christian, Blake Rouse, Morgan Reilly, Alex Engelberg, Kate Leonard and Gosz & Fotos. Maria Goulamhoussen and Emily Maltby will co-direct the LIVE, with Emily and Katie Spelman choreographing and musical direction by Patrick Sulken. The score will be performed by The Broadway Sinfonietta, the acclaimed all-women and majority women of color orchestra founded by For You, Paige orchestrator Macy Schmidt. Check out #ProjectBroadway in-app for more exciting cast announcements, behind-the-scenes content, and more!Since January 2022, Daniel has been going LIVE to document the creative process behind For You, Paige, from writing and arranging songs, creating the plot, chatting with songwriters and cast, and revealing the behind-the-scenes of how a musical goes from an idea to reality. The show features numerous references to TikTok trends and communities, some of which even inspired storylines (Paige’s obsession with fictional YA series Utopia is a nod to #BookTok). With original songs like \"Playing in My Key\", \"Out of My Mouth\", and \"Beyond the Dome,\" we can't wait to see the community's creative takes on this and these songs once it's released on the platform!Tune in on April 14 at 7pm ET/4pm PT to watch For You, Paige performed LIVE in New York City, only available on @TikTok."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/join-us-in-celebrating-the-impact-of-arabtiktok","date":"2022-03-31T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Join us in celebrating the impact of #ArabTikTok","text":"Throughout the month of April and beyond, TikTok is celebrating Arab American Heritage by recognizing the contributions and impact of the #ArabTikTok community.

Last year, the IRS identified over $10 billion in losses from tax fraud and financial crimes. With Tax Day around the corner, cybercriminals may be primed to unleash a range of nefarious tactics -- whether on a connected device or a landline -- to trick people into unwittingly handing out sensitive information.Some TikTok creators are taking their expertise to #TaxTok to help others stay ahead of fraudsters that continually evolve their tactics. These Certified Public Accountants, lawyers, and fraud fighters are spotlighting ways to avoid falling victim to scams. Drawing from the IRS, along with leading experts like the Identity Theft Resource Center (@idtheftcenter_) and National Cybersecurity Alliance (@natlcybersecalliance), we're spotlighting some of our favorite tips to #BeCyberSmart this tax season.Ignore imposters – Phishing and smishing are the most common tactics used to steal personal data. The IRS will not call, text, email, or visit your home. They will not accept payment in gift cards, prepaid debit cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency. Don’t open links or attachments from suspicious senders. Scams related to COVID-19, Economic Impact Payments, and other tax law changes are increasingly common this year.Verify what you see – Fake IRS sites are scattered all over the online world. The official site is IRS.gov, and all IRS.gov web page addresses begin with https://www.irs.gov/. Beyond tax tips, if you're on e-commerce sites, ensure the web address begins with“https” – the “s” is for secure communications over the computer network. Also check for the “padlock” icon in the browser's address bar meaning there's a secure connection between the browser and the server where the website is hosted.Use secure Wi-Fi, VPN, and 2-step verification - Don't trust unsecured public Wi-Fi, especially in airplanes, airports, malls, or public transit. Use a virtual private network (VPN) whether on the go or at home, and secure home Wi-Fi networks with a strong password. This is essential as wireless printers, door locks, and refrigerators create new access points for people with bad intentions. Enable 2-step verification for an added layer of security.Have a back-up plan - Use a secure cloud service or external hard drive to copy important information, like photos and files on computers and mobile devices, as a lifeline to recover financial or other tax data if lost.Protect with a PIN - Taxpayers who can validate their identities can obtain an Identity Protection PIN, a six-digit code that prevents an identity thief from filing a fraudulent tax return using your Social Security number.Reporting potential scams helps prevent future attempts and protect others. Report IRS, Treasury, or other scam attempts to the FTC, IRS, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or Identity Theft Resource Center. If you encounter suspicious activity in-app, report it to TikTok's Safety Center, and follow @TikTokTips for more ways to #BeCyberSmart.“Whether or not you are ready for tax season, the identity criminals are, so it's a good time to remind friends and family to stay vigilant and #BeCyberSmart,” said Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center (@idtheftcenter_). \"File your taxes as early as possible, do your research before handing information over to a tax preparer, and use a secure internet connection to file online or mail it directly from the post office if you don’t.”\"What's scarier than the IRS? Someone pretending to be from the IRS,\" said PJ Rohall, Co-Founder of About-Fraud (@aboutfraud). \"Tax scammers will milk you for more money and cause more emotional damage than a lifetime of filing tax returns or interacting with legitimate IRS agents.\"\"Tax season is a haven for identity theft, so it's critical to do your due diligence before handing over personal information,\" said Gabriel Friedlander, founder of Wizer - Free Security Awareness Training (@wizersecurity). \"When it comes to tax preparation services, it's best to work with a reputable professional that comes recommended by a friend or family member.\"\"Bad actors look for any chance to accomplish their agenda of nefarious schemes, and tax season can leave the most vulnerable at risk,\" said Ian Mitchell (@ian.t.mitchell_), founder of The Knoble. \"TikTok's #BeCyberSmart initiative is a powerful step to fight back by raising awareness to prevent cybercriminals from targeting unsuspecting victims.\"\"We know how stressful tax season can be, and we're proud to partner with the IRS to share tips on how to stay safe when filing taxes this year,\" said Lisa Plaggemier, Executive Director of the National Cybersecurity Alliance (@natlcybersecalliance). \"It's critical for the TikTok community and everyone online to do research, report potential scams, and secure their online accounts.\"In partnership with our fraud awareness champions, we developed a bingo card as another fun way for people to brush up on their cybersecurity skills.

It’s skits with an authentic twist or inauthentic to get the tone right of the celebrity interviews.@straw_hat_goofy: What's going on everybody it's @straw_hat_goofy your movie guy, and in case you're wondering what exactly I do here on this app — it's quite simple, I talk about movies. I point out things you normally wouldn't see, give you recommendations and talk about some of your favorite films.How has the TikTok community inspired you?@emilyuuribe: The TikTok community has inspired me by showing me that kindness goes a long way. It’s inspiring to see other people be themselves and do it authentically. The communities built on TikTok based off of that are the coolest.@straw_hat_goofy: About two years ago I got on this app and I saw so many people doing so many creative things but the most important thing was that they were being themselves and being authentic to what they liked, and I thought \"why can't I do that with what I like?\" To this day I'm still very shocked at all the opportunities I've been allowed to have, especially hosting the red carpet at the Oscars for TikTok.We're thrilled to have you on the Oscars red carpet this year! What are you most excited for this weekend?@emilyuuribe: I am most excited for the air of celebration. ALL the nominees and talent involved, respectively, are going to be celebrating one of the hardest years of film history due to the pandemic.@straw_hat_goofy: If you're a movie fan like myself then you know that the Oscars are the biggest night of the year for movies, so I'm really excited to get on the red carpet and just kind of feel the energy of the crowd and the nominees, and see how they're feeling before the ceremonies kick off.If you had to name one Oscar nominated film (past or present) that represents you, what would that be and why?@emilyuuribe: “Once Upon a Time In Hollywood.” This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in Hollywood, it doesn’t get better than that (just no cult involved).@straw_hat_goofy: Of all the Oscar-nominated films in history I think the one that represents me most is probably \"Forrest Gump,\" because that features a character who doesn't change, but he changes everyone around him and I want to do that with everyone around me. That and \"Spider-Man 2\" with Tobey Maguire. Yeah, that one too.How would you like to grow in entertainment? what do you see as your career trajectory on and off of TikTok?@emilyuuribe: This is crazy growth within itself, as we end this cycle, I really want to flex my improv muscles more, and put in the work in the comedy space.

Since its December 24th release, Encanto videos have pervaded TikTok, resulting in five different songs from the movie trending on the platform. Composer and genius Lin-Manuel Miranda's songs have a history of resonating with countless listeners as hits from Hamilton and In the Heights spark trends and inspire creators to express themselves. The engrossing songs of Encanto are no different. In light of this success, Lin-Manuel Miranda gave a special thanks to the TikTok community for their support, creativity, and love for the Encanto soundtrack. Encanto, which takes place in Colombia and celebrates Latinx culture, music, and representation, has inspired creators to share what makes them unique and what the film meant to them. Sharing the importance of representation in film, they help educate and inspire TikTok while expressing pride in themselves and their culture. We Don't Talk About Bruno has seen the most use with over 1 million videos using the song as their soundtrack. Notable uses of the song include a recreation of the film's dance, Encanto inspired cake decorations on more than one occasion, spot on cosplays, and more. Stephanie Beatriz, the voice of Mirabel, even joined in on the fun to channel her inner Felix and Pepa. Since becoming a hit on TikTok, Lin-Manuel Miranda's soundtrack tune has become the biggest Disney animated musical success on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1995. Reaching #1 on the charts and beating out incredible songs like Frozen's Let It Go, We Don't Talk About Bruno is another example of songs reaching incredible heights with the help of TikTok creators. Dos Oruguitas -which is the soundtrack to more than 33.1k videos - is an acoustic, Spanish-language ballad and the film's Oscar contender. With a melody that pulls at listener's heart strings and message that transcends language, it's easy to see why the Academy has nominated this song for an award. Creators on TikTok have leaned into the emotional tone of the song to share heartwarming moments in their lives that - like the song - are more than likely to make your eyes misty. Artists have also featured the song as a backdrop to share the imagined stories of other characters from Encanto, using the film as a jumping off point to showcase their own talents.Beyond these two recognizable songs lie an album full of tunes that creators have rallied behind. They showcase the impact songs like Surface Pressure - currently with 169.6k creates - have on the lives of themselves and their loved ones. With hashtags like #OldestChild, #Siblings, and #OldestSister frequently being used with the song, Surface Pressure addresses family positions in a genuine, relatable way. Whether it's a family acknowledging their Louisa or a comedic take on the song's surprising impact, the song is a clear example of how Encanto's album has connected with audiences across backgrounds while sparking a moment in pop culture that has defined the beginning of 2022.The upbeat songs The Family Madriga and What Else Can I Do? - having been used 311.9k and 111.4k times respectively - are popular choices for users to flex their creativity or show love for specific characters with #EncantoCosplay and #EncantoFanArt of their favorite characters, the top three character hashtags being #Bruno, #CamiloMadrigal, and #MirabelMadrigal. Popular comedic trends surrounding the film have also sprung up with the soundtrack, including the #candle trend, where creators blow out the family candle after being treated like Mirabel was in the movie.The success of Encanto's soundtrack on TikTok has solidified the film as a cultural phenomenon and helped propel its songs to the top of the Billboard charts and a noteworthy Oscar nomination. Each song on the album lends itself to a different type of content or emotion leading to trends that range from lively, elaborate dances to emotional confessions that, like the film, will leave a tear in your eye.And since the Oscars are just around the corner — don't forget to check out trending hashtags on TikTok to show us how you’re celebrating the #OscarsAtHome.

It has also brought pain to our community and our people. And as a platform, this war has challenged us to confront a complex and rapidly changing environment as we look to be a canvas, a window, and a bridge for people across the globe.With the safety of our people and community as our guiding priority, we've dedicated significant resources to developing and enforcing new protective measures, and we want to share more on some of the steps we're taking.Piloting our state-controlled media policyLast year we began working to develop a consistent and comprehensive state media policy, as we recognize that an additional layer of context can be helpful to viewers, especially in times of war and in conflict zones. In response to the war in Ukraine, we're expediting the rollout of our state media policy to bring viewers context to evaluate the content they consume on our platform. We’ll begin piloting our policy by applying labels to content from some state-controlled media accounts over the coming days.Over the past several months we've engaged over 50 experts from multi-disciplinary backgrounds across 20 countries to inform our definition of state-controlled media – entities for which a government exercises direct or indirect control over their editorial content or decision-making – and our approach to making such designations. As we start labelling content now, we'll continue to gather feedback from experts in parallel to inform the development of our global approach and expansion. We'll share additional details on our broader policy roll out later this year. Our goal is to ensure our community has context on this type of content, and that we have the appropriate processes in place to consistently enforce the policy.Combatting misinformationWe recognize the heightened risk and impact of misleading information during a time of crisis. We continue to increase our safety and security measures and are working aggressively to help ensure people can express themselves and share their experiences, while we also seek to mitigate the potential for harm. We use a combination of technology and people to protect our platform, and our teams speak more than 60 languages and dialects including Russian and Ukrainian.Our Community Guidelines prohibit content that contains harmful misinformation, hateful behavior, or promotion of violence, and our actions to uphold these policies include removing violative content, banning accounts, and suspending access to product features like livestream. We partner with independent fact-checking organizations to aid our efforts to assess the accuracy of content so violations can be removed. Out of an abundance of caution, content that is being fact checked, and reviewed content that can't be substantiated, will be ineligible for recommendation into For You feeds.We've also evolved our methods in real-time to identify and combat harmful content, such as implementing additional measures to help detect and take action on livestreams that may broadcast unoriginal or misleading content. We remain focused on preventing, detecting, and deterring influence operations on our platform and our systems help us identify, block, and remove inauthentic accounts, engagement, or other associated activities on TikTok.Supporting digital literacy among our communityOn our Discover page, we've added digital literacy tips developed in partnership with the National Association for Media Literacy Education and MediaWise to help our community evaluate and make decisions about the content they view online. This digital literacy hub also helps viewers learn more about the many safety, security, and privacy tools available to them on TikTok, such as 2-step verification. We're also adding opt-in screens and digital literacy reminders that will appear for viewers on some videos and livestreams.The safety of our community and our people remains our priority, and we are also committing humanitarian aid, starting with a $1 million donation, as part of our continued dedication to assisting those most vulnerable in emergencies. We will continue to be responsive to events as they unfold, take action on content or behavior that threatens the safety of our platform, and dedicate resources to protecting our community.Update on March 6, 2022 at 1:15pm ETAn update on TikTok's services in Russia: TikTok is an outlet for creativity and entertainment that can provide a source of relief and human connection during a time of war when people are facing immense tragedy and isolation. However, our highest priority is the safety of our employees and our users, and in light of Russia's new ‘fake news’ law, we have no choice but to suspend livestreaming and new content to our video service in Russia while we review the safety implications of this law. Our in-app messaging service will not be affected. We will continue to evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services with safety as our top priority.Update on April 12, 2022 at 6:00am ETAn update on our actions to protect our community: As we continue our ongoing work to safeguard our platform, we wanted to share additional insights that bring further transparency to our actions. The following data reflects steps taken from February 24 - March 31, 2022.Our safety team focused on the Ukraine war has removed 41,191 videos, 87% of which violated our policies against harmful misinformation. The vast majority (78%) were identified proactively.Our fact-checking partners have helped assess 13,738 videos globally, and we've added prompts on 5,600 videos informing viewers that content could not be verified by fact checkers.We've labeled content from 49 Russian state-controlled media accounts as we pilot our new state-controlled media policy.We identified and removed 6 networks and 204 accounts globally for coordinated efforts to influence public opinion and mislead users about their identities.During this time period we also removed 321,784 fake accounts in Russia and 46,298 fake accounts in Ukraine, which removed 343,961 videos. These are ongoing actions we take to protect against fake engagement, and are not specific to accounts or content related to the Ukraine war.Update on May 20, 2022 at 6am ETAn update on our state-controlled media labels: In light of the continuing war in Ukraine, we're expanding the rollout of our labels on content posted by state-controlled media accounts to include Ukraine and Belarus while we continue working on the development of our global policy and approach beyond this pilot."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-yeahitsak","date":"2022-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @yeahitsak","text":"Hip-hop artist Akintoye Asalu, known as @yeahitsak on TikTok, is a Canadian-based creator known for his creative and relatable raps that put a groovy sound behind real-life situations. His growing popularity on the platform also inspired him to release his own music in early 2022. Check out more about Akintoye below! What does it mean to you to be part of the Black community?Being a member of the Black community means shared history. It means I don’t struggle alone in the face of white supremacy. It means that my encounters with racism and inequality are part of a shared experience, with more success stories to draw from than I can even count. It means there are people I look up to, and knowing their greatness inspires people like me. It means I know that one day, I will be able to pass that inspiration on to the next generation. It means that there will always be support from people like me because we want to see each other win.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community inspires me to continue the grind every day. Things move very fast and there are hundreds of thousands of creators who are chasing the same things I am. Being on TikTok has put me in a position to collaborate with these people and create some of the best content we’re capable of. They’ve shown me that I don’t need to do things alone — supporting one another in every way possible is the key to community success.How long does it take you to write a rap? And what’s your favorite topic to rap about?For TikTok, it typically takes anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes, on a good day. Other times, it takes me days to write a rap. I like to rap about everyday life – I feel things really deeply, even the small things. To me, everything is amplified, so I figure the best way to understand my thoughts and express them is on paper.Can you tell us the story behind the bonnet?It started during the pandemic, when the Canadian government shut everything down, including barbershops. I needed something for my hair, and my mom actually offered me her bonnet. I slept in it one night, then recorded a TikTok the next morning and it ended up being my day-to-day look.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?My biggest passion is music. I do my best to make entertaining content, but I always make sure to retain some level of musicality in anything I do. Music has become my life’s greatest obsession, and it drives everything I do. Beyond music, I’m really passionate about putting youth in positions to succeed. I’ve faced a lot of issues with access to the tools I needed to reach my potential, and I want to eliminate those barriers for the next generation.How would you like to grow in entertainment? What do you see as your career trajectory on and off of TikTok?I see my career taking me to places where my influence can become tangible. My goal is to make the best possible music and reach as many people as I can so that I can positively impact lives more directly. I hope to expand beyond music someday and branch into other forms of entertainment, like film.Once I’m in a position to reach as many people as possible, I plan to provide as many resources as possible, like putting money behind mental health services, providing access to materials and opportunities for Black youth. I plan to make the best music possible and leverage it into making people’s lives better."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-grace-africa","date":"2022-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @grace_africa","text":"Grace Amaku (@grace_africa) is an LA-based comedian, known for sharing popular impersonations, relatable stories, and POVs on TikTok.

But, the respect I have for both cultures and the recognition of my identity in both have brought me to where I am today. I gotta put on for my people!How would you like to grow in entertainment? What do you see as your career trajectory on and off of TikTok?I want to be a comedian and actress, and I quit my job and moved to LA last June to pursue that dream.

Be yourself, have fun and always remember to lift each other up."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-megagonefree","date":"2022-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @megagonefree","text":"NY-based Mega (@megagonefree) is a Black LGBTQ+ independent artist, who uses TikTok to share her positive, powerful voice and soulful melodies. As a Black woman occupying a genre without many mainstream Black voices, she aims to create music that spreads a message of love, open-mindedness, and empathy with her millions of followers. Learn more about Mega and her music below! What does it mean to you to be part of the Black community?Being part of the Black community means being part of a shared experience way bigger and older than me. Every day offers a chance to learn more about our culture and history. One person’s Black experience could be completely unique from mine, but might still share so many commonalities. Each one of us has our own unique gifts to offer our community and those differences are what make us stronger together.As much as we all share in the beauty of our culture, we also have a shared responsibility to represent and advocate for our people. That responsibility doubles for those of us blessed with these platforms of influence. I’m glad that I can use the platform I’ve built to spread the reach of our community.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has completely changed my life. The platform and its community have been there for me at my lowest moments. TikTok inspires me to be a relief for others. Comments, like “You’re my comfort account,” or “I get so happy when you come up on my FYP,” or “Your voice makes me feel so safe” reaffirm that relief. Knowing that I can spread this much positivity to millions of people motivates me to create every day.Also, I love that I can inspire so many people to follow their dreams of singing as I did! Seeing other people in my generation pursuing the same goals as me is one of the best things about the TikTok community. Where I’m from, embracing creativity and art is often frowned upon. Creating every day inspires me to change this narrative.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?Music is my greatest passion. It’s my everything and I want nothing more than to be a musician. I recently moved from my hometown to NYC in hopes of finding better music opportunities. One hobby I’m hoping to start is visiting music venues, live shows, and open mics. I’m working to build new friendships with other artists who share my passion.I’ve also grown a large passion for marketing while becoming a creator. It’s been a huge part of creating mainstream success. I spend my free time developing strategies and experimenting with social media.What are some other communities or interest groups you identify with / are a part of?I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community and a strong advocate for mental health awareness. I’m pansexual and use she/they pronouns. I feel that both of these communities are discriminated against in the Black community and one of my goals is to change that. We do not talk about mental health nearly enough with our Black youth.What is your dream opportunity?My all-time dream is to create a collaborative track with Melanie Martinez, as well as Marina and the Diamonds. They are my favorite musical artist and have molded me into who I am today. Their constant disregard for what society has to say about them is what gives me the confidence to do it myself. I would love to learn more about their creative process and reach a point in my career where I’m big enough to create with them.Another dream opportunity would be to host a meet and greet or live show for some of my supporters. It’s one thing to get support online, but seeing the support in real life would be the most amazing feeling.How would you like to grow in entertainment? What do you see as your career trajectory on and off of TikTok?I see many bright things in my future, as an entertainer, musician, and influencer. TikTok has allowed me to make so many new connections and taught me about what it means to be an entertainer. In 2022 alone, I already have plans to expand my original music discography, start touring nationwide, perform live, collaborate with other amazing TikTok creators, and expand my audience. I recently released a new song, called “Thermostat,” which I consider the start of my journey transitioning from a content creator to being a part of the music industry.I have ambitions beyond music, too, like acting and directing. My ultimate goal as a musician is to spread a message of open-mindedness and empathy. I will accomplish this by using extreme vulnerability, the safe space I create in my music and the reach that I’ve acquired through TikTok."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-immarollwithit","date":"2022-02-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @immarollwithit","text":"Next up on our Creator Spotlight series is Mya Pol, aka @immarollwithit, a sun-loving, tree-hugging, self-named \"wheelie lady\" who radiates warmth and positivity wherever she goes. As a disabled creator she shares her joy and passions through dance and sharing her experiences, all while teaching and empowering her communities with educational content. Learn more about Mya and her take on life and content creation, below. What does it mean to you to be part of the Black community?I am proud to be a member of the Black community. I see all the beauty and power I have, while recognizing the ugly presence of racism. As a Black woman adopted into a white family, I had to search for what it meant to be Black by myself, and how to connect with a community I didn’t grow up with. I went to predominately white schools where teachers and students would make comments about my hair. My natural curls were never something to be embraced. By diving into my hair journey, learning to love and nourish my curls, and wearing braids and other protective styles, I connected with more people in my community, which helped me connect with myself.I seek Black joy every chance I have. When living in a world ripe with racism, it is important to focus on and celebrate all that we have. The world is not made for people with identities like mine — my existence is resistance as a disabled Black woman and I will continue to shine.How has the TikTok community inspired you?Last year, my dog died and I was so heartbroken. After some time passed, I knew I wanted another dog but would realistically need a service dog to help with my disability. I couldn’t afford it, so I began fundraising by dancing on TikTok. It was incredible to see the massive immediate and positive response. I was able to make $20k through my GoFundMe in just a few months. The power and support from this platform blew me away. In addition, TikTok has connected me to so many amazing people. I have found other incredible advocates who inspire and educate me, and I’ve found love and support from many.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?I absolutely adore dancing on TikTok. I love adapting dances and creating new ones that feel good for my body. I also love making my educational content. Ignorance around disabilities further perpetrates harm, but I have the opportunity to educate and combat against that. I am the change I want to see in the world.Off the app, I do a lot of advocacy. I am currently campaigning for inclusion and physical access at my university by consulting with the countless administrators on campus. I also enjoy painting and playing piano. They’re fun, relaxing activities that I enjoyed before my disability began and am still able to do. I also love spending time outside, connecting with nature, and soaking in the sunshine.What are some communities you identify with?I identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and care very much about mental health. I love discussing mental health and talking about how my journey and perspective on life has enabled me to get through my disability. I also love watching TravelTok and seeing beautiful destinations. I'd love to partner with a travel agency to help them with accessible travel. I also love the dog training community on TikTok and seeing all the cute puppies out there.How can people be better allies?Listening, understanding, amplifying and supporting disabled voices in physical and actionable ways. A big issue is the lack of awareness of what disabled needs are. Do something in your community that will make real, meaningful change for accessibility. For example, call out businesses for not being accessible or having ramps."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-artbydemarcusshawn","date":"2022-02-24T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @artbydemarcusshawn","text":"Up next in our Creator Spotlight Series is DeMarcus Shawn (@artbydemarcusshawn), who uses random, every day life moments, to perfectly and hilariously reenact relatable scenarios with spot-on impersonations and POVs.

What does it mean to you to be part of the Black community?Being a part of the Black community means it’s important that I’m a positive influence for not only this community, but also to people of all races to show how we’re all extraordinary.How has the TikTok community inspired you?This community inspires me to continue creating and to not limit myself.How do you come up with ideas for your content?I’m constantly coming up with ideas. Something will come to me as we’re talking right now or it will just hit me out of the blue. I’ll also get inspiration from scrolling on TikTok. I might see a video where someone starts out with \"don't you hate when someone does this..\" and then I'll act that out in a video and tag the creator. It’s usually spur of the moment, but I'll also write things down to reference during those moments when I’m having trouble coming up with ideas.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?My passions outside of TikTok include photography, reading my Bible, working out, and making art.What has been your favorite POV that you’ve made to date?The one I recently did with my dad waking up in the morning and making a lot of noise. That man loses everything, so that POV is my favorite right now.Is there one piece of advice that you would give to comedy creators or people who are creating POV videos?Just keep creating, and take those ideas that pop into your mind and put them out there. Don't worry if somebody has experienced a particular scenario or not. I used to worry about this and I thought to myself “does everybody experience this?” and then I’d talk myself out of posting the video thinking no one will think it’s funny or relatable. But, I found that those are the videos that resonate the most with people."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/off-white-brings-paris-fashion-week-to-tiktok","date":"2022-02-24T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Off-White™ Brings Paris Fashion Week to TikTok","text":"As we walk into Fashion Weeks across the world, creators form part of a cultural moment that permeates far beyond the runway and share a one-of-a-kind fashion experience together with the TikTok community. On February 28th, Off-White c/o Virgil Abloh™ is making its TikTok debut with the first-ever multi-camera LIVE Line-Up to present Spaceship Earth an “Imaginary Experience”.This LIVE Line-Up is a first-of-its-kind experience, hosted by Unknown T, using new multi-camera features exclusive to TikTok that put users fully in control of what they see.

He is the creator of The UnCommons (an award-winning webcomic series), the founder of Weird Enough Productions (a national nonprofit), and was the first comic writer to be selected for Forbes 30 Under 30. We caught up with Tony to learn more about his career as a creator, and what he hopes to take on next! What does it mean to you to be part of the Black community?Being a part of the Black Community means having the privilege to stand on the shoulders of multiple generations of cultural innovators. Whether it’s Black writers that inspire my work, like James Baldwin, August Wilson, and N.K. Jemisin. Or, my parents, who both came from poverty, and worked to create a foundation for me to build on. Every step that I take is a part of a long path that was established long before I came along. For generations, the Black community has been a bastion of creativity, love, and perseverance. Being a part of that legacy means I get to follow in those footsteps, and carry the torch further for those that will come behind me.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The largest inspirational insight TikTok has given me is that my story matters. Before I joined the app, I was driving myself crazy trying to get somebody, anybody, to care about my stories. I believe representation matters, but at every turn I had people telling me that it didn’t. It made me feel like I was the only person who knew how powerful stories are, and how important they were to helping people realize how powerful they could be. However, the community I found on TikTok instantly surrounded me with support. I found like-minded creators, and nerds just like me, that were excited not just for my stories, but for me as a person. On TikTok I found inspiration to unapologetically share my stories, and be my true self. I found courage to just be… Tony.My username is a representation of this. It’s just my name, but that is important because for the longest time, I was afraid to be myself. With so many of my hobbies and things I liked, I would adopt usernames where nobody would feasibly be able to know that it was me. But me picking my username and having it be my actual name was a step towards embracing who I am in a way that I can't hide. It's a really simple thing, but it was a leap for me.What do you want people to take away from the stories you share? How do you want them to think and feel after they experience your content?As a writer and creator, I try to create worlds where every person can find their place. I think the world that we live in has the potential to be an amazing one, but in many scenarios, it's not very kind. And despite all the possibility, there is for us to have this amazing world, a lot of people's lived experiences don’t reflect that. It's my goal that when you read something that I wrote, or when you watch something that I made, you feel that embrace, and that moment where you can relate and just be yourself. I hope that my content is a warm embrace for people and gives them a little bit of a break from all the things that the world can throw at them.What are some of your passions on and off of TikTok?Outside of my obvious love for writing and anime, I love collecting sneakers, figurines, and playing video games. For Christmas, I collaborated with my followers to donate toys and figurines to young people in foster care. And I’m really excited about TikTok’s upcoming game streaming tools for creators!How would you like to grow in entertainment? What do you see as your career trajectory on and off of TikTok?Up until now, I’ve made a name for myself as a writer. In 2020, I signed a two book deal with MacMillan Publishing for my first series, Weirdo, a middle grade graphic novel series chronicling my youth experiences with depression and suicide. My deal made me the first Black Male Author to publish a graphic novel with the publisher since the year I was born. For me, growth means adapting my growing slate of writing projects into animated series, television shows, and films. Just like Issa Rae and Donald Glover, I would like to land an overall deal at a major streaming platform and make my ideas the next major IP franchises that become household names.On TikTok, my goal is to be an inspiring and accessible example for every young person that has a story they want to tell. I’d like to be known as “everyone’s nerdy older brother.” I want to be a quirky motivational force that helps young people find the light in dark times, and encourages them to use their stories to change the world just like I aim to do.What advice would you give to an emerging animator or creator that you know wants to do what you're doing one day?My largest piece of advice to anybody that wants to tell a story is to think about how you want people to feel when they engage with your work. How do you want someone to feel when the credits roll on your movie? How do you want someone to feel when they close the last page of your book? Because everything that you're doing is ultimately moving towards that feeling. And if you don't know what that is, you're going to lose your way, but if you keep that in the forefront of your mind as you're making and creating, it can really help, especially in those moments you experience setbacks or writer's block. If you chase that feeling, I think what you end up making is going to be something that's true to you."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-whats-next-report-2022","date":"2022-02-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"What's Next Report 2022: Insight into culture drivers on TikTok","text":"Over one billion people turn to TikTok to be entertained, to find and share joy, learn new things and to create and celebrate important moments and movements. We have learned a lot about our community, culture and how brands can play a significant role in both. From incredible SMB founders taking us inside their community, workshop and daily lives, to automotive brands creating authentic, fun TikToks to launch new products, it was a monumental year for brands on TikTok.The TikTok What's Next Report 2022 provides a deep dive into the areas we see driving real world success and impact for brands on TikTok in 2022. With 20 different iterations from around the world. The reports preview our top-performing categories, case studies to help identify ways of unlocking success on TikTok, and tips for brands looking for further inspiration. From the rise of community commerce and the importance of music to authentic partnerships with creators and continued focus on brand safety. We look forward to seeing brands drive real value for their business through creative, authentic, and culturally relevant content. In 2022.\"Our 2022 What's Next reports provide a deep dive into the areas we see driving real world success and impact for brands on TikTok around the world,\" said Sofia Hernandez, TikTok's Global Head of Business Marketing . \"From the evolution of sound, the unstoppable power of #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt and partnerships with creators, there are so many ways for businesses of all sizes to creatively engage with our community and deliver results through creative, authentic, and culturally relevant content. It's set to be another exciting year on TikTok and we look forward to sharing it with you.\"Community CommerceThe worlds of entertainment and commerce have become closely entwined. Community commerce has exploded and TikTok has became a launchpad for product discovery and brands.Sparking new shopping trends and driving cultural conversations, for products both new and old. We're continuously learning about brand, creator and community engagement on our platform.73% of people feel a deeper connection to brands they interact with on TikTok compared to others (2), with 67% saying that TikTok inspired them to shop (3) even when they weren't looking to do so.In 2021, our community loved engaging with brands and products on TikTok. A great example is Peter Thomas Roth's Instant Firmx Eye Cream, which skyrocketed in sales last August after Trinidad Sandoval - a previously unheard of creator - decided to showcase the product when sharing her daily routine on TikTok. Within 24 hours of her video going viral (which now has nearly 5.5million likes!) the eye cream flew off the shelves and sold out online across several major beauty retailers. Peter Thomas Roth even estimated that the eye cream sold what would normally sell in six months in just the first week following Trinidad's viral TikTok.2022 will be the first full year for TikTok Shopping, a suite of e-commerce tools that turn videos and LIVE into shoppable entertainment. These solutions will make it easier than ever for brands, merchants and creators to harness the power of community commerce, with tools helping them build native shopping experience, market their products, and run their e-commerce business directly on TikTok.Community commerce will continue to evolve. LIVE experiences will embrace our appetite for entertainment and new ways to discover and shop. As long as brands bring joyful entertainment to the table, we'll continue providing solutions that help brands convert interest into real-life actions.Evolution of SoundSound is integral to the TikTok experience and is changing the way we tell stories. We've seen trending songs on TikTok come from a mix of established, emerging, and breakthrough artists, spanning a range of genres as diverse as our community itself.Take for example, the case of The Backyardigans. It all started when one creator - Merlysha Pierre - decided to share songs from her childhood's favorite TV show with the TikTok community. Her post featuring the show's song Castaways went viral, kickstarting the community's adoration for The Backyardigans and sending Castaways to the number one spot on Spotify's global viral chart.TikTok music tends to transcend the platform, with 88% of people on TikTok reporting that the sound on the platform is central to the overall app experience (4). This has led people to research, stream, and buy songs they hear whilst they have been browsing the app. This not only opens up new possibilities for both artists and brands alike, but it creates a new paradigm for sharing, creating and finding music. If brands want to push the music culture forward in 2022, it's important to put the artists at the forefront of what they do and think (and act) artist-first.As well as making content on TikTok more relatable, music also generates longer watch times on average and makes people less likely to skip content. It also impacts mood, making people feel more positive. Our research with MRC Data shows that 68% of TikTok users say they remember a brand better when the brand's content uses music they like, and 58% say they feel a stronger connection to the brand. In 2022 the brands that lean into immersive audio, standing at the forefront of adopting sonic branding to create a distinctive sound will win the hearts of the TikTok community.The New Creative Dream TeamSay hello to your new creative dream team. Meet the TikTok creators: the bold personalities, cultural experts, trend-setters, and pioneers who will empower brands to overdeliver against campaign goals and get impactful and tangible results. It's time to trust in the creativity and influence of creators.Partnering with creators on TikTok boosts view-through rates for TikTok specific ads by 193%, and branded content coming from creator collabs shows a 27% higher Ad Recall (6). Even TikTok users themselves agree - 62% say that creators are the best way for brands to connect with consumers (7).Why are they so effective? Put simply, creators live and breathe TikTok, which means they have an innate understanding of their audience, cultural trends and the type of content that resonates with their unique communities. Their cultural expertise paired with a unique voice and style have likely led to an existing follower-base that's loyal, engaged, and trusting. They hold the creators' views in high regard, which makes for a powerful audience.The TikTok Creator Marketplace is the go-to destination for creator collaborations, and is a streamlined way to discover creators based on industry, budget, and business goals. Brands can also search for videos mentioning their brand in order to identify creators who already know and love their products, leading to brand integrations that feel native and authentic . On the Marketplace, brands can now connect with over 100K creators across 24 markets.We want to be there to help brands find their voice and build a meaningful community on TikTok. 2022 will see TikTok's continued investment in fresh ways for brands to embrace creativity and help them to connect and collaborate with our diverse ecosystem of creators.We've seen incredible success from creator and brand collaborations on our platform. We recently spotlighted a few campaigns in our Culture Driver list - a photographic distillation of 12 incredible marketer-creator relationships that the community loved. A great example was a campaign spearheaded by Pizza Hut, where the brand partnered with Oneya Johnson (aka AngryReactions) to give its TikTok-inspired #ForYouPizza campaign a shout out. Oneya created his own personalized pizza recipe, available in-store, and spread the word with his signature style of benevolent rage.Authentic creator collaborations deliver effective results for brands, and also inspire them to play an active role in conversations around causes such as racial equality and mental health.We're truly humbled and excited to see so many creators thrive on the platform and access new ways of working and earning their livelihood by collaborating with brands.Building for Brand SafetyOf course, while we talk about all of the trends we can expect on TikTok in 2022, our top priority as a company is to protect our community. The safety of brands on TikTok starts with keeping our community safe and secure. We believe that by prioritising the safety of our creators and community, we in turn create a positive environment for brands.We continue to demonstrate commitment to safety by introducing an array of policies, products and initiatives that reflect our ongoing dedication to the safety of the TikTok community, like age appropriate privacy and safety settings, tools to promote kindness, combat bullying and curb the spread of misinformation, as well as campaigns to promote awareness around bullying.We have listened to our brand partners and have expanded our offerings to advertisers that help ensure branded content shows up next to safe and suitable user videos. We offer four leading brand safety solutions for advertisers on TikTok - the TikTok Inventory Filter, pre-bid solutions from OpenSlate and IAS and a post-bid solution from Zefr.We have deepened and expanded TikTok partnerships, like joining the Technology Coalition, participating in the inaugural GARM Aggregated Measurement Report, taking a seat on the board of the Brand Safety Institute and becoming TAG Brand Safety Certified globally by the Trustworthy Accountability Group. Partnerships help inform our own operations and ultimately to push the industry forward for the greater good of the digital ecosystem.To keep our community informed about the steps we are taking to keep our community safe, we strive to be the most transparent and accountable company in the industry with deeper insights into our operations. In 2021 we launched our first two quarterly Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports and continued to host tours of our pioneering Transparency and Accountability Centers, as well as announced the establishment of a new physical center in Ireland to build on our two previously announced centers in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. We revamped our Transparency Center on the TikTok website to keep our community informed of our efforts in the space.There is no finish line when is comes to the safety of our community. Looking ahead to 2022 we will continue to prioritize safety, solutions for brands, transparency, and partnerships to build an even safer platform for creative expression.2022 promises to be a year like no other for brands on TikTok. From the rise of community commerce, to the proliferation of TikTok creators helping brands tell their stories in authentic ways, there has never been a better time to be a business on TikTok.A note on What's Next MethodologyTikTok For Business compiled comprehensive insights based on platform performance on TikTok, from October 2020 to October 2021. We analyzed quantitative first-party data. Our analysis revealed the categories that saw significant growth, the ones that remained amongst the most popular, and the ones which we felt deserved a special spotlight. We looked into hashtags as a reliable indicator of performance. We assigned hashtags that had a strong correlation with each category accordingly and we ranked them by volume. From this data, we took our analysis a step further by diving deeper into hashtag activity based on volume and growth. The results were insightful findings that took over each category in the past year.

With 12.3 billion global views, it's undeniable that #Hockey is gaining momentum. The @NHL on TikTok has steadily grown its account to 1.7 million followers, team accounts on the platform have amassed more than 546 million views around the world, and last year we announced our partnership with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Content like trick shots, behind the scenes and off-the-rink activities, and anything to do with sports and pets are favorites of the community.Today we announced a partnership with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Hockey League Players’ Association (NHLPA) to deliver original content and unique experiences to TikTok’s global community. The partnership will come to life in several ways, including in-ice branding and the introduction of the TikTok Tailgate Stage at two upcoming marquee outdoor NHL events – the 2022 Navy Federal Credit Union NHL Stadium Series on Feb. 26 in Nashville, Tennessee and the 2022 Tim Hortons NHL Heritage Classic on March 13 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada - featuring performances by some of the TikTok community’s favorite artists.TikTok and the NHL will work together to deliver exclusive content, including player fashion interviews, “Who Wore It Best” and “Get Dressed with the Best” segments, and other programming designed to showcase player personalities and personal styles. \"Sports content is evolving; fans on TikTok want to see an authentic and multi-dimensional side of the athletes, leagues, teams, and games they love,\" said Daniel Habashi, GM, TikTok Canada “We’re lucky to work with partners like the NHL and NHLPA who recognize this and want to bring music and fashion into the fold - two verticals that are both integral to TikTok and extremely popular with our global community.\"“TikTok is an extremely influential entertainment platform with a growing audience of Gen Z users,” said Heidi Browning, NHL Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Marketing Officer. “While highlights are among our most engaging content, through this partnership, we hope to reach the broader TikTok community with exclusive content that captures the amazing fan experience at NHL games and tentpole events, player lifestyle videos, and concerts and global livestreams.”“As the digital media landscape has continued to grow and evolve, it’s clear that TikTok has established itself as a premiere platform to connect with fans around the world,” said Mathieu Schneider, NHLPA Special Assistant to the Executive Director. “We are excited to help showcase the style, interests and engaging personalities of our Players to a large and diverse audience through this exciting partnership.”Music and entertainment are key components to the partnership, with the NHL and TikTok collaborating on musical artists for tentpole NHL events, including the 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs, NHL Stadium Series and the 2022 Tim Hortons NHL Heritage Classic.Some of the TikTok community’s favorite artists will perform at the TikTok Tailgate Stage, which will become a signature feature of the partnership. Country music star Walker Hayes, who made noise on TikTok last year with his smash hit \"Fancy Like,\" will kick off the music collaboration with a pre-game show at the 2022 Navy Federal Credit Union NHL Stadium Series on Feb. 26.

He approaches visual storytelling through the lens of powerful imagery, messages and emotions, and he has worked with brands like Netflix, Nike, and Google. We sat down with Samba to find out more about him, his content, and how he's celebrating #BlackTikTok. What does it mean to you to be part of the Black community?For me, it means a sense of pride, social responsibility and an opportunity to inspire people to be their truest self. Telling the stories of those that are underrepresented and overlooked, while pushing boundaries and expectations of what we can and cannot do.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has inspired me to try new things and be more innovative. In a fast-paced society centered around social media, staying relevant or trending is usually the number one goal. However, TikTok gave me the freedom to try new things and also share my messages with the world, all at my own pace. Creating art that can be comprehended regardless of age, language and background is my main focus, and TikTok lets me do this at scale.What are some of your passions on and off TikTok?I love filming and traveling to new places. I also enjoy playing and watching sports. I played soccer in college, so staying active has always been a huge priority for me.How would you like to grow in entertainment? What do you see as your career trajectory on and off of TikTok?On TikTok, my goal is to change the way people view storytelling. I like to share different perspectives and stories in a way that is immersive and innovative, while inspiring my community to be open to new ideas, experimenting, and creating art. Outside of TikTok, I enjoy writing and directing films. My first short film will be released early next year and I have more in the works. I would also love to build a team of artists and content creators within my production company.Is there anything you want your audience to know about you?I didn’t go to film school or have an extensive family background in film. I want people to know that if they look like me and are from the places I’ve been to, they can still be in artistic fields. It’s all about learning and being interested in art. Don’t feel like there’s a barrier — I’m just one year removed from anyone getting a camera for the first time."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-thesweetimpact","date":"2022-02-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @thesweetimpact","text":"Robert Lucas, aka @thesweetimpact, is an IT professional and self-taught cake artist who shares the process behind his cake creations on TikTok.

Learn more about Masani's approach to TikTok and content creation below! What does it mean to you to be part of the Black community?To me, being a part of the Black community means sharing a common story — a story with a rocky start that is still being written.

At the time, I was making my content for a smaller audience that knew me, but when my content went viral and it was all over TikTok, I wasn’t sure how my opinions would be received.

With over 640 billion views of #love, we're handing out virtual bouquets to passionate creators who inspire others to #LearnOnTikTok and #BeCyberSmart.In 2020, losses from romance scams reported to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) topped $304 million, climbing 50% from 2019. As a continuation of our efforts to encourage people to #BeCyberSmart alongside fraud awareness champions -- including the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), About-Fraud, The Knoble, Wiser - Free Security Training, and Frank on Fraud -- we admire TikTok creators for helping to shine a spotlight on the cruel intentions of so-called suitors that have long-plagued dating apps or other online forums.Whether in the physical or online world, the best defense against fraud is awareness. If it feels like you've been struck by Cupid's arrow, follow simple safety and security tips from experts like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), NCSA, and ITRC to protect your heart and your wallet, like:Take it slowly. Swindlers are quick to profess their affection and take conversations off apps. They often try to draw in victims with love-filled texts, emails, or calls. A best practice is to vet your new heartthrob by asking questions, and pay attention to inconsistencies that may reveal your crush as an impostor.Keep your funds (and personal information) to yourself. If you've never met in person, don't send or exchange money via gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency, and don't share personal details like bank account, home address, or other sensitive information.Don't play games. Tools like images.google.com can help conduct a reverse image search of someone's online profile photo. If results show the same photo on another site but with a different name attached, a scammer may have stolen it. For sweet emails or text messages that sound too good to be true, copy and paste the text into a search engine to see if others have already encountered this potential fraudster.Listen to your heart, follow your head. If something seems amiss, cut off all contact immediately. Fraud, scams, and bad business practices can also be reported to the Federal Trade Commission, FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), and IRS Taxpayer Guide to Identity Theft in the US, along with Action Fraud in the UK. If you encounter suspicious activity in-app, report it to TikTok's Safety Center, and follow @TikTokTips for more ways to #BeCyberSmart.\"Roses are red, violets are blue, but romance scammers are out to get you,\" said Gabriel Friedlander, founder of Wizer - Free Security Awareness Training. \"Romance scams are the worst. On top of losing money, victims also experience the grief of a breakup, and that combination can be traumatizing financially and emotionally.\"\"There's no shame in falling in love with someone who lied to you about their identity,\" said Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. \"Victims of romance scams tend to think others see them as gullible or naïve, but it's important for people to feel supported and comfortable to reach out for help and report these crimes.\"\"Romance scams often aren't taken as seriously as other types of fraud,\" said PJ Rohall, About-Fraud Co-Founder. \"It's a growing problem committed by sophisticated criminals who groom and use psychological manipulation to victimize people who are genuinely looking to make connections and develop relationships. It’s critical for fraud fighters to join together in educating our communities about the biggest warning signs.\"\"There are plenty of fish in the sea, but there are a lot of sharks out there too,\" said Frank McKenna, Point Predictive Co-Founder and author of FrankonFraud. \"If you meet someone online and they won't video chat or meet in person - or especially if they ask you for money - those are all huge romance scam red flags. When in doubt, get a second opinion from someone you trust.\"\"People may not realize that scammers are often part of larger, international criminal networks that aim not only to extort money from their victims, but also to use those victims as unknowing 'money mules' or to take part in malicious activity like ransomware attacks,\" said Ian Mitchell, The Knoble Founder. \"Industry professionals must come together to protect the innocent from becoming victims.\"\"Many people have experienced isolation and loneliness these past few years due to COVID-19 lockdowns, turning to online to find human connection,\" said Lisa Plaggemier, National Cybersecurity Alliance Executive Director. \"Scams have become incredibly complex, and it's easy to miss the red flags before it's too late.\""},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/strengthening-our-policies-to-promote-safety-security-and-wellbeing-on-tiktok","date":"2022-02-07T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"Strengthening our policies to promote safety, security, and well-being on TikTok","text":"By Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and SafetyToday we're announcing updates to our Community Guidelines to further support the well-being of our community and the integrity of our platform. Transparency with our community is important to us, and these updates clarify or expand upon the types of behavior and content we will remove from our platform or make ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. We routinely strengthen our safeguards so that TikTok can continue to bring people together to create, connect, and enjoy community-powered entertainment long-term.Building a safe and secure entertainment platformAt TikTok, we believe people should be able to express themselves creatively and be entertained in a safe, secure, and welcoming environment. Our Community Guidelines support that by establishing a set of norms so that people understand what kinds of content to create on our platform and viewers know what to report to us. Our policies are designed to foster an experience that prioritizes safety, inclusion, and authenticity. They take into account emerging trends or threats observed across the internet and on our platform. We also listen to feedback from our community, our US Content Advisory Council, and other experts in areas like digital safety and security, content moderation, health and well-being, and adolescent development.Some of the main updates we're announcing today and implementing over the next few weeks include: Strengthening our dangerous acts and challenges policy. We continue to enact the stricter approach we previously announced to help prevent such content - including suicide hoaxes - from spreading on our platform. This previously sat within our suicide and self-harm policies, but will now be highlighted in a separate policy category with more detail so it's even easier for our community to familiarize themselves with these guidelines. As part of our ongoing work to help our community understand online challenges and stay safe while having fun, we've worked with experts to launch new videos from creators that call on our community to follow four helpful steps when assessing content online - stop, think, decide and act. Community members can also view these videos at our #SaferTogether hub on the Discover page over the next week.Broadening our approach to eating disorders. While we already remove content that promotes eating disorders, we'll start to also remove the promotion of disordered eating. We're making this change, in consultation with eating disorders experts, researchers, and physicians, as we understand that people can struggle with unhealthy eating patterns and behavior without having an eating disorder diagnosis. Our aim is to acknowledge more symptoms, such as overexercise or short-term fasting, that are frequently under-recognized signs of a potential problem. This is an incredibly nuanced area that's difficult to consistently get right, and we're working to train our teams to remain alert to a broader scope of content.Adding clarity on the types of hateful ideologies prohibited on our platform. This includes deadnaming, misgendering, or misogyny as well as content that supports or promotes conversion therapy programs. Though these ideologies have long been prohibited on TikTok, we've heard from creators and civil society organizations that it's important to be explicit in our Community Guidelines. On top of this, we hope our recent feature enabling people to add their pronouns will encourage respectful and inclusive dialogue on our platform.Expanding our policy to protect the security, integrity, availability, and reliability of our platform. This includes prohibiting unauthorized access to TikTok, as well as TikTok content, accounts, systems, or data, and prohibiting the use of TikTok to perpetrate criminal activity. In addition to educating our community on ways to spot, avoid, and report suspicious activity, we're opening state-of-the-art cyber incident monitoring and investigative response centers in Washington DC, Dublin, and Singapore this year. TikTok's Fusion Center operations enable follow-the-sun threat monitoring and intelligence gathering, as we continue working with industry-leading experts to test and enhance our defenses.Additionally, our community can find more information about the content categories ineligible for recommendation into For You feeds. While the ability to discover new ideas, creators, and interests is part of what makes our platform unique, content in someone’s For You feed may come from a creator they haven’t chosen to follow or relate to an interest they haven’t previously engaged with. That’s why when we come across content that may not be appropriate for a general audience, which includes everyone from teens to great-great-grandparents, we do our best to remove it from our recommendation system.Every member of our community will be prompted to read our updated guidelines when they open our app in the coming weeks.Staying accountable to our communityThe strength of a policy lies in its enforceability. Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and all content on TikTok, and we strive to be consistent and equitable in our enforcement. We use a combination of technology and people to identify and remove violations of our Community Guidelines, and we will continue training our automated systems and safety teams to uphold our policies.To hold ourselves accountable to our community, NGOs, and others, we release Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports quarterly. Our most recent report, published today, shows that over 91 million violative videos were removed during Q3 2021, which is around 1% of all videos uploaded. Of those videos, 95.1% were removed before a user reported it, 88.8% before the video received any views, and 93.9% within 24 hours of being posted. We continue to expand our system that detects and removes certain categories of violations at upload – including adult nudity and sexual activities, minor safety, and illegal activities and regulated goods. As a result, the volume of automated removals has increased, which improves the overall safety of our platform and enables our team to focus more time on reviewing contextual or nuanced content, such as hate speech, bullying and harassment, and misinformation.We've made significant strides to improve our policies and enforcement, including our efficacy, speed, and consistency, though we recognize there's no finish line when it comes to keeping people safe. We're driven by our passion to help everyone have a good and enriching experience on TikTok."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/celebrating-blacktiktok","date":"2022-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Celebrating #BlackTikTok","text":"We're kicking off Black History Month in celebration of #BlackTikTok, an industry-defining community that is continuously originating, trailblazing, and trendsetting.

This includes executive leadership videos, expert panel discussions with external speakers, and providing our employees with easy-to-digest tips to help them keep privacy front and center in everything they do.Educating our CommunityWe know that people are the most creative on TikTok when they feel safe and secure on our platform, and a big part of that is our community feeling they can trust us with their information.That's why we use our Safety Center and in-app videos on @TikTokTips to help our community understand how we keep their data safe, as well as the privacy options available to them, like making their account private, or turning off Stitch and Duet, so they can create the TikTok experience that they are most comfortable with.Privacy at TikTokPrivacy is built into TikTok by design so that our community can confidently discover, create, and enjoy entertaining content.By placing privacy at the heart of how we build our platform, we empower people with meaningful choices over the information they choose to share on our app, and we protect that information with world-class security practices. Our community has access to a wide-range of privacy settings, for example:Choosing whether their account is private or publicChoosing how we suggest their account to othersSetting limits on who can interact with their videos, through features like Stitch and Duet, or who can comment on their videosSelecting who can tag and mention a user in a post, all the way from 'Everyone' to 'No One'Privacy is a never-ending journeyOur work on privacy is certainly not confined to a single day or month - it's core to what we do every day. That's why we're constantly adding new options to how people can manage their TikTok experience and new features to improve transparency. Last year alone, we have:Made an industry leading change to set accounts under age 16 to private by default, meaning any new or existing account on TikTok was automatically set to private.Launched new Transparency and Accountability Centers. These provide an opportunity for third-parties, experts and stakeholders around the world to examine our moderation policies, understand how our algorithm works, see how we moderate content on a daily basis and understand how our privacy and security practices work. We currently have Transparency and Accountability Centers in the United States and Europe.Rolled out additional protective measures for teens including changing default DM settings for 16 and 17 year olds to ‘No One’, limiting push notifications and proactively asking teens to set privacy settings when they upload their videos.Privacy is a priority all year round at TikTok, and we look forward to using this month to celebrate the importance of data protection, and ensure that we're living up to the high standards our community rightly expects"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/commemorating-holocaust-remembrance-day","date":"2022-01-26T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"Commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day","text":"By Eric Ebenstein, Director, Public Policy and Elizabeth Kanter, Director, Government RelationsCommunities around the world today mark Holocaust Remembrance Day by commemorating the victims of the Holocaust and the liberation of the Nazi concentration and death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1945. The day calls on each of us to reflect on the Holocaust and other genocides, and to educate ourselves to help prevent future atrocities.Education is one of the most powerful ways to counter hate. So to mark this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day, and building on our continued work, we're partnering with the World Jewish Congress (WJC) and UNESCO to provide our global community with easy access to educational resources all year round so they can learn more about the Holocaust, the Jewish community and antisemitism. Helping our community access authoritative information on the HolocaustStarting today, if people search for a term related to the Holocaust – such as 'Holocaust victims' or 'Holocaust survivor' – they will see a banner at the top of the search results page that prompts them to visit aboutholocaust.org to learn more. For community members who search for terms related to the Holocaust that violate our Community Guidelines, we'll continue to block search results and additionally display this banner to direct them to the WJC and UNESCO educational resources.We will also add a permanent public service announcement directing our community to the aboutholocaust.org website to a collection of hashtags. These hashtags are currently widely used by our community to share educational content related to the Holocaust and Jewish people, including #HolocaustSurvivor and #HolocaustRemembrance.In the coming months we will introduce a permanent banner at the bottom of videos discussing the Holocaust which redirects people to aboutholocaust.org. The banner will be displayed when a community member posts a video with hashtags related to the Holocaust in the video description. This will give our community another easy access point for authoritative information, for example in the event that they come across Holocaust-related content on their For You feed.“The World Jewish Congress is proud to partner with UNESCO and TikTok in making factual and reliable information about the Holocaust available to the TikTok community. TikTok allows us to reach a new audience, some of whom may be uninformed about the horrors of the Holocaust and therefore be potentially susceptible to misinformation. We welcome the platform taking responsibility and leveraging its reach to stop the spread of antisemitism and Holocaust denial.” - Ronald S. Lauder, President, World Jewish Congress\"Denying, distorting or trivializing the true facts of the Holocaust is a pernicious form of contemporary antisemitism. We welcome TikTok’s commitment to act with UNESCO and the WJC. All online platforms must take responsibility for the spread of hate speech by promoting reliable sources of information.” - Audrey Azoulay, Director-General, UNESCOInviting our community to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance DayIn addition to these product changes, we're inviting our community to learn more about the Holocaust via our in-app Discover page. From our Discover page, our community can hear firsthand from creators who are teaching about the Holocaust, sharing tips on how to be a good ally, and raising awareness of the dangers of antisemitism.Countering antisemitism on TikTokHateful behavior of any kind is incompatible with our values and the inclusive environment we are building at TikTok. We condemn antisemitism in all its forms and deploy a combination of technologies and moderation teams to remove antisemitic content and accounts from our platform, including Holocaust denial or any other form of hate speech directed at the Jewish community.We're proud to be taking these steps as we work to deliver on the commitments we made last year at the Malmö International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism, where we pledged to put our full strength behind keeping TikTok a place that is free of hate, and to harness the power of our platform to educate our community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-editing-tools","date":"2021-12-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"A guide to the newest editing tools on TikTok","text":"At TikTok we believe that you shouldn't need to be a pro at video editing or an award-winning film-maker to make easy, eye-catching and entertaining content. Easy and intuitive tools empower people to express their creativity without limits. From experienced editors to those making their first video, we're excited to offer a wide range of tools for every level of creator.To do this, we've made some updates to our camera and editing tools, introducing new features in Green Screen, one-tap video enhancements, new sound effects, and more.GIPHY in Green ScreenGreen Screen is one of our community's most used effects on TikTok, and we're taking things to a new dimension with the introduction of green screen GIFs. In partnership with GIPHY, users can now select from a library of GIFs to apply as their background when they use the Green Screen creative effect. Whether looking for the perfect reaction GIF or showcasing an iconic meme, GIPHY in Green Screen unlocks exciting new opportunities for creativity and storytelling.One-tap visual enhancementLike waving a magic wand, the new Visual Enhancement button will improve exposure, low-light, and color correction instantly.

To undo the enhancement, tap the \"Enhance\" button again.New musical and animal voice effectsWe're putting state-of-the-art music synthesis tools in the hands of all TikTok users. But wait, what does that even mean? With our latest update, people can make any sound or voice from their videos sound like an animal or musical instrument. New for TikTok, people can make their sound mimic a cat's meow or flute's and suona's melody.We're looking forward to developing this tool further and adding more sound effects. For now, we're excited to see how people make the effects shine - maybe we'll see more recreations of Cats the Musical? Whatever it is, \"flute\" for the stars! Record your video and then on the Editing page tap the \"Voice Effects\" button on the right panel. Select from one of the three new options to transform the audio in your video to sound like a suona, flute, or cat.High Quality UploadingOne thing is crystal clear: creativity deserves high-def treatment.

From cat sounds and video editing to HD videos and GIFs galore, we're excited to see all the ways that our community uses these tools to create memorable, engaging, and inspiring content."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations","date":"2021-12-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"An update on our work to safeguard and diversify recommendations","text":"TikTok is a place to create, discover, and watch entertaining videos, and we're proud to be a home where our diverse community of creators can express themselves. Our goal is to foster an environment where people feel safe and supported being exactly who they are, whether they're creating videos for our community or watching them.Our approach to the For You feedThere are many ways to discover and view videos on TikTok, and the For You feed is part of what enables people to explore a diversity of ideas, creators, and interests. Our system considers a range of engagement signals, such as likes, follows, and videos watched, to show people other videos they might be interested in. This is similar to streaming services which suggest new artists or movies based on the songs someone has listened to or films they've watched.To keep people's For You feeds fresh – and interrupt repetitive patterns – our recommendation system works to intersperse diverse types of content along with those people already know they love. Our community tells us they love finding creators they wouldn't have known to follow, or learning about a new interest because it was recommended to them, along with enjoying content that already matches their taste.However, certain kinds of videos can sometimes inadvertently reinforce a negative personal experience for some viewers, like if someone who's recently ended a relationship comes across a breakup video. We want to share more about some of the work underway to address this and improve the experience for viewers on TikTok.Diversifying recommendationsAt TikTok, we recognize that too much of anything, whether it's animals, fitness tips, or personal well-being journeys, doesn't fit with the diverse discovery experience we aim to create. That's why our recommendation system works to intersperse recommendations that might fall outside people's expressed preferences, offering an opportunity to discover new categories of content. For example, our systems won't recommend two videos in a row made by the same creator or with the same sound. Doing so enriches the viewing experience and can help promote exposure to a range of ideas and perspectives on our platform.As we continue to develop new strategies to interrupt repetitive patterns, we're looking at how our system can better vary the kinds of content that may be recommended in a sequence. That's why we're testing ways to avoid recommending a series of similar content – such as around extreme dieting or fitness, sadness, or breakups – to protect against viewing too much of a content category that may be fine as a single video but problematic if viewed in clusters.We're also working to recognize if our system may inadvertently be recommending only very limited types of content that, though not violative of our policies, could have a negative effect if that's the majority of what someone watches, such as content about loneliness or weight loss. Our goal is for each person's For You feed to feature a breadth of content, creators, and topics.This work is being informed by ongoing conversations with experts across medicine, clinical psychology, and AI ethics, members of our Content Advisory Council, and our community.A new way to shape what you seeAs we build safeguards into TikTok by design, we also want to empower people with more choices to customize their experience to their own preferences and comfort. For example, we're working on a feature that would let people choose words or hashtags associated with content they don't want to see in their For You feed. We already enable people to tap any video and select \"Not interested\" to automatically skip future videos from that same creator or using the same audio. This new tool will offer another way to help people customize their feed – whether for a vegetarian who wants to see fewer meat recipes, or someone working on self-esteem who would rather see fewer beauty tutorials.Building safety into recommendationsTikTok's For You feed is designed to help people discover original and entertaining content, and we have a number of safeguards in place to support this aim. In addition to removing content that violates our Community Guidelines, we try not to recommend certain categories of content that may not be appropriate for a general audience. Our safety team takes additional precautions to review videos as they rise in popularity to reduce the likelihood of content that may not be appropriate for a general audience entering our recommended system.Looking aheadGetting these systems and tools right will take time and iteration. We'll continue to look at how we can ensure our system is making a diversity of recommendations. And we're committed to bringing transparency to this work and how our system operates more broadly, including at our global Transparency and Accountability Centers where we dive even deeper into the mechanics of our recommendation engine. As we learn or make progress, we'll share updates along the way."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/longer-video-creators","date":"2021-12-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Creators changing the game with longer videos on TikTok","text":"When we first introduced the option to create longer videos, we were excited to see how the added time would inspire richer storytelling and entertainment on TikTok.Videos longer than one minute receive over 5 billion views globally, and we've been blown away by our community's creativity as it's shared longer-form content of all kinds - from podcasts to vlogs, to cooking tutorials, fashion commentary, and more.Creators have made ongoing series of their longer content, too - some packaging episodes into Playlists and sharing deeper-dives into their lives, with quality content that keeps us entertained.Today we're highlighting creators who are making great use of the added time, using every extra minute to share more nuanced stories, connect deeply with audiences, and express themselves in unique and meaningful ways.Charles, @charlesgross  Having built a community on TikTok around thoughtful perspectives on fashion, beauty, and lifestyle, Charles is charting a path with content that informs, educates, and entertains. Charles uses the space afforded by longer videos to share style tips, offer personal takes on hot topics, and host deep-dives on emerging trends. With the signature catchphrase, \"Let's talk about it,\" Charles invites viewers to conversation.On Charles's TikTok journey:\"I have been creating on TikTok consistently since the beginning of 2021, and what truly excites me is the positive and uplifting community that has grown around my content. I love to create educational but personal content with the main through line being positivity, transparency, and authenticity on fashion, lifestyle, and beauty. I love my supporters so much, and my goal is always to create content that excites both of us and sparks conversations.\"What are the stories you're telling on TikTok?\"I weave the stories of my life and what has led me to where I am into every video. But overall, I want to break down walls and pop bubbles in the world of luxury fashion, bringing information and insights to the forefront.\"On creating longer videos:\"Longer format TikToks have been integral in my storytelling. Three minutes is a perfect, almost magical time format to convey a message while staying true to shortform. That overlap has been amazing in helping me create some of my favorite TikToks. My audience is truly the most positive and loving force. And they have been so incredibly supportive of my longer TikToks. Some of which have been my best performing videos.\" Ana, @saltycocina Ana's videos keep viewers coming back for serving after serving. With friendly, step-by-step explanations of delicious home recipes, Ana's captured the hearts (and appetites) of foodies, experienced chefs, and new cooks alike. Ana's longform videos feel like episodes in a chef's miniseries, and with playlists like \"Breakfast\" and \"Side Dishes\" that package videos by category, viewers can sit back and savor every bite.On Ana's TikTok journey:\"I first started using Tiktok in February of 2021, and it has been an incredible journey. I originally started creating TikTok videos for my kids and family, but since I had such an incredible response, I began to share more and more for everyone to enjoy! With the pandemic in full swing, the future was so unclear so just in case something happened to me my kids would have all their favorite recipes to refer to on video with a step-by-step tutorial on how to prepare each recipe.\"On creating longer videos:\"I do have to say that when they announced longer videos, I was beyond excited. With longer videos, I could take my time to better explain each recipe. My original goal was to leave these videos for my kids and grandkids, but now I want to take this to the next level and create a name for myself.\"Why Ana loves making content:\"My content is definitely educational in creating simple and delicious recipes for all food lovers! The phrase if you do something you love, you will never have to work a day in your life, which is what I am doing now!\" Andrew, @blvcklyst  When it comes to highly-engaging, educational content, Andrew's pushing the limits of what's possible. With a documentary-style series called \"Black Brilliance on the B-Side,\" video commentary, and a virtual gameshow, \"Black Brilliance Game Show,\" Andrew's informative, longform content teaches, fosters awareness around important topics, and inspires an ever-growing audience on TikTok.What excites you most about creating on TikTok?\"Educating people about Black brilliant people in American history and the community you build is awesome!\"What are the stories you're telling on TikTok?\"Most of my videos are sharing brilliant Black people in American History (inventors, scientists, actors, dancers, business people, freedom fighters, historic activists and so on).\"Why do you make videos on TikTok?\"One - To educate and inspire Black people about the brilliance they have contributed to the world and it has been a pleasant surprise that other races and cultures have been excited about Black brilliance.Two - To educate and offer Black people an opportunity to begin building wealth in their communities via financial literacy and business investments.Three - I have a gameshow to entertain my community (Black Brilliance Game Show) which is attached to a live show follow-up.\" Frank, @frankmichaelsmith From stories about legendary sports heroes to surprising science facts, Frank’s videos cover all kinds of fascinating topics. With well-researched deep-dives that are made like mini documentaries, Frank shares stories that entertain, inspire, and teach people something new every time they press play. With more time to share those stories, Frank’s videos are filled with all the more information, background, and detail that audiences look for and enjoy.On Frank's TikTok journey:\"I've been creating on TikTok since April of 2020. What excites me most is the fashion in which TikTok rewards quality video. It's what allowed me to grow in the first place.\"How would you describe your content?\"I prefer the words \"video\" or \"art\" instead of content. I don't take offense to it, but storytelling is an art form. I describe my work as high quality, entertaining, informative, and digestible.\"On creating longer videos:\"I started publishing longer videos as soon as the feature became available. Oftentimes when I edit, the video comes out to anywhere between 60 and 70 seconds. Rather than subtracting key scenes, longer videos affords me the ability to tell my stories in full. My longer videos perform just as well, if not better than my other videos. If I had to guess, I'd say most of the time my audience doesn't even notice they're longer - which is what we're going for!\" Now that we've seen a little of what's possible when creators have time to experiment with longer content, we're encouraging creators around the world to try new things with content that would benefit from some more time on the clock.We continue to be inspired by creators who have perfected the art of longer content, and we're excited to see all the ways people use longer formats to entertain, share meaningful stories, and bring joy to our global TikTok community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-music-report-2021","date":"2021-12-12T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Year on TikTok 2021 Music Report","text":"Music is at the heart of the TikTok experience. It's the glue that connects TikTok's disparate threads, providing a throughline between individuals and communities who bring their own spin to the latest trend. In turn, TikTok occupies a central place in the creation, consumption, and interpretation of modern music. TikTok is a playground where artists and creators can interact, combining their unique sensibilities and talents to propel trends to the forefront of culture. Stars can preview new songs to a legion of hungry fans, who jump at the opportunity to create content inspired by a musical element or favorite lyric.After turning heads in 2020, TikTok continued its tremendous growth to be a dominant force in music and the music industry in 2021. Approximately 430 songs surpassed 1 billion video views as TikTok sounds in 2021–a threefold increase over 2020. The most popular of these songs approach, and even exceed, 20 billion views on videos they soundtrack. The staggering view counts on TikTok do not exist in a vacuum, but directly translate to commercial success for trending songs and artists. Over 175 songs that trended on TikTok in 2021 charted on the Billboard Hot 100, twice as many as last year.“TikTok opens the door to new artists, new sounds, underground and DIY scenes as well as the classic hits, connecting them with a global audience and passionate music community like never before. 2021 has been a huge year for music and for TikTok and we’ve been humbled how the industry and so many artists have partnered with us to make this magic happen across so many different countries.From the Beatles to Sea Shanties, J Balvin to Abba and of course who can forget Taylor Swift's entry - the last 12 months have provided so many music moments, inspired our community of one billion and shown the world that music starts and lives on TikTok”-- Ole Obermann, Global Head of Music, TikTokTrends on TikTok open doors to underground and DIY scenes like Hyperpop and Glitch Hop, exposing them to a global audience. TikTok saw trending songs from dozens of countries, and from every continent. The map here only touches on a fraction of TikTok's global impact.TikTok remained the top source of music discovery for fans of all backgrounds. The platform paved the way for the next generation of music stars, helping usher artists as diverse as Olivia Rodrigo, PinkPantheress, and Måneskin to stardom.For our second annual music report, we decided to take an in-depth look at what music makes TikTok tick. We'll explore the biggest songs and the most popular trends, but we'll also take a peek under the hood to reveal some of our favorite music moments, and to explore how artists and creators used TikTok's most unique features. And if there's one thing that 2021 proved, it's that any music, and we mean anything, from kids music to baile funk to sea shanties, can break through and become a culture-driving trend. Things got weird.So to quote one of TikTok's least likely, but most popular trending songs: \"on and on we push...into the thick of it!\" (Admit it...you're singing it in your head right now!)'Cause I Am Me: Emerging Artists of the YearTikTok is home to a voracious community of music mavens, always on the hunt for the next big thing. According to a recent MRC Data study, 75% of TikTok users in the U.S. say that they use TikTok to discover new artists, and 63% say that they hear music that they've never heard before for the first time on the platform. It's the ideal platform for exciting new artists to find and build an audience, without sacrificing creative autonomy or compromising their authenticity.Following in the footsteps of artists like The Kid Laroi, Tai Verdes, and Tate McRae, who made TikTok's list of Emerging Artists in 2020 and had banner years in 2021, these artists used TikTok to raise their profiles in a major way this year.The artists are presented in alphabetical order.Amaarae (Ghana/US) - Fusing R&B and Afrobeats into a one-of-a-kind mix, the Ghanaian-American singer-songwriter scored her first ever Hot 100 hit after \"SAD GIRLS LOVE MONEY\" (Remix) ft.

India, The Netherlands, and France), and reaching #2 on Billboard's Global 200 songs list.Cochise (US) - After breaking out last year with his song \"Hatchback,\" Cochise proved his staying power with his addictive hits \"Tell Em\" ft. $NOT and \"Knicks.\"Coi Leray (US) - Coi loves to show off her playful personality on her account (8.8 million followers), which helps boost her hits like the massive \"TWINNEM,\" her breakout \"No More Parties \"(eventually graced with a Lil Durk remix), and her NSFW verse on BfB Da Packman's \"Ocean Prime.\"Doechii (US) - Introducing herself with her bold and brash \"YUCKY BLUCKY FRUITCAKE,\" Doechii inspired hundreds of thousands of TikTok users to flaunt their glowed-up selves to the tune of her song.Eyedress (Philippines) - Eyedress's hazy and heartfelt “Something About You” ft. Dent May provided the perfect soundtrack for users who wanted to express love for a special someone–including Eydress himself, who revealed the inspiration for the song on his own account.Feid (Colombia) - A rising star in the world of reggaeton, Feid repaid his loyal fans on TIkTok when he released \"Vacaxiones\"–a song TikTok has been clamoring for ever since Feid unveiled a snippet last year.Jay Wheeler (Puerto Rico) - With over 4.4 million followers, part of a massive and growing fanbase that gave him the nickname La Voz Favorita, Jay Wheeler is one of the most popular ascendant Latin stars on TikTok.Kali (US) - The rising Atlanta rapper inspired TikTok creators to coyly answer questions about themselves with her hit song \"MMM MMM\" (842k video creations), which eventually earned a remix featuring Latto and Moneybagg Yo.Magdelena Bay (US) - Captivating with their unique, early-digital aesthetic and their sugar-coated shoegaze pop, California duo Magdalena Bay built a loyal TikTok following with cute sketches, music industry explainers, and of course, great music.Måneskin (Italy) - Italy's finest rock band conquered the globe in 2021 with the help of TikTok-trending hits like \"Beggin'\" (10m+ creations), \"MAMMAMIA,\" and more.Navos (UK) - Based in Liverpool, this rising DJ inspired one of the year's funniest dance crazes with his house anthem \"Believe Me.\"PinkPantheress (UK) - The mysterious, DIY pop star mesmerized the TikTok community by combining deftly sweet melodies with nostalgic samples of UK club bangers.RealestK (Canada) - Trending on TikTok with his song \"WFM\" (which earned a co-sign from GIVEON), the Toronto teenager is one of the most promising voices in his city's deep R&B scene.Saucy Santana (US) - Making waves as both an artist and a TikTok creator, Saucy Santana's songs inspired a universe of memes and even more dances.Shygirl (UK) - An rapper, producer, and DJ from South London, Shygirl made a major impact when her banger \"Uckers\" soundtracked videos of glow-ups and shocking transformations.TisaKorean (US) - There's nothing TisaKorean can't do–he can rap, dance, produce, and even model his new Puma slides. Trending is as easy as drinking water (or mopping a floor?) for the boisterous Houston native.YungManny(US) - Maryland teenager YungManny is a promising rapper with a certified TikTok smash in \"Clap For Em\" ft. Sada Baby & Flo Milli, but he's also a prolific and frequently hilarious creator on his own account.Clap For Em: Artists by Catalogue Creations New year, same queen: after racking up the most catalog video views of any artist in 2020, Megan Thee Stallion, first of her name, reigneth once again in 2021. The Houston-born rapper excels at crafting quotable songs with a danceable bounce, and always provides a smile with her amiable presence as @TheeStallion on TikTok. Songs like \"Cognac Queen,\" \"Thot Sh*t,\" and \"Cry Baby\" kept her in the number one spot for the second straight year.Beyond Megan, you'll find a familiar #2: Doja Cat, who placed second in last year's list. After scoring multiple TikTok trending hits from her 2019 album Hot Pink, Doja repeated the feat with her 2021 project Planet Her, home to songs like \"Kiss Me More\" (TikTok's #4 most-viewed song in the U.S.), \"Get Into It (Yuh),\" and \"Woman.\" Like Megan, Doja is active on TikTok, showing off her offbeat sense of humor and interacting with fans.Beyond the repeat champ and vice champ, the list of Top Artists by Catalog is home to plenty of artists who broke out in a big way in 2021, notably Olivia Rodrigo, whose TikTok-trending single \"drivers license\" garnered the biggest Spotify debut week in history. Throughout the list, emerging artists rub shoulders with superstars, with established stars like Drake and Kevin Gates rubbing shoulders with upstarts like Coi Leray, whose \"TWINNEM\" and \"No More Parties\" made major waves.The community's faves often reflect the tastes of the public at large, but spotlighted below are a few artists on this list that only could've started on TikTok.SPOTLIGHT:Tai Verdes released his single \"Stuck In The Middle\" while he was still an employee at a local Verizon store, but TikTok has enabled him to become one of music's most exciting young stars. He delivered on the promise that convinced us to name him an Emerging Artists of 2020, scoring his first-ever Billboard Hot 100 hit with the TikTok-trending \"A-O-K.\"Using a stage name derived from her TikTok handle, the mysterious PinkPantheress first gained notice on TikTok with her singular mix of futuristic nostalgia, which seemed to emanate from the ether as it transfixed TikTok users on both sides of the Atlantic. Infectious, bite-sized, DnB-sampling songs like \"Passion,\" \"Pain,\" and \"Just For Me\" rose from their origins as TikTok sounds to become massive singles with hundreds of millions of combined streams on Spotify.Yes, you read it correctly: one of TikTok's most popular artists of 2021 was The Backyardigans, a fictional trio from a long-gone Nickelodeon kids' cartoon. For several weeks in Summer 2021, you couldn't scroll through TikTok without seeing someone's creative interpretation of \"Castaways\" or \"Into The Thick Of It,\" each of which made ideal source material for comedic sketches. Though the songs were originally written with children in mind, TikTok creators of all ages can appreciate the surprisingly complex songcraft behind these inescapable numbers.Evergreen Sounds: Top Classic TracksOne of the most interesting things about TikTok is how the creativity of its community creates new context for a piece of music. On TikTok, vintage hits stand shoulder to shoulder with songs by rising acts and current superstars–plenty of songs from past eras of music have found new life on the platform, and some even returned to the charts. Among the most notable examples was \"Rasputin,\" a 1978 disco hit by German pop act Boney M, which cracked TikTok's list of Top 20 Global Songs in 2021, and with some help from a remix by UK producer Majestic, returned to the Top 20 of the UK Singles Charts and the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart. The rest of the list is peppered with evergreen classics, from the hard-hitting pitter-patter of Run-DMC, to the flute-laden disco of Van McCoy, to the soulful sounds of Bill Withers and Grover Washington.SPOTLIGHT: Bee Gees - \"More Than A Woman\" - A sweeping disco epic that highlighted one of the most romantic scenes in Saturday Night Fever before becoming a massive hit for Tavares, \"More Than A Woman\" resurfaced on TikTok as the ideal soundtrack for moments that boost serotonin. The song's TikTok success inspired British artist and producer SG Lewis to create a new remix, titled \"More Than A Woman - SG's Paradise Edit,\" which boosted the bass and shined a spotlight on the song's groovy percussion. Buoyed by a two-person dance trend, \"More Than A Woman - SG Paradise Edit\" helped the Bee Gees make TikTok feel like it was 1977 all over again.Take a look at the songs released more than 25 years ago that made the biggest impact on TikTok this year:Call It A Comeback! Top \"Comeback\" TracksOldies bring nostalgia and new music brings thrills, but what role do songs that don't quite fit either category play? This year, TikTok gave those wayward songs a home, as a host of non-current, not-yet-classic songs reached trending status and gained second life as a result. These songs provided the soundtrack for some of the most memorable trends of the year, from the text-on-screen \"now look at this\" fact reveals of Kid Cudi's \"Day N Nite,\" to the inspired choreography set to Britney Spears' \"Gimme More,\" to the role model salute of Lukas Graham's \"Mama Said.\"SPOTLIGHT: Dr. Dog - \"Where'd All The Time Go?\" - Originally released in 2010, Dr. Dog's \"Where'd All The Time Go?\" is a wistful and transporting indie rock ballad that deals head on with the inevitable fact of aging. The song's swirling intro became one of the most familiar sounds on TikTok in 2021–a distant, mechanized voice intones \"above the cloud were cliffs,\" as sonorous synths whisper in circular arpeggios. TikTok creators seized upon the song's wistful vibe, using TikTok's reverse shapeshifting creative effect to seamlessly illustrate how time passes, but some relationships last forever. Many creators used the song to comment on their recent graduations from college or high school, to pay tribute to lost loved ones, or to soundtrack \"selfie-a-day\" art projects.\"Comeback\" tracks are classified as trending songs released between 5 and 25 years ago.Welcome To The Internet: Music Moments of the YearSHIVER ME TIKTOKS! #SeaShanty blows the app down:There once was a trend that blew up on TT/And the name of the trend was #SeaShanty. That’s right mateys, Sea Shanties had a major moment on TikTok in early 2021, making waves with users eager to show off their voices as well as those just looking to vibe. The salty sea dog most responsible for the surprising shanty surge is Scottish singer Nathan Evans, who won the community’s hearts and minds with rousing acapella-and-hand-percussion renditions of shanties like “The Scotsman” and “The Wellerman.” The latter became a TIkTok hit, with users of all vocal ranges using TikTok’s duet function to add their own harmonies. The #SeaShanty community is a niche, but a sizable and growing one–the hashtag has over 6.3 billion video views, and “The Wellerman” climbed into the Top 20 of the Spotify U.S. Viral 50 chart.Vano 3000 encourages users to make their own #adultswim bumpersNew York rapper/producer Vano 3000 (@supvano) stumbled onto an unlikely trend when he shared \"Running Away,\" a remix of \"Time Moves Slowly,\" a 2016 collaboration between Jazz trio BADBADNOTGOOD and Future Islands lead singer Samuel T. Herring. Vano’s remix pitches up the original, soups up the drums, and sets the kind of cloudy and atmospheric vibe that users on TikTok immediately likened to the sounds that would accompany the classic bumper ads that air during Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block. Since Vano posted a video of himself chowing down on fast food while vibing to the song, the sound has racked up over 195k video creations, most of which saw creators using text on screen to couch their favorite bits of offbeat wisdom using the classic AS bumper format. The hoopla around the trend inspired BADBADNOTGOOD to join TikTok with a video of the band playing Vano's sped-up arrangement of their song, and an official version of the song credited to Vano, BBNG, and Herring came out in June. Even Adult Swim itself hopped on the trend via their own TikTok account. Vano has loudly voiced his appreciation for the fans who helped #vano3000 (678 million views) and #adultswim (1.1 billion views) into trends.Please welcome Rock & Pop royaltyTikTok is an engine of music discovery, capable of helping a new artist reach the biggest audience possible, but it's also a great platform for celebrating the legacy of some of music's biggest legends. In 2021, some of the most iconic acts in rock and pop history joined the platform, bringing songs from their legendary catalogs with them. In October, TikTok came together to welcome The Beatles, who officially joined the platform in conjunction with the release of Let It Be (Super Deluxe), inspiring a dramatic re-arrangement of \"Eleanor Rigby\" by TikTok creator Cody Fry that eventually earned a GRAMMY nomination. TikTok's epic #RockTober celebration continued with the arrival of Led Zeppelin (celebrating the 50th anniversary of Led Zeppelin IV) and U2, who arrived along with their new song \"Your Song Saved My Life.\" Also notable was the arrival of ABBA, the giants of Swedish pop, who landed on the app ahead of Voyage, their first new album in 40 years, and have become staples on For You Pages with piano versions of their hits, celebrations of their career accomplishments, encouragement of the #chiquitachallenge, and Ian McKellen-assisted holiday greetings.TikTok (Taylor's Version)With over 4.6 billion video views , the #swifttok hashtag is one of the internet's premier destinations for Taylor Swift-related discourse. Using the tag, Swift fans on TikTok post performance and interview clips of the artist, create their own Taylor-inspired montages and videos, and for much of 2021, they used the tag to implore their fave to join the platform. This past August, Taylor answered her fans' prayers, joining the platform to help fans get excited for Red (Taylor's Version). As Fall dawned and the album approached, fans on TikTok grew more and more excited about the impending release–Taylor fanned the flames with a special Red-themed TIkTok filter and tantalizing glimpses of the 10-minute \"Taylor's Version\" of \"All Too Well.\" When the extended \"All Too Well\" dropped, it caused a TikTok tizzy, with over 81k video creations in the first week, helping the song become the longest single to ever top the Billboard Hot 100. Taylor was the first to thank her fans on TikTok for helping her reach her latest milestone, posting a video using an adorable trending sound to express her gratitude and disbelief.TikTok to the charts: Popular accounts make their pop debutsJust as emerging artists use TikTok to find new fans, influential TikTok users take advantage of their platform to achieve their dream of becoming pop stars. Creators like Dixie, Lil Huddy, and Nessa Barrett (who reached the Hot 100 with her single \"i hope ur miserable until ur dead\") earned major label contracts and millions of monthly listeners on Spotify by leveraging their loyal followings on the platform. The most impactful of these creators-turned-artist was likely Bella Poarch, whose single \"Build A B*tch\" generated over 4.3 million combined video creations. Both \"Build A B*tch\" and \"INFERNO,\" Bella's collaboration with fellow TikTok creator Sub Urban, made TikTok's list of Top 20 most-viewed pop songs of 2021.Songwriting Starts On TikTokEmerging artists and songwriters use TikTok to bare their soul and to strut their stuff. They have faith in the community's ability to spot talent, and the app's infrastructure that allows an baby artist to make major waves. Here were some of our favorite examples of artists using TikTok to get their original music to the masses:Canadian singer-songwriter JESSIA had an idea for a chorus for her latest song, so she recorded it in her car and posted on TikTok, racking up over 1 million views in just one day. Two days later, producer Elijah Woods caught wind of the song and produced Jessia's acapella hook into a pop bop. The song, called \"I'm Not Pretty,\" became a body positivity anthem, generating over 60k video creations and 9 million Spotify streams in its first month of release. JESSIA eventually charted on Billboard's Emerging Artists and Digital Song Sales charts. Now signed to Republic Records, JESSIA followed up her TikTok success by releasing a remix to \"I'm Not Pretty\" with an appearance from Bebe Rexha.Aspiring artist Reyanna Maria built an audience on TikTok by engaging with other users on the platform, making her own beats and covering songs by Ariana Grande, Summer Walker, SZA, and Billie Eilish. Reyanna had a major breakthrough when she used TIkTok's duet feature to rhyme atop a beat by @katoproducer with a calm and confident verse, earning over 2 million views in the process. After clamoring from followers and fans, Reyanna made the audio into a TikTok sound (1.6 million video creations), and eventually a full song called “So Pretty.” Reyanna Maria’s success with “So Pretty” led to a record deal with Republic Records and a verse from Tyga for the official remix.Jax is one of TikTok’s most creative rising musicians, using her platform to post parody songs that provide an unseen perspective on classics. It turns out, when you look at “Jessie’s Girl” from Jessie’s perspective, Rick Springfield’s narrator seems less romantic and more sketchy! In some of her other videos, she chastises Olivia Rodrigo for her irresponsible driving, gives a terrible Yelp review for the “Hotel California,” and proves that the relationship detailed in Avril Lavigne’s “Sk8ter Boi” wasn’t built to last. In recent weeks, Jax has been showing off some of her original songs, including “Ring Pop,” which have the same verve and sense of humor as her parodies, and in February, she celebrated signing a record deal with Atlantic by writing an original song that details her origin story.Hyperpop sugar crashes onto TikTokMusic fans on TikTok have an advanced sonic palette, and the blown-out synths, distorted percussion, and manipulated vocals of hyperpop seems directly aimed towards their pleasure centers. Hyperpop artists reverberate across For You pages of all kinds: the snotty rhymes of 100 Gecs to the percolating, dark trap music of WHOKILLEDXIX, to the mutating chiptune of Kero Kero Bonito, to the sonic assault of genre progenitor A.G. Cook. TikTok's undeniable hyperpop hit of the year was ElyOtto's \"SugarCrash\" (6.8 million video creations), a chaotic confection that combined the day-to-day stresses of teenage life with a mutated melody built to stick in your head for ages at a time.Baby Are You Coming For the Ride? - WILLOW meets us at our spotWILLOW has been a recording artist for over a decade, but in 2021, it seemed as if she grew up before our eyes. After scoring a TikTok (and Billboard) hit with the Travis Barker-produced \"transparent soul,\" WILLOW teamed up with Tyler Cole and The Anxiety to craft one of the year's most inescapable earworms: \"Meet Me At Our Spot.\" The song's wistful vibe and powerful vocal performance spawned multiple trends–one in which creators reminisced about summers past, another in which uses a TikTok filter that transforms users into cartoon characters. The most interesting about the \"Meet Me At Our Spot\" phenomnenon–the trending sound didn't come from a polished studio recording, but from a live performance that emphasized WILLOW's passionate vocals and inspired musicians on TikTok to play along.TikTok Theater - Musical moments from stage to For You page (and vice versa!)It was a big year for musical theater on TikTok. Never one of the better known songs from Annie, the version of \"Opportunity\" sung by Quvenzhané Wallis for the 2014 film version caught fire on the platform (402k creations) as users seized upon opportunities that ranged from life-changing to routine. The long-awaited film release of Lin-Manuel Miranda's In The Heights caused a TikTok stir, as the jaunty number \"No Me Diga\" inspired over 200k creations filled with juicy gossip. The most significant musical development of the year was an original TikTok creation, as the songwriting duo of Abigail Barlow & Emily Bear combined to create an original musical based on the Netflix show Bridgerton, writing a full album of original songs and posting the results on their TikTok accounts. To put a cap on this unlikely journey, the Unofficial Bridgerton Musical is heading to a London stage in 2022 for its first-ever live production.Can I interest you in Bo Burnham all of the time?Musical comedy sensation Bo Burnham is a digital native, building an audience on the internet with his hilarious songs and short-form jokes before becoming an acclaimed comic and film director. It should be no surprise, then, that he has a huge following on TikTok, where his fans eagerly post videos soundtracked to songs from his 2021 Netflix special Inside. A satirical ode to the Amazon CEO, Burnham’s song “Bezos!” (1.1 million combined video creations) is the ideal soundtrack to moments where you maximize your earning potential. His song “All Eyes On Me” (158k video creations) caused TikTok users to ponder their place in the cosmos, and bemoan their overeager immune systems. Nearly every song included in Inside generated over thousands of video creations, as his fans on TikTok reflected on the deep questions Burnham asked about living life online.Oh I'm Curious! Top Artist Original SoundsTikTok's emphasis on sound allows artists to communicate and interact with fans in increasingly creative ways. They use the app to create remixes or mashups, or create a universe of memes. Our list of the \"Top Artist Original Sounds\" features multiple entries from Saucy Santana, who seemed to start a trend with nearly every video he created, and @sickickmusic, the masked mashup maven. Notable videos in this list include @tiktokbrownchick's piano ballad version of \"WAP,\" @JVKE's mash up of Trinidad Cardona's \"Dinero\" and Internet Money's \"His N Hers,\" and Taylor Swift's encouragement of her fans to use \"her version\" of her trending song \"Wildest Dreams.\"Artists also used original sounds to share tantalizing snippets of new music. Donned in a tuxedo with a similarly-dressed accompanier on the piano, Coi Leray used TikTok to preview her song \"TWINNEM,\" which became one of the most popular songs on TikTok in 2021. Before the official audio generated over 4 million creations, Cfinaloi's original sound generated over a million views on its own. Using the snippet, Coi was able to create organic excitement around her new song, and create a sense of ownership for fans on TikTok who feel like she wrote it just for them.@coileray @saucysantana @jvke @jhacari @kyleyoumadethat @nicoletv @taylorswift @sickickmusic @sickickmusic @saucysantana NEED YOU TO STAY: Global Top TracksTikTok's list of top songs for 2021 features a mix of megahits from unlikely sources strewn across the globe. Streaking across For You pages powered by irresistible dance challenges and memes, U.S. hip-hop takes up much of the global list, but the community's diverse tastes propelled pop songs from Australia, hyperpop from Canada, and ragged rock from Italy into the stratosphere. Here are the year's most popular songs, along with their stories:Masked Wolf - \"Astronaut In The Ocean\" - Originally released in 2019 by a then-unknown rapper from Sydney, Australia, \"Astronaut In The Ocean\" became one of the year's biggest sleeper successes, its existential angst soundtracking millions of TikTok videos and racking up billions of views en route to a Top 10 Billboard placement.Måneskin - \"Beggin\" - Capturing the hearts of a continent after winning Eurovision, Italian rock band Måneskin earned a surprise TikTok smash with their cover of Frankie Valli's 1967 hit.Popp Hunna - \"Adderall (Corvette Corvette) - A dance challenge propelled Popp Hunna's fast-paced heater to trending status for months on end, as the song launched from the streets of Philadelphia to far corners of the globe.ElyOtto - \"SugarCrash!\" - Expressing conflicting emotions with saccharine synths and abrasive auto-tune, \"SugarCrash!\" turned Canadian 17-year-old ElyOtto into a household name–his song reflects the TikTok community's deep love for hyperpop.The Kid Laroi & Justin Bieber - \"STAY\" - The Kid Laroi was highlighted by TikTok as an Emerging Artist after his success on the platform in 2020 and he more than made good on his promise in 2021. Laroi revealed \"STAY\" (partially penned by TikTok-beloved Charlie Puth) as a snippet on TikTok months before its official release–building enough momentum to earn a featured spot from Bieber and eventually topping the Billboard Hot 100 for seven non-consecutive weeks (and 11 weeks topping the charts in his homeland of Australia).Oliver Tree - \"Life Goes On\" - One of the year's fastest-growing and most effortlessly shareable stars on TikTok scored a hit with this vibey and infectious pop jam.Erica Banks - \"Buss It\" - TikTok loves Texas rap–Erica Banks put Dallas on the map with her sultry, Nelly-sampling slapper.YungManny - \"Clap For Em\" ft. Flo Milli & Sada Baby - Two breakout TikTok heroes from 2020 helped a buzzing Maryland teenager raise his profile when they hopped on \"Clap For Em.\"Megan Thee Stallion - \"Cognac Queen\" - Once again the queen of all she surveys, it was clear that Thee Stallion wouldn't be denied a spot on this list.Cardi B - \"Up\" - Megan's \"WAP\" duet partner struck TikTok gold with her only solo single of 2021–don't be surprised if she places a song even higher on 2022's list.And here are the rest of TikTok's Global Top 20 for 2021:Up & Stuck: Top Tracks (US)The list of top songs in the United States is dominated by hip-hop of all shapes and sizes–songs that sparked some of the year's biggest dances and funniest trends. Beyond the beats and rhymes lie songs by some of TikTok's biggest breakout stars–Olivia Rodrigo brought anthemic heartbreak, Tai Verdes offered laidback vibes, and PinkPantheress transfixed with her wistful vocals and reinterpretations of UK garage.Spotlight: Olivia Rodrigo The early weeks of 2021 hit pop music like an earthquake thanks to the arrival of Olivia Rodrigo. Rodrigo posted a video in late 2020 of herself playing her new song \"driver's license\" on the guitar, and just two weeks later, her song was a Billboard #1 smash, with a record-setting Spotify debut to boot. Olivia's incredible first impression was mere prelude of hits to come–she proved her immense songwriting talent with her follow-up single \"deja u,\" and earned her second number one single with the pop-punk breakup anthem \"good 4 u.\" Beyond the big three singles, nearly every song from her chart-topping debut album trended on TikTok, from the vicious opener \"brutal\" to the sweeping ballad \"happier\" to the acoustic \"favorite crime.\"A bit of everything: Top GenresMusic on TikTok is as diverse as its community of users, who bring their own tastes and talents to the table. In general, the distribution of genres on TikTok reflects the tastes of the public at large–rap and pop lead the way, followed by passionate subcultures who can't get enough EDM, R&B, or indie. The biggest growth genre of the year was Latin music, which hopped from 10th on the list in 2020 to 6th this year.Go Best Friend! Top Hip-Hop TracksThe top hip-hop songs on TikTok are a testament to the strength of the genre and the wide-ranging tastes of the TikTok community. Every type of rap music is represented here, from turnt-up Texas trap (Megan Thee Stallion, Erica Banks, TisaKorean), to superstar showcases (Drake, Playboi Carti, Cardi B), to drawling bangers from the deep south (Kevin Gates, LPB Poody), to tongue-twisting sounds of the underground ($ILKMONEY). Though there are plenty of hits from big names, the U.S. hip-hop list is a showcase for emerging stars from all over the rap map, like the ubiquitous Coi Leray, UK drill dons Tion Wayne & Russ Williams, and Philly's own Popp Hunna.SPOTLIGHT: Tion Wayne & Russ Williams - Drill music grew into one of TikTok's favorite subgenres in 2021, as drill songs from Brooklyn, Chicago, and the United Kingdom tore up TikTok's trending charts and creators just danced to drill remixes of songs from other genres. Tion Wayne and his super-sized remix for \"Body\" was one of the biggest drill hits of the year, parlaying a TikTOk trend based on guest artist ArrDee's animated verse to a reign at the #1 spot on the UK Official Charts.Tok to the Future: Top Pop TracksPop fans on TikTok are passionate about their faves, breathlessly anticipating their next moves. The most successful pop stars on TikTok embrace their fans' love, feeding them tidbits of new music along with generous heapings of personality. The pop stars who made the U.S.'s top Pop songs of 2021 all stay active on the platform while crafting songs that stick in listeners minds. The mutual embrace between pop stars and pop stans creates a sense of community and collective goodwill: they celebrate the success of stars like Lil Nas X or Olivia Rodrigo or Bella Poarch–stars that made their name on the platform–as if it were their own.Magic Bombs and Immaculate Vibes: Top Dance/Electronic TracksTikTok loves electronic music of all moods, from high-energy bangers to vibey scene-setters. It was one of the latter that was #1 in the community's heart in 2021–DJ Snake's transformation of a Gap Band classic into a swelling, bass-heavy track equally suited for the club or nights spent at home. The dance/electronic songs that TikTok vibed with most heavily reflect the genre's global nature–find songs from Italy (Kina), Canada (Kaytranada), Sweden (Ikson), the UK (Navos, who earned a contract with Island Records), and perhaps most notably, Vietnam, the home of Hoàng Read, whose \"The Magic Bomb\" soundtracked one of the year's most enduring trends.Notable among this list is Kaytranada's \"Caution,\" which premiered on TikTok as we honored Black music during Black History Month.TwangTok: Top Country TracksFancy like Applebee's and always ready to have a little fun, Country fans and the music they love are a major part of what makes TikTok tick. The community helped propel Walker Hayes' \"Fancy Like\" to the top reaches of the Billboard Hot 100 and a Best Country Song GRAMMY nomination, making it the biggest Country crossover hit of the year. Other songs on the list have major TikTok stories–Luke Combs debuted a snippet of \"Forever After All\" in 2020 that helped the song make a #2 debut on the Hot 100, and the legendary Shania Twain announced her arrival on TikTok with an empowering video set to her own \"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\" Ranging from classics by NGDB, to songs from emerging artists like RaeLynn, to hits by superstars like Gabby Barrett and Dan + Shay, 2021 made clear that country music starts on TikTok.Left Of The Dial: Top Alternative/Rock TracksRock music holds a special place in the hearts of the TikTok community, and the genre had a major year in 2021. We welcomed legendary acts like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and The Rolling Stones to TikTok, and stars like John Mayer fill For You pages with creative ideas and duet invitations. But the songs on TikTok's list of Top Alternative/Rock Tracks of 2021 come from unlikelier sources. The TikTok community helped make Måneskin one of the biggest bands in the world (in addition to the megahit \"Beggin,\" songs like \"MAMMAMIA\" and \"I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE\" trended on the platform), wholly embraced WILLOW's new pop-punk-flavored creative direction, and transformed their appearances to the tune Kim Dracula's cover of Lady Gaga's \"Paparazzi.\" Indie rock made major inroads, this year, as the community vibed to Beach Bunny's sugar-coated emo bliss, the shambolic, bite-sized lo-fi banger of Lonely God's \"Marlboro Nights,\" and Mitski's disco-flavored \"Nobody,\" which helped some TikTok creators indulge the urge to run away from negativity.De noche y de día: Top Latin TracksLatin music was the fastest-growing genre on TikTok in 2021, expanding far beyond the Spanish language sphere and becoming a global behemoth. Though the latest reggaeton hits are well represented by the likes of Bad Bunny, Jhay Cortez, and Jowell & Randy, TikTok's list of top Latin tracks in the U.S. in 2021 demonstrates the wide variety of Latin music that trends on the platform, from Colombian Alt-Pop (Monsieur Perine) to EDM crossover (Farruko) to Dominican dembow (El Alfa). Kali Uchis's dreamy, bilingual pop smash \"telepatía\" became one of the year's crossover hits after trending on TikTok. Ivan Cornejo's \"Está Dañada\" became one of the first regional Mexican hits to ever chart on the Billboard Hot 100. A notable entry into the top 5: Gipsy Kings' rollicking \"Bamboleo,\" which first garnered attention upon its release in 1988 before becoming one of TikTok's biggest Latin hits this year.Track Stars & Love Songs: Top R&B TracksTikTok has a devoted community of R&B lovers on the platform, who appreciate the genre in all its forms. The top two tracks encompass two flavors of rap-influences, with Mooski's soaring street melodics and Luke Nasty's smooth flow on his 2015 hit \"Might Be.\" Along with Mooski, TIkTok's biggest R&B songs of 2021 announced the arrival of new stars, like Giveon, whose tear-inducing, deep, and velvety vocals elevated hits like Justin Bieber's \"Peaches\" and his own \"Heartbreak Anniversary,\" Kaash Paige, who set the vibe when an intimate 2019 bonus track resurfaced as a TikTok hit, and RealestK, who makes sonorous hymns for late nights. Classic styles are also represented here, including Silk Sonic's immaculate retromania and Ciara's string-laden, oh-so '00s \"Like A Boy\" (2006).A Deeper Dive: ArtistsA Salute to Jason Derulo, who makes TikTok His OwnJason Derulo was one of the first artists to grasp what makes TikTok special, and he remains the most-followed artist in the U.S.–he has his finger on the pulse of the community, collaborating with creators, and frequently engages with trends in his trademark over-the-top, high-production value style.No Choice But To Stan: Artist Accounts With The Most GrowthTikTok is a place where emerging artists rub shoulders with superstars. The list of artists with the most new followers include artists that emerged this year like Olivia Rodrigo, and artists who recently joined the platform like Billie Eilish, but this year also saw major growth from artists that fans associate with TikTok, like Lil Nas X, Lizzo, and Jason Derulo.SPOTLIGHT: After starting a TikTok in late 2020, Billie Eilish fully embraced it this year in the run up to her second album Happier Than Ever. She dramatically revealed her new blonde hairstyle in April, and became much more active, posting videos of her dog, giving behind the scenes looks at her \"Lost Cause\" music video, and clapped back at her haters. Billie was the U.S. artist who gained the most followers in 2021, with over 30 million new followers gained in the calendar year.Industry Babies: Most Viewed ArtistsArtists succeed on TikTok if they can achieve a balance between showmanship and relatability, and the ten artists with the most views on their account videos have managed to strike that balance with creative aplomb.SPOTLIGHT: Lil Nas X In 2019, Lil Nas X released the biggest hit in TikTok (and Billboard) history, and 2021 still might have been his biggest year yet. He spent much of the year teasing his \"baby,\" his debut album MONTERO, encouraging fans' creations for hits like \"Industry Baby\" and \"That's What I Want,\" honing his peerless wit, and overall just having a good time. Fans on TikTok can tell that Lil Nas is having a blast, and his creativity encourages them to check out his page for new updates, rather than passively wait for him to appear on a For You page. Top Videos by Artists (Most Views)From surprising plane encounters to adorable pet reveals, artists on TikTok made an impact with much more than just music in 2021. Ranging from funny to energetic to just plain weird, these videos generated hundreds of millions of views brought joy to fans and onlookers alike.SPOTLIGHT: Latin music is a large and growing genre on TikTok in the U.S., and it made a huge impact in 2021. The list of most viewed videos by artists includes a clip of J Balvin partaking in a trend inspired by his own Skrillex-produced hit \"IN DA GETTO,\" Colombian superstar Karol G dancing by herself in a hotel room with audio by @chikybombomreal, and perhaps most surprisingly, a clip of the eternally youthful reggaeton legend Daddy Yankee getting a fresh haircut and vibing to his latest single.lilnasx daddyyankee billieeilish olivertree jbalvin sabrinacarpenter jaxwritessongs olivertree billieeilish karolg Power of Two: Most DUETTED ArtistsTikTok's Duet feature allows creators to respond to one another and build upon each other's creativity, with results that range from unexpected to funny to artful. Artists and musicians on TIkTok are the perfect subject for the Duet feature, offering fans the opportunity to play along with their song, harmonize with their vocals, or just react to their antics. John Mayer channels his inner music teacher, laying down a six-string groove for fans to jam over or working through the music theory behind his hits, so fans can cover them more easily. Country superstar Tim McGraw used TikTok to encourage creators to harmonize on covers of some of his favorite songs. Platinum-selling producer Kato (@katoproducer) specializes in creating instrumental beats for aspiring rappers to spit over–one of his beats eventually became Reyanna Maria's breakthrough hit \"So Pretty.\" Unofficial Bridgerton Musical co-creator Abigail Barlow taps into TheaterTok, recording instrumentals with lyrics as text on screen so aspiring Broadway performers can show off their vocals, while pianist @ellenonceagain offers a similar service for aspiring pop divas.Baila Baila Baila: TikTok's Top Latin ArtistsLatin music was one of the biggest growth genres on TikTok in the United States, partially powered by a coterie of stars who have fully embraced the platform–they're not just here to promote new music, but to be a part of the app's culture. Colombian superstars J Balvin and Karol G engage with English- and Spanish-language trends, Inglewood's Becky G duets with fans and gives beauty tips, and pop singer Camilo charms TikTok users across the globe with his superlative guitar skills and perfectly-coiffed mustache.LIVE From TikTok, It's 2021TikTok remained one of the internet's top destinations for LIVE-streamed music in 2021, delivering unforgettable performances directly to your phone. Ranging from filmed concerts, to elaborate set pieces, to mold-breaking interviews, TikTok LIVE had fans buzzing all year long. Here were some of the most memorable LIVE moments of 2021:Ed Sheeran set records with his July 2021 performance, which occurred as part of TikTok's partnership with the UEFA Euro 2020 football tournament. The show drew over 5.5 million unique viewers–a TikTok record. Did it also help inspire the England team to reach the tournament final? Who's to say?Coming through with a Valentine's Day treat for TikTok, Justin Bieber hosted a special LIVE performance, playing songs from his fan favorite album Journals for the first time in concert.Global reggaeton superstar J Balvin released his most expansive and ambitious album to date in 2021, celebrating the album's drop with an eye-popping LIVE performance on TikTok.This year, TikTok debuted Headstream, a unique interview series that allowed fans to go inside the minds of their favorite artists as they take questions from their toughest interviewer: themselves.

This year, we baked feta pasta, we cheered for Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics, we danced to Berries & Cream, we had bones days, and we had a few no bones days as well. Throughout these moments, we watched brands come together with our community of over 1 billion to entertain and inspire each other and, together, create culture.Our community of creators, artists, and brands are empowered to bring their authentic selves to TikTok. In fact, our recent Culture Driver study with Flamingo found that 56% of users and 67% of creators feel closer to brands they see on TikTok - particularly when they publish human, unpolished content. True to our motto of \"Don't Make Ads, Make TikToks\", our community has taught the industry that when advertising and marketing is loved like entertainment, brands will see incredible results both on and off the platform. Together we're reminiscing on brands' stand out - and sold out - moments as they continue to lean into TikTok to drive both business and cultural impact. While this list could have been much longer, these US brand moments were just a few of the many that touched the community's hearts (and shopping lists) in 2021.Community Commerce that Sparked a MovementThe impact of #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, the hashtag with 7B+ views and the movement of clearing shelves across the nation, extends far beyond the platform - to bookstores, coffee shops, TV commercials, and everywhere else. When products became beloved by the community overnight, brands continued to show up to amplify these same #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt moments that had the entire community talking and shopping this year. Peter Thomas Roth: In August, Trinidad Sandoval - a previously unheard of creator - decided to showcase her daily routine in a TikTok using Peter Thomas Roth's Instant FIRMx eye cream. Within 24 hours of her video going viral (which now has nearly 34M views!) the eye cream swept off the shelves and sold out online across several major beauty retailers. Peter Thomas Roth estimated that the amount that sold within the first week of this TikTok was equivalent to what would normally sell in six months.Clinique: First introduced in 1971, Clinique's \"Almost Lipstick\" in the shade Black Honey had a major comeback this September on TikTok. Conversations on the shade's universally flattering color surfaced organically, leading customers to flock to stores like Sephora, Ulta, and Clinique where the product flew off the shelves for several weeks. Currently, the hashtag #blackhoney has over 28.2M+ views.Bissell: Despite being on the market since 1997, Bissell's Little Green Machine carpet cleaning device found explosive fame earlier this year thanks to the #CleanTok community. Not only is the product beloved with the hashtag #littlegreenmachine sporting over 69M+ views, but has more than doubled in sales just this year.Products Inspired by the TikTok CommunityWhen the community asks, brands listen. The TikTok community is a never-ending source of inspiration and creativity, and brands are investing more and more resources into adopting an \"always engaged\" TikTok strategy to ensure they never miss a beat. By leaning into viral moments, these brands launched entirely new products based off of the TikTok community's organic conversations surrounding their brands and items. GAP: GAP's brown hoodie went viral organically with #gaphoodie reaching 8.2m+ views and counting thanks to a post by creator Barbara Kristofferson. Although the hoodie was vintage, the TikTok community created such viral demand that GAP brought it back in stock after ending production over a decade ago. More recently, TikTok and GAP partnered for the “Gap Hoodie Color Comeback”, a campaign that decided GAP's next hoodie release by engaging the TikTok community to vote for the next product color - with hot pink being voted as the ultimate winner. The product is now listed online as the \"TikTok Super Pink Neon Logo Hoodie\".eos: In February, TikTok creator Carly Joy went viral for sharing an authentic and honest review of eos’ shave cream. The video went viral, causing eos to see 25x their typical order growth and 450x growth in website visits for the shave cream. At Target, eos became the #1 shave brand across men and women the week of Carly’s TikTok, and held that position for several weeks until it completely sold out at Target. In response, eos launched a limited-edition product called “'Bless Your F#@%ing Cooch” as a nod to Carly's colorful verbiage in her original review.Isle of Paradise: Having first gone viral in March 2020, Isle of Paradise Self-Tanning Water went viral for a second time in February 2021 - but this time, creators were pouring the hydrating tanning Waters into continuous mister bottles to create an at-home spray tan experience. Foamy3 was the first to share this game-changing self-tanning hack with the TikTok community. The trend caught on so quickly, it caused the Self-Tanning Water Refills to sell out at Sephora within 24hrs. Immediately picking up on the trend, Isle of Paradise developed their own branded Pro Glow Spray Tan Kit, launching it within 3 months of the first viral video. It’s the brand’s very first crowdsourced product and a successful one at that, with the Kit already a best-seller at Sephora.Campaigns that Inspired Co-Creation within the CommunityOn TikTok, anyone can be part of a brand campaign. With access to TikTok's suite of endlessly fun in-app tools and advertising solutions like Duet and Branded Effects, it's easier than ever for brands to inspire the community to co-create alongside them. With their interactive co-creation campaigns, these brands had us hungry, well-dressed, and imaginative this year. JIF: For their biggest campaign on TikTok to date, JIF launched an In-Feed advertising campaign and Hashtag Challenge in collaboration with Ludacris called the #JifRapChallenge. The partnership inspired our community to “Duet” Ludacris’ rap challenge with a spoonful of peanut butter in their mouth, making for some creative (and tasty) custom music.Ralph Lauren: As the official outfitter of Team USA, Ralph Lauren partnered with TikTok to build a custom Branded Effect to celebrate the 2020 Olympics. With over 52.6M views, the hashtag #RLxTeamUSA encouraged the community to show their all American outfits and Olympic spirit.Ford: To reveal the launch of the new Ford P758 Pickup, TikTok and Ford partnered to create a custom, first-of-its-kind augmented reality Branded Effect Truck as part of Ford's TikTok campaign. The #FordMaverick campaign challenged the TikTok community to get creative in imagining where they would put their Ford Maverick. The #FordMaverick hashtag reached 10.7B+ video views and garnered 17k+ video creations in less than a month.Brands Responding to Trending ConversationsTikTok is home to some of the funniest, most heart-warming, and culturally relevant conversations on the internet, and brands have found their voice among the chatter. Here are some examples of brands not only jumping into conversations, but starting ones that brought joy and laughter to the TikTok community. NFL: It all started when Emily Zugay, a 24 year-old with a degree in graphic design, took to TikTok to sarcastically recreate popular brands' logos. After sending a call to action to brands on the platform, over 60+ brands including McDonald's, The Washington Post, and more began to flock to her comment section to ask for a logo design of their own. The NFL was early to get in on the fun, leading Emily to recreate the NFL's logo. The NFL's official account responded to Emily's video with a redesign of their own (which soon became Emily's TikTok profile photo).Walmart vs. Target: After a Target employee Jaden Delham jokingly posted a TikTok about how Target is holding one of Walmart's shopping carts hostage, Walmart swiftly responded with a clip of the quintessential Walmart vest resting on Target's signature red ball with the caption \"return the cart and we’ll return the ball.\" Soon after, Target's official account responded by assembling their partner brands (Starbucks, Ulta Beauty, Disney, and Apple) as a team ready for action. With brands from all over engaging in the comment section, the Walmart versus Target debacle had the community laughing for days. The official @walmart even experienced an increase of 13x daily average account followers after their response video had been posted. For Target, combined with other ad campaigns designed to drive engagement, the viral exchange helped them exceed 1M+ followers that week.Applebee's: When country star Walker Hayes’ song “Fancy Like” gained popularity on TikTok, a lyric mentioning Applebee’s Oreo shake stood out in particular. The community quickly coined choreography behind the song, bolstering Applebee’s long lost menu item all over TikTok. Now, this song - and the shake - are the driving Applebee’s marketing efforts. The brand brought back the shake, and partnered with Walker Hayes to amplify their marketing campaign with his song at the center. Applebee's also recently reported to Delish that their sales rose 102 percent last quarter, part of which could be from the song’s popularity.Mission Driven CampaignsBrands bring so much more than just great products to our platform. By sharing their company ethos, ideals, and purpose, we've seen brands use TikTok as a tool to establish brand affinity through real, authentic connections with consumers. From self-love and beyond, these campaigns redefined what it means to be a purpose-driven marketer and inspired the community by sparking positive conversations on our platform. Dove: The Dove Self-Esteem Project and TikTok partnered to launch a #NoDigitalDistortion campaign aimed at encouraging authenticity and body positivity on social media. The challenge is soundtracked to the song \"I'm Not Pretty\" by Jessia, a self-love song popularized on TikTok earlier this year, and spreads the much-needed message that we're perfect just the way we are – no filters or photo editing needed.”P&G: With over 12B views, Procter & Gamble launched this heartwarming campaign to encourage the TikTok community to share their stories of who inspires them to #LeadWithLove. From Nastia Lukin to David Boudia, this Hashtag Challenge and Branded Effect reminded us to be selfless and compassionate to those around us.Burt's Bees: Burt's Bees' line of Truly Glowing products don't seek to make you look different or \"better,\" but rather amplify who you already are and make you glow from the inside out. This #TrulyGlowingSelfieLove Hashtag Challenge spread the love for natural, conscious beauty products that make us feel great in our own skin. This challenge inspired the community to share what they love about themselves and others, alongside a custom track by Ludovico Einaudi as the ultimate anthem of self empowerment.Brands that Act Like CreatorsFrom tapping into trending sounds and memes to teaching our community new things, brands have taught the industry that creating entertaining content is the key to capturing the TikTok community's attention. By simply taking the time to understand and embrace the creator mindset, we've seen brands grow loyal fanbases and generate unprecedented engagement. Here are the brands whose fresh and endlessly creative content has the community constantly refreshing their For You Feeds. Disney Parks: Disney Parks brings the \"The Happiest Place On Earth\" to TikTok by taking the community on behind-the-scenes tours with cast members, sharing tidbits of Disney’s fascinating history, showcasing the parks’ latest events and exhibitions, and much more.Benny the Bull: By jumping on the latest trends, teaming up with top creators, and even showing up in users' comments sections, the Chicago Bulls mascot has become a beloved staple of the TikTok community. With over 4.7M followers, Benny has amassed a global following by staying true to his character while keeping his pulse on what's happening within the community.Fenty Beauty: Fenty Beauty consistently listens to the community and joins in on organic conversations that are happening about their brand. Using native features including Text-to-Speech and reply to comment with video, the brand has developed an on-platform persona that's playful and real.LIVE Streams the Community Couldn't MissPOV: you're right there with your favorite brand. TikTok LIVE offers a unique opportunity to connect with the community in real-time, and brands have found tremendous success by using this feature to engage their audiences to comment, ask questions, and connect with the people (or animals) behind the brand on a whole other level. Whether they're once in a while or regularly scheduled programming, these are the LIVEs that just couldn't be missed this year.Aquarium of the Pacific: Each week the Aquarium of the Pacific goes LIVE on TikTok to provide an up-close look at their vibrant community of sea animals. From sharing fun facts about Groot the giant Pacific octopus to hanging out in the sea lion habitat, Aquarium of the Pacific curates behind-the-scenes experiences for TikTok that are educational and fun.Netflix: To promote the release of The Kissing Booth 3, star Joel Courtney hosted a LIVE stream on Netflix’s official TikTok account where he watched the trailer for the first time and reacted to messages he received from other cast members. By capturing candid, unscripted moments and reflections from one of the film's stars, Netflix reimagined the typical trailer drop and created a live experience that felt intimate and real.Travel Channel: To celebrate Ghostober this year, the Travel Channel & streaming service discovery+ partnered with ghost detective Ryan Bergara to host a LIVE paranormal investigation at the notoriously eerie Winchester Mystery House. The community was invited to join the house exploration alongside Ryan in real time, posting questions and theories in the comments, creating an engaging LIVE experience.Small Businesses that Inspired the CommunitySmall businesses persevered through unique challenges this year, all the while remaining the souls of our local communities. We're always looking for new ways to help them share their inspiring stories with the TikTok community, and are humbled that our platform helps give them the global visibility (and sales) they deserve. From sharing family recipes to inspiring testaments of what it takes to be a businessowner, here are just some of the many small businesses that touched the community's hearts this year. Izola's Country Cooking: Located in Hinesville, Georgia, Izola's Country Cooking is a Southern comfort food restaurant owned by Glenn and Lori Poole. After seeing their business decline sharply in the face of COVID-19 lockdowns, Lori and Glenn tried out TikTok as a way to reach new customers in their area. The strategy worked. By sharing their authentic story and videos of their mouth-watering food, they've attracted customers near and far and tripled their sales in the process.Sider's Woodcrafting: In 2020, Bruce Graybill, owner of Sider's Woodcrafting, thought he had lost everything. His workshop and products were destroyed in a fire, and COVID-19 lockdowns canceled the craft fairs where he sold his handmade cutting and charcuterie boards. He shared this story with TikTok, and quickly heard from small businesses and customers all over the country who offered to help. With the support of his growing community, Bruce continued to document his work and the shop’s restoration. Today, Bruce has over 150,000 followers, and he says TiKTok saved his business and is directly responsible for 90% of his sales. He also said that this year alone, TikTok drove more than $30,000 in sales for his business.Candy Me Up: Born and raised in the candy industry by her father, Nema Causey, owner of Candy Me Up in La Mesa, California, was close to shutting down her newly-opened business during the pandemic. She turned to TikTok to modernize her marketing strategy and kickstarted her content by piggybacking onto the “Jelly Fruit challenge,” a viral trend with over 3M views that requires one key ingredient: candy. By posting consistent, on-trend, fun TikToks of the candy shop and her life as a business owner, Nema has raked in nearly 1M followers of candy fanatics. This has helped her to pivot to e-commerce, a promising growth area for her due to the 1,000 orders a day she gets from TikTok."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/celebrating-spider-man-fandom-on-tiktok-us","date":"2021-12-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Celebrating Spider-Man™ Fandom on TikTok","text":"Spider-Man may have No Way Home, but fans have found one with our global communityAs Sony Pictures' Spider-Man: No Way Home swings into theaters on December 17, 2021, the franchise is spinning webs of excitement on TikTok, where over 1 billion people come to be entertained in so many ways.With almost 50 billion views of #spiderman, the Spider-Man fandom is among the most active fan communities on TikTok.

Additionally, our reports are now much more visual, with interactive charts and graphs to better illustrate the data and our actions.Our reports will be published in 26 languages, including Arabic, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Melayu, Bengali, Burmese, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, Russian, Urdu, and Vietnamese.Our goal is to make our Transparency Center a one-stop shop to learn about how TikTok moderates and recommends content, develops products, and safeguards people's information. Today's updates are a continuation of that goal, and we're excited to share more updates along the way."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-next","date":"2021-11-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Rewarding creators for their creativity on TikTok with Creator Next","text":"Creators on TikTok entertain over 1 billion people globally - their content brings us joy, makes us laugh, teaches us something new, and offers us a sense of community.

Creators on What Community Means to ThemWhat does it mean to you to be part of the Indigenous community?@giiwedinindizhinikaaz: Belonging to the Indigenous community to me is by default, resistance against colonization. After all we have been through, we are still here. We are still here, and we are as diverse and beautiful as ever! We are still here, and we are protecting the water and defending the land! We are still here, and we are reconnecting, learning our languages and practicing our culture.@indigenouszane: I feel honored. I feel important and I feel special.@nayhamills2: To me, being a part of the Indigenous community means strength.@reynachabeli: Being Indigenous means that I am able to pass on my native language and traditions to the younger generation. It makes me hopeful that my People will continue to prosper.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?@giiwedinindizhinikaaz: My culture has shaped me by providing me with the tools and courage to stand up for what is right – standing up in a good way, that is led with love, even if it makes me uncomfortable! The earth can’t speak for her rights, the water can’t speak for her rights, and the animals can’t either. So if not them? Then who? Us Indigenous people!@indigenouszane: It’s made me realize that I should love the skin I’m in, appreciate my culture and try to educate others about my culture.@nayhamills2: I believe my culture has shaped me to be the strong woman I am today – by making me proud to show my traditions and beliefs to those who know little to nothing about the native people. It has influenced me to make these makeup videos to educate people on problems going on in the native community and how to help.@reynachabeli: My culture has taught me how to see the beauty in me. It shows me that the darkness in my skin is beautiful and that I carry my ancestors through my Indigenous features.How do you share your culture both on and off of TikTok?@giiwedinindizhinikaaz: I share my culture on TikTok through fun videos either with trending audios, or my own original audios where I talk and teach. As for how I share it off of TikTok, I share and teach (language and plant knowledge) at different water protector gatherings or events.@indigenouszane: On TikTok, I make videos about indigenous history, tribes, cultures and languages. Off of the platform, I share the videos I make with the world, and also make public speeches in my city (Troy, Ohio).@nayhamills2: I make awareness videos about important news going on in the native community. I also like to make funny videos to help natives understand that we all are the same and go through the same struggles in a humorous manner. Off of the platform, I post on Facebook and Instagram to pave a way for those who may not have TikTok.@reynachabeli: On TikTok, I like to make videos about my experience growing up in my Indigenous pueblo in Oaxaca. Off of TikTok, I sell both mezcal and Oaxacan embroidery pieces to help my family back home.How has the TikTok community inspired you?@giiwedinindizhinikaaz: The TikTok community has inspired me to build a platform for myself to educate and advocate for my community. TikTok itself is a community and that’s what I love about the app!@indigenouszane: It’s made me realize that I love doing what I do: making videos and educating people. They have inspired me to keep going and keep on doing what I love to do and make an impact on peoples lives.@nayhamills2: Seeing other natives like myself relating on so many different things has inspired me to share more about my culture and my many difficult experiences. Overall, the TikTok community has inspired me to not be ashamed of my people’s past trauma, but to overcome it by sharing with the TikTok community.@reynachabeli: I have made so many Indigenous friends through TikTok that inspire me to advocate for my community. It has been so inspiring to connect with Natives from other Indigenous groups.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?@giiwedinindizhinikaaz: Don’t get too bit picky about how you look, the little things you notice are not what other folks are interested in. They’re interested in hearing the messages we have to share!@indigenouszane: Be yourself and be original.@nayhamills2: To be yourself and to put yourself out there, don’t worry about what others may think. Everyone will talk, so give them something to talk about.@reynachabeli: Post within a specific niche you are interested in. This makes content creation fun and interesting.Who are some Indigenous TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching?@giiwedinindizhinikaaz: @shinanova and @ugrunna for sure ❤️@indigenouszane: @tiamischik, @indigenous_baddie, @auntcalei, @notoriouscree@nayhamills2: @indigenous_baddie and @tiamischik.@reynachabeli: @magueyerx and @mendoza.arte."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-tv","date":"2021-11-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"TikTok TV is now available in North America","text":"Over a billion people come to TikTok to be entertained, learn something new, create memorable content, and so much more.

Whether starting a new trend or using Duet to collaborate, the creativity of our community shines through. Fostering an environment where creative expression thrives requires that we also prioritize safety for our community, and especially our younger community members. We share the interests of parents and caregivers in this mission, and we're committed to listening and working with external experts to inform our work.A few months ago, we launched a global project to better understand young people's engagement with potentially harmful challenges and hoaxes. While not unique to any one platform, the effects and concerns are felt by all – and we wanted to learn how we might develop even more effective responses as we work to better support teens, parents, and educators. We also hope to contribute to a wider understanding of this area, so today we want to share more on our research and some of the steps we are taking in response.During this project, we:Surveyed more than 10,000 teens, parents, and teachers from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Indonesia, Mexico, UK, US, and Vietnam.Commissioned Praesidio Safeguarding, an independent safeguarding agency, to write a report to capture key findings and recommendations. The report, written by Dr. Zoe Hilton, Director and Founder of Praesidio Safeguarding can be read here.Convened a panel of 12 leading youth safety experts from around the world to review and provide input into Dr. Hilton's report.Partnered with Dr. Richard Graham, a clinical child psychiatrist specializing in healthy adolescent development, and Dr. Gretchen Brion-Meisels, a behavioral scientist specializing in risk prevention in adolescence to guide and advise us.What teens told us about how they assess risksMost challenges are fun and safe: the ice bucket challenge from 2014 helped to promote awareness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), while #BlindingLightsChallenge, dubbed the \"family-bonding craze,\" took off on TikTok and helped bring families closer together. We heard from both Dr. Graham and Dr. Brion-Meisels that adolescence is a period that has always been associated with heightened risk taking. We wanted to understand how this propensity for risk taking motivates teens to participate in challenges to then enable us to work with experts to identify opportunities to better support them in making safe choices.In the study, teens were asked to describe the risk level of a recent online challenge they had seen. Almost half (48 percent) believed they were safe, categorizing them as fun or light-hearted. Thirty-two percent included some risk but were still safe, 14 percent were described as risky and dangerous, while 3 percent of online challenges were described as very dangerous. Just 0.3 percent of teens said they had taken part in a challenge they categorized as very dangerous.The research also found that teenagers use a range of methods to understand the risks that may be involved in online challenges before they participate. This included watching videos of other people taking part in challenges, reading comments, and speaking to friends. Empowering teens by providing them with guidance on how to assess potential risks was identified as one of the most important measures that can help to keep them safe. Close to half (46 percent) of teens stated they want \"good information on risks more widely\" and \"information on what is too far.\"Listening to concerns from parents on the impact of hoaxesSuicide and self-harm hoaxes attempt to make people believe something frightening that isn’t true. Hoaxes like these often have similar characteristics, and in previous cases, false warnings have circulated suggesting that children were being encouraged to take part in \"games\" which resulted in self-harm. Once planted, these hoaxes largely spread through warning messages encouraging others to alert as many people as possible to avoid perceived negative consequences. While the forward sharing of such warnings might seem harmless, the research found that 31 percent of teens exposed to these hoaxes had experienced a negative impact. Of those, 63 percent said the negative impact was on their mental health due to the nature of the content.We also heard how caregivers aren't sure how to talk to teens about these hoaxes. They worry that if they mention the name of the hoax, their teen could become aware of potentially harmful behavior they previously had no knowledge of. More than half (56 percent) of parents said they wouldn't mention a self-harm hoax unless a teen had mentioned it first, and 37 percent of parents felt hoaxes are difficult to talk about without prompting interest in them.Strengthening our protection effortsWe have used the findings from Dr. Hilton's report to inform a review of our policies and processes, and we're making a number of improvements to build on our existing safeguards.The research showed how warnings about self-harm hoaxes - even if shared with the best of intentions - can impact the well-being of teens. While we already remove and take action to limit the spread of hoaxes of this nature, to further protect our community we will start to remove alarmist warnings about them as they could cause harm by treating the self-harm hoax as real. We will continue to allow conversations to take place that seek to dispel panic and promote accurate information.On one hand, it's encouraging to see that just 0.3 percent of teens say they have taken part in challenges that are very dangerous, but it's important that this isn't interpreted as \"job done.\" Having strong policies is an important part of our work to protect our community, and it's essential that these policies are coupled with strong detection and enforcement measures. We created technology that alerts our safety teams to sudden increases in violating content linked to hashtags, and we have now expanded this to also capture potentially dangerous behavior. For example, a hashtag such as #FoodChallenge is commonly used to share food recipes and cooking inspiration, so if we were to notice a spike in content tied to that hashtag that violated our policies, our team would be alerted to look for the causes of this and be better equipped to take steps to guard against potentially harmful trends or behavior.New resources to support community membersOne of the main findings from the report is that teens, parents, and educators need better information about challenges and hoaxes. We have worked with Dr. Graham, Dr. Brion-Meisels, and Anne Collier (Founder and Executive Director of The Net Safety Collaborative) to develop a new resource for our Safety Center dedicated to challenges and hoaxes. This includes advice for caregivers that we hope can address the uncertainty they expressed about discussing this topic with their teens.Finally, we have worked with Dr. Graham and Dr. Brion-Meisels to improve the language used in our warning labels that would appear to people who attempt to search our platform for content related to harmful challenges or hoaxes. A new prompt will encourage community members to visit our Safety Center to learn more, and should people search for hoaxes linked to suicide or self-harm, we will now display additional resources in search.As we started our initial conversations about this project, we talked with online safety experts and we kept hearing how they felt caregivers, teachers, and NGOs weren't sure how to intervene effectively. We hope the work we've undertaken with these world-leading experts can help make a thoughtful contribution to this topic that others can draw insights and opportunities from as well.

We aim to make TikTok a welcoming place for everyone, and cybercriminals have no place on our platform.Cybercrime takes many forms and affects people across countries, cultures, and communities. From social engineering to email phishing or fake websites, cybercriminals continually shift and refine their techniques. For International Fraud Awareness Week, we're supporting the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) as a continuation of our #BeCyberSmart campaign with the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA). We're kicking off the week with industry experts like the Identity Theft Resource Center, \"Original Internet Godfather\" Brett Johnson, Fraudology podcast host Karisse Hendrick, The Knoble's Ian Mitchell, and Frank McKenna (AKA, Frank on Fraud). Our goal is to spotlight ways to identify scams, verify suspicious activity, and report potential bad actors to the appropriate authorities.\"Fraudsters collaborate -- they work together to team up and victimize innocent people,\" said Brett Johnson. \"The only way to combat online fraud is for the good guys to work together, and the most effective way to raise awareness and protect each other is to engage people where they are: on TikTok.\"\"TikTok moves at the speed of culture, and fraudsters move fast too,\" said Frank McKenna. \"There are a million battles to fight on the fraud front every day, which is why it's so important for platforms like TikTok to help elevate conversations around investing in best practices, technologies, and training before fraud hits.\"\"I've been fighting financial crime and fraud for over 20 years, and there's always more to be done to protect the most vulnerable members of our global society,\" said Ian Mitchell, Founder of The Knoble, a non-profit global network of experts with a passion for fighting human crime. \"TikTok can power positive impact by equipping people all over the world with the information, training, and tools necessary to stay safe online.\"Building fraud awareness and educationWe hope creators and brands alike will engage in #FraudAwarenessWeek by taking important steps to #BeCyberSmart. Here are some of our favorite tips:Protect: Always keep connected devices updated with the latest software. Ignoring reminders to make updates can leave a door open for hackers to exploit you. Use a VPN for an added layer of security, and enable two-step verification to protect your accounts.Prevent: Look out for social engineering attempts where fraudsters pose as a customer service representative to gain remote access to your device, account, or profile. With remote access to your device, scammers can install malware that allows hackers to steal your passwords, identity, financial information, drain your bank accounts, and more.Verify: If you get an enticing offer from an unsolicited phone call, text, or pop-up message, go directly to the actual company's website to be sure it's legitimate. If you can’t confirm the authenticity of the person or offer, it’s probably a scam. Also keep an eye out for incorrect spelling or grammar like someone claiming to work for a government agency without an email address ending “.gov”.Monitor: Continuously monitor your accounts for unauthorized activity. Set automatic alerts for emails or texts with transaction details whenever your debit card, credit card, or Cash App is used. Remember that credit cards offer the most consumer protections when things go awry, and regular credit monitoring is always a best practice. You can also visit HaveIBeenPwned.com to see if your email, phone number, or passwords were part of a breach. If so, that information is available to cybercriminals, so act fast to change your passwords across accounts.Slow down: Unique or time sensitive investment opportunities should give you pause. Urgent expenses for things like IT support, business operations, customs and taxes, travel, or medical needs should also raise alarm bells. Be cautious if requestors quickly demand moving communications to encrypted messaging platforms, and do not share personal identification documents, Social Security or bank account numbers, or any other personal identifiers.Stop: If merchants request more data than you're comfortable sharing or something seems amiss, cancel the transaction. Be wary of requests for unusual payment methods like cryptocurrency, prepaid debit or gift cards, or money services businesses to initiate domestic or foreign wires.#LearnOnTikTok LIVETune in tonight at 5pm PT / 8pm ET for a special #LearnOnTikTok LIVE stream hosted by comedian @Alex_Falcone in conversation with tech creator @mryeester for an insider's perspective on how to avoid falling victim to fraud.\"The holiday season is expected to bring a new surge of malicious activity and bad actors online,\" said Lisa Plaggemier, Interim Executive Director at the National Cyber Security Alliance. \"I'm happy to see TikTok raising awareness and educating people on how to spot and steer clear of scams and cybercrime.\"Fighting digital crimes with industry expertsTikTok's digital crimes and converged security operations play an essential role in fighting cybercrime. We work across business operations, risk control, compliance, and other cross-functional teams to monitor for suspicious activity so we can identify, disrupt, and deter illegal activities on our platform. We also collaborate with a vast network around the world, including organizations like the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and Europol, United Nations (UN) agencies, Financial Action Task Force, World Customs Organization, and other private-public partnerships. Our objective is to help bring resources to the forefront by exchanging information and intelligence to make the digital world more secure.\"As technology continues evolving, scams and fraud tactics evolve in parallel,\" said Karisse Hendrick. \"By coming together to share more information with the global community with TikTok, we can help usher in a safer online world.\"Early detection to ensure community protectionIn addition to pioneering new technologies and developing intelligent automation, we believe it's important to invest in continuous training and development for our teams.

Creators on What Community Means to ThemWhat does it mean to you to be part of the Indigenous community?@asheisgod: Being a part of the Indigenous community means unlearning western ways of thinking and knowing. It requires critical thinking and decolonizing to relearn Indigenous practices.@johnbarbachano: To be unified in purpose and healing.@nativephotography: I’m very honored to be a part of this community to show the beauty and the issues that are going on today and bring awareness to them. It has a special place in my heart and I’m blessed to have this opportunity to show my culture and the love I have for it.@roxyrendoes: It means family, home. It’s my roots when I feel alone or separate.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?@asheisgod: My culture has created who I am today in more ways than one.

Through the Native community I have felt the love we share with each other and how important it is to support one another.@johnbarbachano: It reminds me of who I am and who I need to be.@nativephotography: It has really made me humble and think of the little things more often.

We run a Native American street food truck and share our culture and our traditional foods with new people around the area.@roxyrendoes: On TikTok I offer support to my Native and Black family and make occasional videos of support. Off TikTok I do research and look for details about my culture's history with my grandfather (who is a huge history buff haha) and when I can, I try to attend cultural events.How has the TikTok community inspired you?@asheisgod: Through the TikTok community I learned how important it is to stay true to yourself and surround yourself with those who support and understand you.@johnbarbachano: I see a type of community that’s connected in a unique way. We learn each other's tribes and what drives each other.@nativephotography: It has inspired me by helping me see that being yourself is the best way to be unique. That’s what TikTok is all about — being different. Once you accept that, things will go a long way for you.@roxyrendoes: It inspired me to return to my roots. I hid and buried my true self because I believed that I’d never be accepted. I already got bullied so I was feeling lost, but this community has brought me back to my center of peace.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?@asheisgod: Create content that makes you happy. Build new skills — you will get better as you make mistakes and learn what you love.@johnbarbachano: Just be you. Embrace your culture and share it.

TikTok creators frequently share their love for unique or popular topics, inspiring others to pick up a new hobby or dive deeper into one that was already a part of their lives. Through these shared connections, users elevate and highlight products they love and encourage community growth both on and off TikTok. This is on full display in the steady growth and success of #BookTok, a TikTok community that's full of creative individuals that share a common passion for literature.#BookTok is the go-to hashtag for all content pertaining to books, reading, writing and everything in between. With book reviews, writing tips, plot reenactments of popular novels, and more, this corner of TikTok encourages and inspires others to enjoy literature in all of its forms. The #BookTok community has been on TikTok since early 2020, but saw an initial boost in content during March of 2020 with the beginning of stay-at-home orders. Users turned to TikTok for entertainment and discovering #BookTok recommendations, helping reignite a passion for reading that has grown through the app, inspiring over 5M videos and reaching over 21.9B views globally to date. Examining hashtags that appear most frequently #BookTok videos, we are able to learn more about popular content and trends within the BookTok community. Young Adult - #YABooks - fiction and fantasy is a top category of the BookTok community with other top hashtags covering popular all-time favorites like A Court of Thorns and Roses (#ACOTAR), A Court of Mist and Fury (#ACOMAF), Six of Crows (#sixofcrows), Percy Jackson (#percyjackson), Throne of Glass (#throneofglass), and The Cruel Prince (#thecruelprince). Popular fandoms such as Harry Potter and Twilight have always been a popular topic on TikTok, with readers creating content around these popular worlds both on and off #BookTok. Spanish users also participate heavily as seen through the top #Libros and #LibrosRecomendados hashtags.Writers are also a big part of the community as both book authors and online writers participate in the conversation and share their works with likeminded users. #AuthorsOfTikTok appear frequently in BookTok videos accompanied with tips, exercises, and announcements for their upcoming work. When an author becomes popular on #BookTok, it can lead to an astounding jump in book sales or the beginning of a career as a writer.Chloe Gong joined TikTok while working on a book and grew a community of 100k supporters leading up to its release. After publishing her first novel, \"These Violent Delights,\" in November, during her senior year at the University of Pennsylvania. The novel became a New York Time's Bestseller and Chloe continues to create content for a community of aspiring writers, giving advice and creating entertaining content as she continues her career. Another notable example of a novel and author gaining momentum on TikTok is the surge in popularity for They Both Die at the End by Adam Silvera. This novel was published in 2017, but exploded onto bestsellers lists thanks to reaction videos from the #BookTok community. The association between the title and its popularity is so great that most book stores online have appended the name \"TikTok made me buy it!\" to the novel's title.The impact of #BookTok has also reached international success. Earlier this summer, Japanese TikTok creator Kengo (kengo_book), who is a popular #BookTok creator for the region, posted a TikTok video introducing the novel \"Lipstick on the Afterimage,\" a book originally released in 1989 by Yasutaka Tsutsui. The video's comment section became a discussion board and led the 30-year-old novel to become ranked among the top books on many online shopping sites while selling over 100,000 copies in only a few weeks. This process has repeated itself over the last year with Madeline Miller’s The Song of Achilles, We Were Liars by E. Lockhart, and countless other books. This is part of the reason why Barnes & Noble has a #BookTok table near the entrance to each of its stores. Like Barnes & Noble, other book stores have joined the #BookTok community to share life as a bookstore worker, add book recommendations, create bookstore comedy, restocking, membership, new release, and more. These stores use TikTok to show the fun side of book store life and encourage potential readers explore the physical stores in their area.Libraries and librarians have also found a home on TikTok, sharing the day-to-day life of their jobs, unique book facts, and encouraging users to sign up for their programs and services. While typically thought of as quiet places, #LibrariansOfTikTok and #LibraryTikTok offer librarians an opportunity to show off their personal creativity and make some noise for their favorite library characteristics. Check out these hashtags to see what countless local, public libraries have to offer.On the book publishing side, Penguin Random House is very in-tune with #BookTok trends and frequently collaborates with creators, rounding out all aspects of the book industry found on #BookTok. From writing to publishing, selling, reading, and finally recommending, you can find it all here.Books are among the oldest forms of entertainment, and, in line with TikTok's mission to inspire creativity and bring joy, #BookTok has delighted book fans and encouraged others to take a break from watching to enjoy reading. For those new to TikTok, they might be surprised to find such a vibrant literature community, but #BookTok is just one of several communities of likeminded individuals that the app has fostered leading to a widespread cultural impact off platform."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/join-taylor-swift-as-she-turns-tiktok-red","date":"2021-11-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Join Taylor Swift as she turns TikTok ‘Red’","text":"To celebrate the November 12th release of Red (Taylor’s Version), today Taylor Swift is debuting a creative video effect in addition to exclusively teasing a snippet of “All Too Well” (Taylor’s Version).

TikTok videos longer than one minute receive up over 5 billion views globally, with Green Screen and Color effects giving rise to a huge range of new trends and viral content. Creators around the world embraced more creative freedom with longer videos, with videos spanning over 2 minutes on average. Longer videos are most popular in Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan while TikTok users in the US, UK, and Brazil engage with longer videos the most.From sneak peeks into the personal lives of creators and celebrities, to working days in weird and wonderful vocations or more relatable content created by TikTok's so-called \"stay at home sons and daughters\", vlogs or day-in-the-life videos have emerged among the most popular content categories for longer videos globally, allowing creators and users to connect and learn more about each other's worlds.Creating a sense of community through vlogs and longer videosAt TikTok, real feedback and insights drives us as we focus on enriching the user experience for our community. To further understand what drives the popularity of longer videos, particularly vlogs or day-in-the-life videos, we partnered with social psychology expert Dr. Shira Gabriel, an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Buffalo.Dr. Gabriel noted that people are watching day-in-the-life content on platforms such as TikTok to be entertained not only because it mimics life, but it fosters connection and belonging. \"Entertainment is very personal - what one person finds interesting and inspiring may be very different to their friends or family. Yet vlogs seem universally popular. When we watch vlogs featuring celebrities and personalities, we feel connected to them as we're getting a peek into their day-to-day lives. By mimicking real-life interactions, video is a powerful tool to help form bonds and relationships. It makes us feel like we belong.\"Discovering new worlds through day-in-the-life videos on TikTokWe'll continue listening to our community as we continue to enhance longer videos, building an experience that adds value for creators and viewers alike.

Vane is a queer, Venezuelan nonbinary creator who uses their lighthearted humor to entertain their viewers. They love to tell stories to make their fans laugh, and they post relatable content about growing up Latinx. They are all about spreading positivity and encouraging people to always be unapologetically themselves.Be sure to tune in to the El Grand Finale LIVE on October 15 at 5PM PT/ 8PM ET via @TikTok to hear more from Vane, and read below to find out more about their journey on TikTok!What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?Being part of the Latinx community means telling the stories of the people who helped shape me. Its honoring my community, and spreading the good energy that makes Latinx’s stand out. Whether that be through jokes, stories, or flexing what makes our culture so unique.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?I carry my culture everywhere I go. It's a part of every second in my life. It's influenced the way I dress, the music I listen to, the way I speak, the foods I eat, and most importantly it has shaped the way that I treat people. Venezuelans, like other Latinos, make it a point to treat everybody like family, and really emphasize that sense of community with the people around us. My culture taught me to treat everyone with respect, and love, and to really take a second and learn from everyone around me. My culture raised me to think about others, and has helped me become a self-less, caring, and giving person. I love sharing our food, and our music, and using every aspect that makes me Latinx to bring people together.How do you share your culture & community on and off of TikTok?I share my culture by showing off our dances, our music, telling stories about back home and helping my people thrive. I love sharing our accents, our slang, our recipes, and everything else, so more people can learn about our culture.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has inspired me to share the little things. The community helped me realize that there are so many people who have these shared experiences and love hearing about everyone else’s. The community on TikTok is so supportive and admires what creators have to offer, so it’s helped me be more comfortable sharing the things that Im so proud of.What video are you most proud of creating?I think it's too hard to just pick one. I am very proud of a lot of videos that I've posted, because with every video, people tell me that I've somehow touched them. A very important series of videos to me are my \"Gender Education\" videos. Where I speak about being nonbinary, and how I've navigated my journey of self-discovery. I feel super proud knowing that those videos have helped other people come to terms with their identity, and explore themselves unapologetically the way that I wish I had when I was younger. It's especially nice when it's coming from people in my community however, just because I know the struggles of being queer and Latinx, so knowing that maybe I can help someone, or at least make them laugh is enough to make me feel proud of what I post.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?A tip I always give out is to be yourself. It sounds sorta corny, but for the first few months that I started TikTok, I was posting the things I thought other people would enjoy instead of what I wanted to do myself. It's super important to be authentic to yourself, and make sure that you feel comfortable posting what you post. I recommend that you cater to yourself, because there really is a place for EVERYONE on TikTok, you just have to find your people.Who are some Latinx creators that everyone should be following/watching?@manny_delgado!

We're also sharing updates on our work to protect people from abusive behavior. A look at our latest Community Guidelines Enforcement Report As detailed in our report, 81,518,334 videos were removed globally between April - June for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, which is less than 1% of all videos uploaded on TikTok. Of those videos, we identified and removed 93.0% within 24 hours of being posted and 94.1% before a user reported them. 87.5% of removed content had zero views, which is an improvement since our last report (81.8%).We’re continuing to make steady progress in our proactive detection of hateful behavior, bullying, and harassment. For example, 73.3% of harassment and bullying videos were removed before any reports compared to 66.2% in the first quarter this year, while 72.9% of hateful behavior videos were removed before any reports compared to 67.3% from January - March. This progress is attributable to ongoing improvements to our systems that proactively flag hate symbols, words, and other abuse signals for further review by our safety teams.Harassment as a whole, and hate speech in particular, are highly nuanced and contextual issues that can be challenging to detect and moderate correctly every time. For instance, reappropriation of a term is not a violation of our policies, but using that reappropriated term to attack or abuse another person would violate our hateful behavior policy. Bullying can be highly personal and require offline context that isn't always available. To better enforce our policies, we regularly train and guide our team on how to differentiate between, for instance, reappropriation and slurs or satire and bullying. We've also rolled out unconscious bias training for our moderators and hired policy experts in civil rights, equity, and inclusion. As we make continual improvements to our detection mechanisms, we are striving to get these critical issues right for our community. We encourage people to report accounts or content that may be in violation our Community Guidelines.Building anti-abuse efforts into our productIn addition to removing content, we empower people to customize their experience with a range of tools and resources, including effective ways to filter comments on their content, delete or report multiple comments at once, and block accounts in bulk.We've also added prompts that encourage people to consider the impact of their words before posting a potentially unkind or violative comment. The effect of these prompts has already been felt, with nearly 4 in 10 people choosing to withdraw and edit their comment. Though not everyone chooses to change their comments, we're encouraged by the impact of features like this and we continue to develop and try new interventions to prevent potential abuse.Today we're expanding on these features with improved mute settings for comments and questions during livestreams. Livestreaming on TikTok is an exciting way for creators and viewers to connect, and we're building safety into the experience by design. Now, the host or their trusted helper can temporarily mute an unkind viewer for a few seconds or minutes, or for the duration of the LIVE. If an account is muted for any amount of time, that person's entire comment history will also be removed. Hosts on LIVE can already turn off comments or limit potentially harmful comments using a keyword filter. We hope these new controls further empower hosts and audiences alike to have safe and entertaining livestreams.Reaffirming our commitment to combating antisemitismAs participants to the Malmö International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism, today we're proud to reaffirm our commitment to combat antisemitic content on TikTok by continuing to strengthen our policies and enforcement actions. We also want to keep expanding our work with NGOs and civil society groups so they can harness the power of TikTok to share their knowledge with new audiences, and direct our community to educational resources so they can learn about the Holocaust and modern-day antisemitism.For more information on the steps we're taking to protect the safety of our community and integrity of our platform, we encourage you to read our Q2 report."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-leogonzall","date":"2021-10-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @leogonzall","text":"Leo Gonzalez is a content creator based in Los Angeles, California.

In December 2020, she started on TikTok to talk about her passion for trends and since then she's been recognized by Teen Vogue as an expert trend forecaster! Read more below to find out how Agustina has been influenced and inspired by her culture.What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?It means being part of a large, diverse family that shares similar values while celebrating our cultural differences. All of us come from different places, with different foods, music, accents and customs. But there's something at our core that unifies us -- its in our values, our passions, and our experience as immigrants or children of immigrants in the U.S. One of the core values of the Latinx community is family -- we stand by each other and grow strong because of that.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?My culture and lived experiences helped create who I am today. Argentinian culture has shaped my values, my point of view, and the way I build relationships. My experience with immigration helped me embark on an identity-defining journey. In this journey, I surrounded myself with other Latinx immigrants and grew from learning about their cultures. My household is now Mexican-Argentinean. We eat quesadillas for breakfast and parrilladas on Sundays, I love it here.How do you share your culture & community on and off of TikTok?I carry my culture with me everywhere I go. It shapes my perspective and the relationships I forge. On TikTok, my culture shows in how I contextualize a trend, in my warm relationship with my followers, and when I highlight emerging Latinx designers. Off TikTok, I share my culture through music (my obsession with Soda Stereo), food (the sunday parrilladas at my place), and inviting Latino and non-Latino friends to soccer watch parties at the Cafe Argentino in Brooklyn.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has inspired me to be my most authentic self and celebrate my cultural differences and similarities. When you are an immigrant, you try to assimilate to your new home as much as possible. TikTok taught me that I shouldn't lose myself in that process. A simple example is my accent -- I used to be self- conscious of sounding different, which is why the first videos on my account have no voice. My audience started asking me for more context for each trend and I dared to speak in one video. The level of support and the amount of people saying \"Omg love your accent,\" and \"I can listen to you for hours\" cured me from my fears.What video are you most proud of creating?The subversive basics video. I've seen a lot of articles talk about \"the cutout trend,\" \"the sheer trend,\" \"the keyhole trend,\" \"the deconstructed trend,\" and although those are all design elements I had seen trending, I kept on thinking about how that's it's not really a \"trend.\"In the video, I explained the cultural context behind these trending design elements and named the trend \"subversive basics.\" I also used it as an opportunity to celebrate rising Latinx fashion design talent -- I featured Clarissa Larrazabal and she sold out in 3 days. Today, the subversive basics trend was picked up by major news publications including Hypebeast and Refinery29.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?To not be afraid to use their voice. For fear of prosecution during the last administration, I got used to hiding and being silent. When I started my TikTok account, I was still afraid to use my voice... what if my accent gave me away?! The TikTok community helped me gain courage and realize that I have as much right to be loud as everyone else.

We're also continuing our commitment to uplift the next generation of leaders, because securing a platform that brings joy to over 1 billion people is a job that's never done.Cybersecurity awareness championsWe're always inspired by creators fueling #LearnOnTikTok, and we're excited to launch a new @TikTokTips video series on ways to spot and defend against common cyberthreats. The series will feature TikTok creators and employees, including TikTok Chief Security Officer Roland Cloutier and moderately successful touring comedian @alex_falcone telling tales of cyber crimes and how to #BeCyberSmart.In the physical world, we follow expert guidance: \"If you see something, say something.\" The same principle applies to the digital world, and people with cybersecurity skills have the power to protect those around them by sharing their expertise. We look forward to celebrating fellow cybersecurity awareness champions who are making a positive impact on our community like @GhufranSalih, @DanTechTalk, and @EngineerAmber.Uplifting the next generation of leadersOur commitment to keeping TikTok safe and secure includes investing in technology, people, and partnerships to support the next-generation of cybersecurity leaders. While the COVID-19 pandemic hit many industries hard, cybersecurity skills have never been needed more. With over 3 million cybersecurity jobs left vacant last year, we're continuing to provide tools, training, and encouragement to inspire more people to get into cybersecurity.We're also uplifting the cyber-learning community by officially welcoming the NCSA to TikTok (@natlcybersecalliance), along with ongoing support for its free Cybersecurity Education and Career Resources Library. Whether you're a high school student or mid-career changer, the field of cybersecurity offers something for everyone.Fostering a culture of cybersecurityWe love seeing authenticity and creativity spark trends on TikTok and drive culture in the physical world. Detecting and protecting against cyberthreats is paramount to safeguard the platform as a home for creative self-expression, entertainment, and joy. That's why we build security into our product and processes, including getting creative to foster an internal culture of cybersecurity. This summer, we developed and launched a security-themed video game to engage, educate, and empower our diverse workforce. We also continued our internal \"Mission Possible\" series headlined by TikTok Chief Security Officer Roland Cloutier. Whether it's \"Roland's password kitchen\" or \"gone phishin'\" video, a panel discussion with the global security and privacy team members, or a live \"Security Feud\" trivia competition, \"Mission Possible\" is another way we engage TikTok employees as our first line of defense against online threats.We believe people are the foundation of any organization. To keep tackling next-generation security challenges, we're continuing to broaden our bench of global security and privacy leaders in key regions, including Washington DC, Mountain View, Los Angeles, Dublin, and Singapore. We recently hosted a TikTok and LinkedIn LIVE to introduce members of the global security team, discussing a range of topics from building monitoring, response, and investigative Fusion Centers to our \"follow the sun\" approach to detect and respond to critical incidents in real-time.Testing our own defensesOver 1 billion people now come to TikTok every month to be entertained as they learn, laugh, or discover something new. We take our duty to protect their data very seriously. We embrace opportunities to collaborate with trusted third-party experts to help validate our defenses and stay ahead of next-generation threats. This month marks our one-year anniversary of partnering with HackerOne, a leading hacker-powered security platform. Our partnership welcomes top security researchers, academics, and independent experts to share advanced insights into emerging vulnerabilities, allowing our teams to resolve them before attackers can exploit them.

Her TikTok account is filled with day-to-day snippets of life in her classroom alongside her long-running Bad Bunny fandom. When she's not teaching, you can find her (safely) traveling the world to get closer to her goal of visiting every continent. Read more below to find out how Sofia finds inspiration in the community and her culture!What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?I feel proud to come from a culture that is so diverse. I will forever have my own roots and traditions that I will be able to pass on and teach to my own kids. I am able to say that I come from a strong and empowering history that is constantly growing and making change in the world.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?Being Latina made me understand what it was like to be different and it opened my eyes to be very aware of the diverse world we live in. It taught me to be accepting of others no matter where they come from, which shaped me into the person and teacher I am today. Knowing my family's history made me strive to succeed -- not to be better, but to prove that being Latina won’t stop me from achieving my goals and standing up for what I believe in.How do you share your culture & community on and off of TikTok?My culture is a part of who I am. I love to incorporate it within my classroom so my students can be very aware of the diverse world we live in. It’s a way to teach them to be accepting of others no matter where they come from, and I am able to connect with the students who share the same culture as me. On TikTok I love to share that I am Latina teacher to inspire others and prove that you can become anything you dream of and being Latinx won’t stop that.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has been an amazing community to be a part of. I began posting videos on viral trends only, but seeing other creators be themselves on the app inspired me to post about my own interests and made me want to become greater. I have met and connected with so many positive, inspiring and strong individuals that motivate and inspire me to be the best that I can be in everything I create.What video are you most proud of creating?The video I am most proud of to date was the Happy Birthday Video for Bad Bunny. This is a video that I created with my kindergarten class where I told them it was his birthday and they wanted to wish him a happy birthday. Not only did this video get shared all over, but Bad Bunny himself reposted it! When the kids found out, they couldn’t believe it and it brought so much joy to all of us that our favorite artist noticed us! It just goes to show the power of TikTok!What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?This is one of the tips that I heard the most when I started creating: BE YOURSELF! A lot of times new creators find themselves stuck on creating new content because they are trying to fit a “standard.” This is a creator's biggest mistake. You have to create what makes you happy and put out what you’re proud of. There’s nothing like making a video that you didn’t like, and then it doesn’t do well so you feel like you wasted your time. Create genuine content that shows who you are and your audience will love it!Who are some Latinx creators that everyone should be following/watching?These are some of the creators who have inspired me: @candylover89official, @peachypollo, @leogonzall, @lexdelvalle, @theivanemilio, and @vanessacsirias![Trailblazer illustrations created by Brazillian artist Niege Borges for TikTok's Latinx Heritage Month celebration]"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-enter-autumn-aesthetic","date":"2021-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: Enter Autumn Aesthetic","text":"While TikTok was passing a billion monthly users, creators led an NFT launch and pumpkin spiced up their videos with Autumn Aesthetic.

Read below to find out more about how he finds inspiration through community. What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?Being a part of the Latinx community is a huge deal to me. Since I am Afro-Latino I've grown up not knowing where I belong. I've dealt with hardships such as prejudice and isolation and it has been tough. At home I only speak Spanish -- I was taught to love my rich complexion and embrace every curl and kink -- but there was always a disconnect with the outside world. I never saw myself or people like me on traditional media. However, the ignorance of others has never stopped me from embracing my roots.I grew up waking up every Saturday to my mom blasting baladas romanticas, going over to my prima's sala for a holiday parties and listening to Thalia. Being Latinx is ALL ABOUT CULTURE. We are proud of who we are and wear it with pride. So no matter if others can't comprehend my Latinidad -- it doesn't take away from me.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?My culture has shaped my comedy which is something I use on the daily. From my comedic timing and the way that I speak to my mannerisms, it all comes from being Dominican. Dominicans are naturally very funny people so I draw from that when in my daily life and when content creating.How do you share your culture & community on and off of TikTok?My culture and community is highlighted in everything that I do. At school, I was the head choreographer and president of the only Latin dance team on campus. We performed all genres of music and would go around to different schools performing and competing. But our purpose went beyond the stage. Our goal was to showcase and educate others on the Latino culture. There was a small percentage of Latinx students on campus so with the help of the Latino Student Union (which I was also apart of) we held events, cooked food and had open conversations about the difficulties of being a minority in an attempt to make everyone feel welcomed.When it comes to online, I vocally express my experience with being Dominican and everything that comes with that. The good, bad and ugly, I talk about it all!How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok to me is a safe haven. On other apps, no matter how genuine or transparent you are with your followers, it seems to me like people aren't their true authentic selves. However, on TikTok that's a different story. I feel comfortable getting on LIVE or making a video when I just wake up! I can see one video on my For You Page and feel connected to a person because we're all living our truths on the app. We talk about our struggles, successes, fears and hopes for the future. Not to mention, it has given me a platform that I could've never imagined. I've been making videos for fun on the internet for years and it wasn't until TikTok that I felt purpose. It inspires me to keep going and creating because you never know who's day you can change with one video. I've gained a community of friends especially from other Latinx creators that I am grateful for. No matter what part of Latin America we come from we all have shared experiences and I love seeing that on the app.What video are you most proud of creating?I love all my videos equally because it takes the same time and effort into creating all of them BUT if I had to choose one I would say my Dominicans in Bridgerton video. I remember binge watching the show with my friend and my mind was going YOU HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING. I think what makes that video so special is that, I was staying at a friends house while I filmed that so I didn't have access to all my wigs and wardrobe but I think I still nailed the look. Even my friend was surprised when I told her I filmed it using things I found around her house. Not to mention, I got so much love from the community and other creators.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?My number rule is to not force anything when recording. I understand the difficulties of recording and I too schedule shoot days but if your energy is low or you're not feeling whatever you're doing, it will translate on camera.HOP ON EVERY TREND! No matter if its fashion, beauty or dance there is a way to adapt that trend and make it work for you and your content.Don't be afraid to thinking outside the box.

Ana is a Latina creator who uses her platform to pass down delicious traditional recipes to the next generation. She used her free time during the pandemic and her passion for food as motivation to break out her kitchen appliances and start cooking in a virtual setting! Through TikTok, she has created a visual cookbook consisting of everything from flavorful desserts, to appetizing dinners, to refreshing beverages. Read more below about how Ana's culture has inspired and influenced her recipes:What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?Being a part of the Latinx community is a great opportunity to share my heritage, which I am very proud of.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?In my culture, family is very important! We don't wait for holidays to come around to bring the family together. This means music, delicious Mexican food, and games! Keeping traditions like, El Dia del Grito (September 15), which is Mexican Independence Day, El Dia de Los Muertos, and other important traditional holidays are important for me to share so that my family can pass them on to their children and grandchildren. We were also taught at a very young age to work for our dreams! Being a migrant child, I was brought up with very hard working parents, who taught us that hard work and determination is the only way to achieve your dreams.How do you share your culture & community on and off of TikTok?I share my culture every day on TikTok with videos about traditional dishes and off TikTok I share my culture with friends and neighbors by bringing homemade Mexican Cuisine to the table.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has a wonderful and diverse culture that is absolutely the best. It has inspired me to bring my traditional recipes to the homes of families everywhere.What video are you most proud of creating?I have two videos that I am so proud of creating. One is the \"Rosca de Reyes\" video -- I love to share my culture and teach others the reason why we enjoy certain foods. The second one is my \"Lazy Enchiladas\" video. I created this to respond to a comment saying my traditional enchiladas were lazy. This video took off like I never would have imagined! This was shared many times on Tiktok and other platforms including news stations, Right this Minute, and a few others. I will definitely be sharing more lazy recipes in the future!What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?Some of my viral videos have been the ones I spent the least amount of time on, or video ideas I thought were silly at the time or not good enough. For example again, my Lazy Enchiladas! I debated whether to upload the video for days! No idea is dumb, create what is on your mind and have fun doing so!Who are some Latinx creators that everyone should be following/watching?The three latin creators I follow that always put a smile on my face are @es_jenny_solares, @estefisaavy, and @estebanleyte. Also @paoladyee -- she has the most unique, kid friendly treats for kids and me of course![Trailblazer illustrations created by Brazillian artist Niege Borges for TikTok's Latinx Heritage Month celebration]"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-jonnym-0-rales","date":"2021-09-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @jonnym0rales","text":"TikTok is a home for creators to celebrate their unique perspectives, share their stories, and educate their communities. Up next on our Creator Spotlight Series is Jonny Morales, known on TikTok as @jonnym0rales.Jonny is the epitome of what it means to embrace your culture as he often encourages his fans to share their culture with others. With the help of his Mexican mother, he creates content that showcases popular Hispanic dishes, snacks, music, and traditions. He also invites his American girlfriend along for the ride to show how fun and exciting it is to break down the cultural barriers. Tune in to TikTok LIVE on September 17 at 5PM PT/ 8PM ET via @TikTok to hear more from Jonny on how his culture has inspired him, and read below to find out more about his journey on TikTok!What does it mean to you to be part of the Latinx community?Being a part of the Latinx community means being a part of something bigger than yourself. It means making memories together, and sharing them with the world to bring ever-lasting joy.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?Growing up, finding my identity was the thing I struggled with the most. I couldn't figure out how to balance being Mexican and American, since I was being told I couldn't really be both, or at least not completely both. This pushed me to discover that it has never been about picking one or the other. It has always been about learning to embrace my roots, and share them with others so that they can do the same with their background. And through sharing, I am inviting people to become a part of my family, and be a part of the Latinx family. Family truly is everything, but it's not exclusive to people with a specific background. The Latinx family has open arms to anyone who accepts the invitation!How do you share your culture & community on and off of TikTok?On TikTok, I dedicate my videos to displaying the excitement and fun that comes with the Latinx community. Off of TikTok, I am at school studying Spanish and Biology in hopes of becoming a Medical Interpreter. I get the opportunity weekly to volunteer as an interpreter with a local clinic that specializes in providing healthcare to underprivileged individuals. A lot of the times, these individuals are Hispanic, so I am able to step in and make sure these people are heard and understood. Through this, I am able to teach the staff at the clinic about the Latinx community, such as everyday Spanish phrases that they can use in conversation.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has reshaped the definition of \"home\" for me. Home isn't where you sleep, or go to at the end of a long day to rest. Home is a place where you are welcomed as you are, and are able to find comfort and rest. I feel more than welcomed to be a part of the TikTok community, and I find comfort in the videos that the platform motivates me to make. I am also able to find rest since I do not feel pressured or required to meet unattainable expectations from social media. TikTok feels like home.What video are you most proud of creating?This video is super interesting to me for many reasons! It speaks a lot, without using actual words! To summarize it, it was during a trend called the \"photogenic trend\", where you take pictures randomly of yourself to see if you're \"photogenic\". Well, I thought it would be funny to do a different take on it where I totally FAIL because my mom interrupts to tell me I have to clean the house! (Super relatable thing amongst youth, since we always have to clean in a Hispanic household!) Well not only did the video do well, but it also gained traction in other countries! As I was translating the comments that were in other languages, it was people saying they relate to the video because they too had a parent who was the same way! I found it so incredible how this comedic video that had no words, just movement and a fun song was so relatable to many across the world! (Regardless of a language barrier). Comedy is a worldwide language.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?My favorite tip to give is to always write down your ideas! Whether it's a word, an item you want to use, or a concept that you have, write it down! Doing this will help you work towards making that video come to life! It'll serve as a reminder that there is a story you have to tell, and it will encourage you to jump on it! We all always have ideas all the time, but it can be hard to remember everything when our creative minds are consistently running. Writing things down will not only statistically improve your ability to fully remember your ideas, but it will also become a tangible first step to creating content that matters to you.Who are some Latinx creators that everyone should be following/watching?A Latinx creator that we should all be following/watching is @leogonzall!! HE IS HILARIOUS. He is easily one of the best at using comedy to bring so much laughter to our platform.

I saw that other creators were using their platform to create miracles for strangers in their communities and I wanted to do the same for the Latinx community.What video are you most proud of creating?I’m most proud of the video where I gifted a street vendor $20,000 in cash. I never would’ve imagined giving someone that much money in my life.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?Create content that you LOVE making.

For some, that includes sharing life experiences and finding comfort in knowing that they are not alone in what they are going through - whether it's new parents talking about how to cope with the lack of sleep or mindfulness tips to manage anxiety.We're inspired by how our community openly, honestly and creatively shares about important issues such as mental well-being or body image, and how they lift each other up and lend help during difficult times.We care deeply about our community, and we always look for new ways in which we can nurture their well-being. That's why we're taking additional steps to make it easier for people to find resources when they need them on TikTok.Additional well-being resources to support our communityWhile we don’t allow content that promotes, glorifies or normalizes suicide, self-harm or eating disorders, we do support people who choose to share their experiences to raise awareness, help others who might be struggling and find support among our community.To help our community do this safely, we've rolled out new well-being guides to support people who choose to share their personal experiences on our platform, developed with the guidance of the International Association for Suicide Prevention, Crisis Text Line, Live For Tomorrow, Samaritans of Singapore and Samaritans (UK). The guides, which are available on our Safety Center for informational purposes only, also offer tips to help our community members responsibly engage with someone who may be struggling or in distress.In addition, we're featuring curated content from our partner organizations to learn about and explore important well-being issues. This in-app programming is currently live, having started September 10 and running through September 16.Expanded guide on eating disordersEarlier this year, we rolled out new features to support users who may be living with or recovering from an eating disorder. When a user searches for terms related to eating disorders, we provide them with suggested tools and direct them to appropriate resources. We've also introduced permanent public service announcements (PSAs) on certain hashtags, such as #whatIeatinaday, to increase awareness and provide support for our community.We're now expanding these resources with a new Safety Center guide on eating disorders for teens, caregivers, and educators. Developed in consultation with independent experts including the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), National Eating Disorder Information Centre, Butterfly Foundation, and Bodywhys, this guide will provide information, support and advice on eating disorders.\"In the United States, 30 million Americans will experience an eating disorder at some point in their lives. The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) commends TikTok for continuing to find ways to both support its community and bring awareness to these serious, yet treatable, illnesses. These new resources will make information easily accessible on TikTok.\" -- Elizabeth Thompson, Interim CEO, NEDAExpanding search interventionsWhen someone searches for words or phrases such as #suicide, we'll direct them to local support resources such as the Crisis Text Line helpline, where they can find support and information about treatment options.Following consultation with independent experts, we've also provided our community with content from our creators where they share their personal experiences with mental well-being, information on where to seek support and advice on how to talk to loved ones about these issues. These videos will appear in search results for certain terms related to suicide or self-harm, with our community able to opt-in to view should they wish to.\"Through their partnership with TikTok, Crisis Text Line is able to provide access to free, 24/7 crisis counseling via text to anyone who finds themselves in crisis; however, they define it. TikTok reaches millions of people so we know these changes will have a profound impact and help many people move from a hot moment to a cool calm.\" -- Maggie Farah, Senior Director of Business Development, Crisis Text LineStrengthening our notices on search resultsAs part of our ongoing efforts to keep our community safe, we will also be updating our existing warning label for sensitive content. Beginning in September, when a user searches for terms that may bring up content that some may find distressing, for example ‘scary make-up’, the search results page will be covered with an opt-in viewing screen. Individuals will be able to click 'Show results' to continue to see the content. The opt-in viewing screens already appear on top of videos that some may find graphic or distressing, with this type of content ineligible for recommendation into anyone's For You feed.We’re proud that our platform has become a place where people can share their personal experiences with mental well-being, find community and support each other, and we take very seriously our responsibility to keep TikTok a safe space for these important conversations.The guides and resources shared on our platform are purely for informational purposes and are not intended to be a substitute for professional or medical advice.

When people feel included they're more comfortable expressing themselves fully and engaging with others, which is why we place great emphasis on fostering an inclusive environment.That's why we've continued to invest in products and tools to help make TikTok accessible to everyone. In recognition of Deaf Awareness Month, we're spotlighting the creators who uplift this community on TikTok. Additionally, we want to encourage our entire community to make their videos more accessible by using our auto captions feature launched earlier this year.The creators who inspire usFrom educating others about daily life, to sharing American Sign Language (ASL) phrases that everyone should know, there are so many inspiring creators on TikTok advocating for people who are deaf and hard of hearing. And their content is reaching millions of users; since the start of this year, #DeafTikTok has had over 245 million views and climbing. Read on to find out more about three creators who have become a source of inspiration to others.@bree.k.jones (Bree Jones)Bree is an ASL interpreter, producer and writer. She is passionate about educating the hearing world about the culture and language of the deaf community, so that hearing people can recognize and act upon things that they may not have known about deaf people.@scarlet_may.1 (Scarlet May)Scarlet Watters is a 20-year-old deaf creator. She makes videos on TikTok that vary from comedy, to educating on the deaf community, to ASL covers and more. Over the past year she has amassed a following of 4.4 million followers on TikTok.@slntwrlddd (Otis Jones)Otis is a creator from Atlanta, GA. He teaches ASL classes during his free time and has a passion for hearing people to learn ASL with respect and courtesy for the deaf community.To hear more from these creators on how they're making an impact on the community, check out their creator spotlight post here.Adding auto captions to videosWe want everyone on TikTok to be able to create and watch content, and to foster connections with others. As part of our push to make TikTok more accessible, earlier this year we introduced auto captions to help people who are deaf or hard of hearing better use and enjoy TikTok. Auto captions automatically generate subtitles, allowing viewers to read or listen to content.Any creator can add auto captions to their videos—and we encourage you to do so! It makes a huge difference in providing a better experience for our deaf and hard of hearing users. To turn them on, select auto captions in the editing page after you have uploaded or recorded a video. Text is automatically transcribed and displayed on your content.Working with deaf and hard of hearing advocacy organizationsWe see tremendous value in partnering with external experts and organizations, whether they're experts on family safety, well-being, or accessibility. As we focus on making TikTok more accessible to all, we proactively work with organizations like the National Association of the Deaf and regularly seeking their guidance.The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) strives to ensure that deaf and hard of hearing people are included and represented in all new technologies and innovations, to end the often repeated cycle of being left behind. We applaud the willingness of TikTok to engage with us to share accessibility feedback, raise issues and concerns impacting our community, and amplify deaf and hard of hearing creators,\" said Howard A. Rosenblum, NAD CEO. \"The NAD appreciates the commitment shown by TikTok to elevating inclusion and accessibility of their platform for deaf and hard of hearing people, and we look forward to a productive partnership.\"When content is more accessible, it helps reach a larger audience because more people are able to enjoy the content. And we believe that an inclusive environment empowers people to freely express themselves and engage with their community. We’re working hard to better serve everyone in our community, and will continue to share news and updates around our accessibility improvements."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-celebrating-deaf-awareness-month","date":"2021-09-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: Celebrating Deaf Awareness Month","text":"At TikTok, we're inspired every day to see the strong, diverse communities that are forming and building connections.

These three creators are using their creativity, voices and platforms to advocate for the deaf and hard of hearing community both on and off TikTok.Get to know more about each creator below, including their tips for making your content more accessible!Meet the Creators@bree.k.jones (Bree Jones)Bree is an ASL interpreter, producer and writer. She is passionate about educating the hearing world about the culture and language of the deaf community, so that hearing people can recognize and act upon things that they may not have known about deaf people. Because many are also unfamiliar with the interpreting field, she also spends time shining a light on how the field operates. Bree’s hope is to one day see a world where the deaf and hearing community are intertwined with each other to the point where accessibility will become second nature for society. I'm proud of this video because these terms (especially hearing impaired) are still commonly used to refer to the deaf community. I was proud that so many people learned that the deaf community as a whole only wants to be labeled as deaf or hard of hearing. Because of their new found knowledge, I believe they are actively doing their best to change their vocabulary.@scarlet_may.1 (Scarlet May)Scarlet Watters is a 20-year-old deaf creator. She makes videos on TikTok that vary from comedy, to educating on the deaf community, to ASL covers and more. Over the past year she has amassed a following of 4.4 million followers on TikTok. I'm proud of this video because it has opened many peoples eyes to not being accessible and I feel it has helped the platform in a way -- people started captioning their videos. I’m all about making a change for the better so I’m proud I was able to spread awareness.@slntwrlddd (Otis Jones)Otis Jones is a creator from Atlanta, Georgia. He is the only deaf person in his family and went to Berkmar High School, fully mainstreamed with an interpreter. Otis wears a Cochlear implant and a hearing aid and enjoys performing music with the art of ASL intertwined. Otis teaches ASL classes during his free time and has a passion for hearing people to learn ASL with respect and courtesy for the deaf community. My favorite TikTok is, of course, the video with my beautiful mother signing along with me.Bree, Otis and Scarlet's Tips on Making your Content AccessibleWhat advice would you give to someone using the auto captions feature on TikTok for the first time?@bree.k.jones: Please be sure to make edits to your auto captions -- go through your video, make sure what you really said matches what the captions say.@scarlet_may.1: Definitely use the auto captions feature. But if that is not available to you I would recommend typing out your own captions as well if you want everyone to be included!@slntwrlddd: My advice would be not to be nervous but to be appreciative because by putting on auto captions, you are making your content accessible to a new audience. With auto captions you are gaining more respect and love from the deaf/hard of hearing community. It is really that easy.What guidance would you give to a creator to help them make their content accessible?@bree.k.jones: Caption all your videos. Those who are deaf or hard of hearing want to enjoy your awesome content as well. Caption everything, not some of the things.@scarlet_may.1: Definitely use the auto captions feature. But if that is not accessible to you I would recommend typing out your own captions as well if you want everyone to be included!@slntwrlddd: Before, you had to type in your captions, which now, looking back can be hard to do. Now you can click auto captions on your video! This gives you no excuse on why your content cannot be accessible for the deaf/hard of hearing community. Also, always spotlight deaf creators when you do anything that is related to the deaf community’s culture.If someone who would like to learn ASL or BASL, where should they start?@bree.k.jones: BASL is not as commonly known as it used to be. There's a rich history behind it, so if you're interested, please research it.Check out your local community college and take up ASL classes there if they offer it. Once you take up those classes, take advantage of going to deaf events and meeting members of the deaf community. Another thing that can be done is following deaf creators on TikTok who teach ASL such as @deaffamilymatters, @slntwrlddd, @shaheemsanchez and @itscharmay. Once you start interacting with one page, more pages will begin to pop up on your fyp, giving an advantage of learning more signs and phrases. Another thing that can be done is researching deaf groups on FaceBook that are in your local area.@scarlet_may.1: Don’t give up, and make sure to socialize yourself with the deaf community! You will pick it up faster that way and also make friends within the deaf/hard of hearing community. There’s websites online, classes online/in person, books so many ways to learn! But make sure you’re learning from a deaf person! Overall we appreciate your willingness to learn for us!@slntwrlddd: Put yourself in a deaf environment where their language is exposed to you. That way, you will pick up even faster, learn slang, and see the diversity in how each deaf person signs. Also, always follow deaf creators content and always learn from a deaf person who knows the culture, struggles as a deaf person, and of course, the language itself more than a hearing person would.What you Can Do to Be InclusiveWe encourage all creators to add auto captions to their videos, to make their content more enjoyable for everyone. To turn them on, select auto captions in the editing page after you have uploaded or recorded a video. Text is automatically transcribed and displayed on your content.At TikTok, we stand with all of our diverse communities, including our users who are deaf or hard of hearing. We hope you enjoyed learning more about some of the creators using their platforms to inspire change and lift others up - be sure to follow @bree.k.jones, @scarlet_may.1, and @slntwrlddd on TikTok!"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-love-you-like-i-can","date":"2021-09-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: Love you \"Like I Can\"","text":"TikTok creators document the challenges from Hurricane Ida.

We recognize that for caregivers, it can feel overwhelming trying to keep up with evolving trends or new platforms, and talking about online safety with their teens can seem daunting.We also hear from teens that they want their voices to be heard and listened to. We want to help simplify things by offering caregivers insight on the support teens really value from the trusted adults in their lives - and who better to advise on what they need than teens themselves.In that spirit, we are expanding Family Pairing by adding advice for parents developed in collaboration with teens and online youth safety experts at Internet Matters.Parent or guardian accounts currently linked to a teen's account via Family Pairing will receive a notification prompting them to find out more about the support teens would like and their suggestions on how to approach conversations about digital literacy and safety.Starting today, any new parent or caregiver that enables Family Pairing will receive these insights upon signing up, which are also available on the Guardian's Guide section of our Safety Center.Here's the support teens would like from caregivers as they navigate their online experience:\"Help me understand the rules\" - Teens don't expect trusted adults to be experts on every platform, but they value support to set up their accounts. This includes help to check and understand privacy and safety settings. They also told us parents shouldn't be afraid to set boundaries; teens expect and even welcome them.\"Be available to chat\" - Teens want trusted adults to be interested in their digital life and to recognise how important the online world is to them. Be available to chat, and don't be afraid to initiate a conversation.\"Don't panic when things go wrong\" - Your teen has come to you for help - fantastic! They may be feeling vulnerable, scared, embarrassed, or upset, so let them know how pleased you are they've come to you, listen without recriminations, ask questions and focus on solutions.\"Trust me\" - Teens get that trust has to be earned and expect adult oversight, but they feel greater autonomy is appropriate as they get older. Every family is different and the pace at which a teen moves toward the independent use of technology will vary, but if your teen knows how to navigate platforms safely and they come to you when things go wrong, that's a great foundation for trust.\"Respect my privacy\" - Striking a balance between a teenager's expectation of privacy and ensuring they are safe is one of the trickiest aspects of parenting - both on and offline. It can be tough when a teen tells you they'd rather you didn't follow them on a platform. It's natural to worry they're up to mischief when really it's likely they just want some space to hang out with friends without being monitored.CEO of Internet Matters, Carolyn Bunting (MBE), said: “At Internet Matters, we believe that involving young people in conversations about internet safety is key to understanding the challenges and opportunities they experience online.“It’s encouraging to see TikTok taking a positive step by supporting meaningful conversations among families to help them use tech safely.“While we welcome this new initiative, the work to create a safe environment for children and young people to be online is only just beginning and there is more that needs to be done across the whole industry. In the meantime we urge parents to have regular open conversations with their children about their digital life as they build their online presence. These tips from teens are a good way to start.”"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/you-are-invited-to-tiktok-world","date":"2021-08-31T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"You're invited to TikTok World","text":"When we launched TikTok For Business in June 2020, we aimed to create a home for brands and marketers to be creative storytellers and meaningfully engage with the broader communities around them.

Check out our first two posts to find out more about the For You experience and tips for creators.On TikTok, there's a world of content to explore with every swipe, search, and scroll.Discovery begins in your For You feed, where you'll find entertaining, inspiring content that’s recommended to you based on your interests – but there are all kinds of ways to explore more from the many communities on TikTok.In this post, we continue to highlight one of TikTok's most defining features, with tips that can help you discover more creators and content you love.Discover trending contentFrom trending effects like #TimeWarpScan to the paw-sitively adorable videos shared on #PetsOfTikTok, the Discover page makes it easy to see what's currently capturing the interest of our community and jump into the fun of what's popular on the app - from trends to effects, and sounds on the rise. As you scroll, you’ll also be able to enjoy content and draw inspiration from previous trends.Keeping up with your favorite creatorsTo see more from creators whose content you enjoy, tap the \"+\" on their profile photo in your For You feed or the Follow button on their Profile page. As you follow new creators, their content will start showing up in your Following feed, which surfaces some of the latest and most relevant content from accounts you follow.Search for content you loveSearching on TikTok is easy - just head to the Discover page where you can search for what you’re looking for, from hashtags to videos, creators, and sounds. Exploring these results can also help expand your viewing experience in your For You and Following feeds, as interactions like following an account, saving a video to Favorites, or liking or commenting on a video you've discovered through Search can help shape your future content recommendations.We build safeguards into the Search experience too. For example, a search for eating disorder terms may surface expert resources and support organizations, and a search for content that violates our Community Guidelines may redirect you to those guidelines for a refresher on our policies.Expanding discovery in your For You feedYour video interactions – such as likes, shares, and comments – help our recommendation system gauge your interest in different kinds of content. You can also indicate your preferences by responding to in-feed surveys, which ask you for feedback about videos you come across in your feed.Just like you can long-press to add a video to your Favorites, you can also long-press on a video and tap \"Not Interested\" to indicate that you'd like to see less of a type of video. Choosing to hide videos from a given creator or made with a certain sound, or reporting a video that seems out of line with our guidelines, will also help shape your For You feed.From time to time, you may also come across videos in your feed that don't seem relevant to your expressed interests. This is an important part of our approach to recommendations: bringing a diversity of videos into your For You feed gives you additional opportunities to stumble upon new content categories and discover new creators as you swipe through.With our built-in discovery features, your feed becomes not just a place to watch videos and LIVEs you already love, but a portal to explore content from all across the TikTok universe."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-collegetok","date":"2021-08-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: #CollegeTok","text":"As universities across the country and getting back into swing of #CollegeLife, we've seen some amazing creators sharing their experiences and advice on TikTok. From #OOTDs, to #bamarush, to scholarship tips, to dorm aesthetics, students are using TikTok to show how they're getting ready for the new school year.For our Creator Spotlight Series, we chatted with @espdaniella and @MandaPandie about all things college, including their tips for other student creators. Read more below to hear more about their time on TikTok and their advice to students and other creators alike!How did you get started on TikTok?@espdaniella: I got started earlier this year in January after I finally took the advice of my followers on other platforms. And I must say that it was the best decision I could have possibly made! From being a part of the TikTok for Black Creatives Program, the exposure for what I do to help students win scholarships, and being nominated for Adcolor’s TikTok Creator Award — I simply am beyond grateful for this platform.@MandaPandie: I got started on TikTok trying to connect with my friends and family on the app.What video are you most proud of creating?@espdaniella: There are two videos that come to mind. The first one being when I live-streamed my college graduation on TikTok. I wanted my following to be a part of that moment because many who follow me are or will be first-generation college students. I always try to find ways to not only educate others, but also inspire because you need motivation before you are willing to do something. Another video is this one where I gave scholarship advice to a single mother looking to go to and fund nursing school. In a time of where there is a shortage of medical professionals needed to fight against COVID-19 and for other medical treatment, I hope that I was able to do my part to encourage more people to take on the medical field and not have finances prevent them from pursuing an education in doing so. Also as a result of that video my book, The Scholarship Algorithm, sold many copies overnight, and months later I have heard so many winner success stories from those who read it! @MandaPandie: I am most proud of a painting I did of Malcom X. What do you love most about TikTok?@espdaniella: I love the algorithm on this app. It does a much better job of promoting my content in comparison to other platforms that I had been on for years thanks to the FYP feature. I finally feel appreciated here and I am able to reach more students, educators, and families thanks to it.@MandaPandie: I love that the community is confident enough to interact with each other as humans even though we are on digital platform. This makes it easier for influencers and the community to build a bond stronger than basic marketing or even intentional marketing. TikTok is, and will hopefully remain, a safe place for creators to connect with the community without the usual limitations.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators who are in college?@espdaniella: Don’t be afraid to invest in yourself. It will be worth it in the end. Also, express yourself more and experiment with different video types— whether that be dueting, stitching, making skits — whatever it may be. And once you find something that really resonates with your audience, stick to it and seek ways to make that theme/aesthetic even better!@MandaPandie: Make and post original content. Connect personally by showing your authentic self. For example, if you love to cook, be sure to tell your audience what type of cuisine it is or if it's your first time making it. Share your College experience! Remember that your audience includes students from your school and you are representing that community as well. Stay positive! Do not over work yourself because it can become overwhelming at any point in time.With #dorm and #dormessentials trending on platform, at 299M views and 47M views respectively, what is the one item you think everyone needs in their dorm room and why?@espdaniella: College students need an air purifier. I was a resident assistant (RA) at my university for two years and let me tell you — the things that I would smell in the hallway were ... questionable, to say the least. So if you want to lessen the odors of must, smoke, burnt food, etc — you need this! Also, earplugs or noise cancellation earphones because your neighbors may be loud (mine were horror gamers and always screaming) and you could have thin walls.@MandaPandie: You need a comfortable and quiet space to study efficiently. I like to listen to music with my headphones on and chill on fluffy pillows. I also like dim lighting because I use my iPad often. Make sure your lighting is comfortable so your eyes and vision can be healthy. I turn off my larger light and turn on my reading light often.What is the best money saving advice you can give to college students?@espdaniella: Right now is the best time to apply for scholarships. Most of the bigger awards that give more money/full-rides have deadlines anywhere between now and early January. Think of applying for scholarships as a job or investment that will pay you sooner or later. Just imagine — you spend three hours on three applications, win one of them, and that one just so happens to be worth $9,000. You literally just got paid $3,000 per hour of work. I don’t know about you, but I can’t think of a single job that will get you an hourly payment like that. So get to it guys!@MandaPandie: The best money saving advice I can give to college students is to eat out only on the weekends if you can. Utilize the meal plan or the kitchenette. Food can get expensive especially if you are in an urban setting. Be grateful and allow abundance to flow into your life!What advice would you give to an incoming college student?@espdaniella: Trick yourself about deadlines for assignments, scholarships, internships, etc when writing out due dates on your calendar. If you are a procrastinator like me, you may jeopardize your grades or certain opportunities simply because you did not turn in your stuff on time. Also, preferably use a digital calendar rather than physical because then you get sound-alerts reminding you to get it done!@MandaPandie: Relax and focus on your studies. College is a big step! Parties and other temptations will be there constantly, but your assignment is due today so prioritize and you will succeed! Use a planner, your phone calendar, and/or a notebook to create daily to-do list to stay on task."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/gimmegimmegimmeabbaontiktok","date":"2021-08-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Gimme!

On TikTok, la #FamiliaLatina is made up of users, creators, and artists who trace their roots back to Latin American countries from around the world. Whether it's celebrating their culture, breaking down stereotypes, inspiring people to enjoy life through authentic content, or just creating relatable and funny clips, Latinx creators are making an impact across culture and entertainment. From el papá de TikTok, Vinny the Twister, to the falling backwards trend using \"Bamboleo\" by Gipsy Kings and the #TortillaTrend, Latinx digital entertainers are entertaining fans with their creations every day.We're driven to spotlight and support Latinx talent with a platform that amplifies their voices and a community that is moved by them. Today, we're excited to announce \"TikTok Latinx Creatives,\" a new incubator program that will invest in and support emerging Latinx creators and music artists on TikTok. The 10-week program will focus on nurturing and developing 150 talented Latinx creators and music artists, aiming to further grow and develop an already thriving Latinx creative community on TikTok.We're also reuniting with MACRO, the multiplatform media company that represents the voice and perspectives of Black people and persons of color, to advise on the selection of speakers, programming content, and professional and business-building opportunities for program participants. In addition, together we'll create a grant for a select group of Latinx creators and music artists, helping to further their content creator careers.\"Building on the success of our MACRO x TikTok for Black Creatives program, we are thrilled to again partner with TikTok to identify and develop the next generation of Latinx entertainers.

Beginning today until September 8, Latinx TikTok creators who meet the eligibility criteria are invited to apply for the program. Finalists will be named in September.“TikTok has been transformational for my work as a storyteller because, as a platform, it gives everybody the opportunity to present their story in the most genuine way they can to find an audience that resonates with it. It was that encouragement that also made me want to apply for the TikTok for Black Creatives Program. I think that what the program is doing in terms of empowering Black creators to tell their stories in a way that's meaningful but also helps them move towards their overall [career] goals, is something that's really powerful.” - Tony Weaver, Jr. (@tonyweaverjr)\"As a talent manager, one of my favorite things about TikTok is the ability to discover new creators on the app. In fact, because of the TikTok for Black Creatives program, I saw an amazing video from up-and-comer Kennedy Murray and immediately knew I wanted to sign her. Now, the biggest brands in the world are also big fans of @whokae and her innovative creativity.

Be it through viewing the latest book recommendations on #BookTok or showing off their new digs on #renovation, everyone can find their community on TikTok – and our goal is to foster a safe and welcoming platform for these vibrant, diverse communities.On TikTok we offer a range of safety and privacy controls to empower people to make decisions about who they share their content with. We also believe it's important to ensure even stronger proactive protections to help keep teens safe, and we've continually introduced changes to support age-appropriate experiences on our platform. This includes making accounts belonging to those under the age of 16 private by default, reserving features like Direct Messaging to people 16 and older, and enabling parents to guide their teen's TikTok presence with Family Pairing.Today we're introducing a new set of changes for teens aged 13-17 to further enhance these proactive protections. These changes will continue rolling out to our community globally over the coming months.New changes to Direct Messaging privacy settingsWe want to help teens make active decisions about their privacy settings, so when someone aged 16-17 joins TikTok, their Direct Messaging setting will now be set to 'No One' by default. To message others, they will need to actively switch to a different sharing option. Existing accounts that have never used DMs before will receive a prompt asking them to review and confirm their privacy settings the next time they use this feature. These updates build on our current messaging protections, such as not allowing images or videos to be sent in messages and disabling messaging for accounts under age 16.Decide who can watch your videosThe process of making a TikTok is fun and creative – choosing music, picking effects, and getting the transitions right – but it is just as important to choose who that video will be shared with. To help teens understand the sharing options available to them we're now adding a pop-up that appears when teens under the age of 16 are ready to publish their first video, asking them to choose who can watch the video. They won't be able to publish their video until they make a selection.With each video going forward, creators can decide who can watch before they post. Accounts aged 13-15 are set to private by default, and private accounts can choose to share their content with Followers or Friends, as the 'Everyone' setting is turned off. Duet and Stitch are also disabled for accounts under 16.Choose who can download your public videosWe're also providing additional context to help teens aged 16-17 understand how downloads work, so they can choose the option that's most comfortable for them. If they opt to turn the feature on, they'll now receive a pop-up asking them to confirm that choice before others can download their videos. Note that downloads are permanently disabled on content from accounts under the age of 16.A mindful approach to push notificationsTikTok prioritizes and supports the well-being of our community members, with features like Screen Time Management that can be enabled both by account holders or by parents as part of Family Pairing. We want to help our younger teens in particular develop positive digital habits early on, and we regularly consult with leading paediatric experts and youth well-being advocates to develop our Youth Portal, bullying prevention guide, and other features that support youth-well being. Now, we'll be drawing upon this research to make changes that reduce the time period during which our younger teens can receive push notifications. Accounts aged 13-15 will not receive push notifications from 9pm, and accounts aged 16-17 will have push notifications disabled starting at 10pm.These changes continue to build on our ongoing commitments as there's no finish line when it comes to protecting the safety, privacy, and well-being of our community. We're working with teens, community organizations, parents, and creators to further innovate and we're excited to share more over the coming months.

Also cartoons…which I still watch to this day!What was your reaction to seeing so much success on the platform?I'm grateful and happy about it, but I always remain down-to-earth and true to my original idea of making videos to have fun and make others laugh. I consider myself a simple guy.What are some content creation tips you would offer other creators?I think it's enough that you really like what you do and love who you are and how you show yourself to others. And then the rest will come accordingly.What is your favorite feature to create videos with?I love creating videos using TikTok's Stitch feature, but also creating them from scratch.What video have you created that you can't stop thinking about?So many! Definitely the one of the rearview mirror or the handbrake. But also the one made with Alessandro del Piero with an apple.

Those experiences have shaped much of the way we're entertained today, and with TikTok LIVE, we want to give people the tools to bring that same level of connection to a worldwide audience. TikTok LIVE brought together a global community to experience an innovative concert experience with The Weeknd, embark on an around-the-world museum tour to explore art and culture, and much more. And we're empowering creators with unique and innovative tools that inspire content creation, foster connections with audiences, and encourage exploration. Livestreaming has become an integral way for creators and viewers to connect authentically, and over the past year, the number of people going LIVE and watching LIVE has doubled. The excitement and engagement from the TikTok community is why we continue to invest in new features to aid in safely discovering, creating, and consuming LIVE videos.LIVE EventsRecently launched in select markets, LIVE Events is a new tool that lets creators schedule, manage, and promote LIVE videos. While viewers can easily discover, register, get notifications, and receive a reminder when the LIVE is about to start, LIVE Events is a great way for creators and fans to easily connect ahead of an upcoming LIVE stream. From musicians and artists to non-profits and museums, the possibilities for LIVE Events are endless.Picture-in-PictureYou won't want to miss any of the excitement from a real-time LIVE stream – but what happens if you are in the middle of watching a Q&A or performance and the group chat is blowing up? Instead of missing a second of the stream, TikTok users can seamlessly continue watching LIVE videos across their device with Picture-in-Picture on iOS and Android.Go LIVE TogetherThe world is full of dynamic duos: Charli and Dixie, Gayle and Oprah, Beyonce and Jay Z – the list goes on – and your next favorite duo might come from a LIVE video. Go LIVE Together gives people the ability to easily go LIVE through Go LIVE Together. This means more chances for LOL inducing interactions, twice as many behind the scenes reveals, and more ways to connect with top creators.LIVE Q&AWith LIVE Q&A hosts are able to easily engage with and respond to viewer's questions in realtime. The LIVE Q&A suite of tools helps hosts more easily select, showcase, and answer questions from fans while LIVE. This leads to more entertaining experiences and deeper connections for everyone tuned in to the stream.Top LIVEsDiscovery is at the heart of the TikTok experience. Rolling out soon, people will be able to more easily find and tune into LIVE videos conveniently from the For You and Following pages. Some of the top LIVE categories include Chat (Q&A), Gaming, Talents, Fashion, and Daily Life, and with updated access points to the LIVE page, Top and Recommended LIVE videos will soon be closer than ever.Help for HostsTo help hosts focus on entertaining and engaging the community, they can now, ahead of their livestream, assign a person they trust to help them manage their streams by tapping Settings on the right side of the livestream launch screen. During the LIVE, both the host and the person helping can mute and block users to help keep the stream welcoming and civil.Keyword FiltersAs LIVE provides creators the opportunity to share more of themselves with the TikTok community, our goal is to help people feel comfortable doing so, which means taking a hard stance against bullying or hateful comments. We're mindful that some comments or words may seem innocuous to some but are hurtful to others. To protect against this, in the settings tab of the LIVE launch screen, hosts can turn off comments or add up to 200 terms into the keyword filter to limit those comments in the chat. Words can be added to the list throughout the livestream by hosts and the person helping them.Consider Before You CommentOnce a livestream starts, we want creators to be able to focus on entertaining their viewers. Because negative or abusive comments undermine the passion and energy creators put into their livestreams, viewers will now be prompted to reconsider the impact of their words before posting a potentially unkind or harmful comment.In the coming weeks, we'll also introduce a way for hosts and the person helping manage their LIVE to temporarily mute viewers or remove unkind or harmful comments as we strive to maintain a supportive and authentic community environment. This is also why we have additional safeguards and policies for LIVE, including requiring accounts to be 16 or older to host a livestream. We also prohibit gift-baiting (the solicitation of gifts or engagement) as well as fraudulent behavior or scams. Further, if we identify an account that impersonates or misleads our community about their identity, we will remove the account from our platform.We're committed to maintaining the joyful, supportive, and inspiring community that exists on TikTok while building new relationships with more creators, artists, brands, and viewers through products like TikTok LIVE. Whether on the FYF, scrolling through the Discover Page, or watching a TikTok LIVE, we're excited about the possibilities of expanding TikTok from a platform to an ecosystem at the center of entertainment, the creator economy, and technology."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-herecomestheboy","date":"2021-07-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: #HereComesTheBoy","text":"TikTok creators show off their furry friends with the #HereComesTheBoy trend.

To maintain that environment, we develop tools and technology to empower creators and counter violations of our Community Guidelines.Over the last year in different markets we've been trialing and adjusting new systems that identify and remove violative content and notify people of their violations. Today we're bringing these systems to the US and Canada as we work to advance the safety of our community and integrity of our platform.Evolving content moderation on TikTokOur US-based Safety team is responsible for developing and enforcing the policies and safety strategies aimed at keeping people across the US and Canada safe. Like most user-generated content platforms, content uploaded to TikTok initially passes through technology that works to identify and flag potential policy violations for further review by a safety team member. If a violation is confirmed, the video will be removed and the creator will be notified of the removal and reason and given the opportunity to appeal the removal. If no violation is identified, the video will be posted and others on TikTok will be able to view it.Over the next few weeks, we'll begin using technology to automatically remove some types of violative content identified upon upload, in addition to removals confirmed by our Safety team. Automation will be reserved for content categories where our technology has the highest degree of accuracy, starting with violations of our policies on minor safety, adult nudity and sexual activities, violent and graphic content, and illegal activities and regulated goods. While no technology can be completely accurate in moderating content, where decisions often require a high degree of context or nuance, we'll keep improving the precision of our technology to minimize incorrect removals. Creators will be able to appeal their video's removal directly in our app or report potential violations to us for review, as they can today.In addition to improving the overall experience on TikTok, we hope this update also supports resiliency within our Safety team by reducing the volume of distressing videos moderators view and enabling them to spend more time in highly contextual and nuanced areas, such as bullying and harassment, misinformation, and hateful behavior. Our Safety team will continue to review reports from our community, content flagged by technology, or appeals, and remove violations. Note that mass reporting content or accounts does not lead to an automatic removal or to a greater likelihood of removal by our Safety team.As we've detailed in our Transparency Reports, this technology initially launched in places where additional safety support was needed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, we've found that the false positive rate for automated removals is 5% and requests to appeal a video's removal have remained consistent. We hope to continue improving our accuracy over time.Helping people understand our Community GuidelinesWe've also evolved the way we notify people of the Community Guidelines violations they receive to bring more visibility to our policies and reduce repeat violations. The new system counts the violations accrued by a user and is based on the severity and frequency of the violation(s). People will be notified of the consequence(s) of their violation(s), starting in the Account Updates section of their Inbox. There, they can also see a record of their accrued violations.More frequent violations will accrue more penalties and notifications in different parts of our app.Here’s how it works:First violationSend a warning in the app, unless the violation is a zero-tolerance policy, which will result in an automatic ban.After the first violationSuspend an account's ability to upload a video, comment, or edit their profile for 24 or 48 hours, depending on the severity of the violation and previous violations.Or, restrict an account to a view-only experience for 72 hours or up to one week, meaning the account can’t post or engage with content.Or, after several violations, a user will be notified if their account is on the verge of being banned. If the behavior persists, the account will be permanently removed.Our zero-tolerance policies, such as posting child sexual abuse material, automatically result in an account's removal. We may also block a device to help prevent future accounts from being created.While we strive to be consistent, neither technology nor humans will get moderation decisions correct 100% of the time, which is why it's important that creators can continue to appeal their content's or account's removal directly in our app. If their content or account has been incorrectly removed, it will be reinstated, the penalty will be erased, and it will not impact the account going forward. Accrued violations will expire from a person's record over time.We developed these systems with input from our US Content Advisory Council, and in testing them in the US and Canada over the last few weeks, over 60% of people who received a first warning for violating our guidelines did not have a second violation. The more transparent and accessible our policies are, the less people violate them, and the more people can create and be entertained on TikTok.People spend substantial time and energy creating content for TikTok, and it's critical to us that our systems for moderating content be accurate and consistent. We want to hear from our community about their experiences so that we can continue to make improvements as we work to keep the platform safe and inclusive for our global community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-beyond-buffering","date":"2021-07-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: Beyond #buffering","text":"TikTok creators break out reactions with the #buffering trend.

Short, creative videos, combined with TikTok's easy-to-use, built-in creation tools have organically created new ways to discover talented candidates and career opportunities.We're excited to launch \"TikTok Resumes\" as a pilot program designed to continue expanding and enhancing TikTok as a new channel for recruitment and job discovery. We're teaming up with select companies and inviting job seekers to apply for entry-level to experienced positions with some of the world's most sought-after employers, including Chipotle, Target, WWE, Alo Yoga, Shopify, Contra, Movers+Shakers, and many more, with a TikTok video resume.

Like many, college students were impacted by the pandemic and have displayed a resilience and unwavering optimism that’s truly been inspiring. We’re excited to help students and job seekers everywhere unleash their creativity and ‘get the bag!’” TikTok Resumes can be found in the app through #TikTokResumes and at www.tiktokresumes.com.

As a result, today, we're proud to announce our commitment to address two priorities women have said are critical for their online safety: improved reporting systems and more control over their online experiences.Over the coming months, we'll begin to develop and test a number of potential product changes to our platform that address these priorities and help make TikTok an ever safer place for women.Keeping our community safeAt TikTok, we work round the clock to help ensure our platform is a safe, positive space for self-expression. Our platform thrives on the diversity of our community, and we believe that safety is a prerequisite for creativity. Everything we do is about fostering an environment where people feel welcomed, empowered, and safe to express themselves exactly as they are.Our online safety strategy has multiple aspects. We enforce our Community Guidelines using both technology and thousands of safety professionals around the world. We develop pioneering safety policies and features, and we partner with external safety experts to keep abreast of complex and constantly evolving challenges.While we continue to invest in cutting-edge technologies and industry-leading safety teams, we also work to ensure our community feels in control of their TikTok experience. Here are just a few examples on how to stay safe on TikTok:In control of comments: Our community can restrict who comments on their videos to no one, just friends or everyone (for those aged under 16, we don't offer the Everyone setting). Users can choose to filter all comments, so they can decide which comments will appear on their videos. When enabled, comments aren't displayed unless the video's creator approves them using the new comment management tool. People can also choose to filter comments containing specific keywords they have selected. Multiple comments can be deleted or reported at once, and accounts that post bullying or other negative comments can be blocked in bulk, too, up to 100 at a time. By default, spam and offensive comments are hidden from users when we detect them.Promote kindness: A prompt asks people to reconsider the impact of their words before posting a comment that may be inappropriate or unkind and reminds users to review our Community Guidelines.Report inappropriate content and behavior: Reporting is fast, easy and confidential on TikTok. If a user sees something - whether it's a video, a comment, a direct message or an account - they don't think should be on TikTok, they can use the in-app reporting button to let us know. We will review against our Community Guidelines and take appropriate action.In addition to investing in technology to keep our community safe, we work to provide resources to our community on important issues like sexual assault. During Sexual Assault Awareness Month we partnered with the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) to support the important conversations occurring on the platform about sexual violence and connect our community with permanent resources and educational content within the app. Our goal at TikTok is to foster an inclusive space for everyone, including survivors.We look forward to sharing more on our progress to deliver on our commitment to improve online safety for women in the coming months. In the meantime, you can find out more about how to stay safe on TikTok at our Safety Center."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-were-on-vacation","date":"2021-06-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: We're on vacation","text":"TikTok creators return to exploring as summer continues.

It's how we connect with our communities. It's how we entertain, educate, inform, and inspire each other. This is also why we've focused on providing our community with a range of tools to help unleash their creativity – longer videos are now one more tool people can use to captivate the community with their creative expression.Some of you might have come across a longer video on TikTok already – we’ve been letting creators around the world experiment with the expanded format. Creators are already well-versed in weaving multi-part stories together on TikTok (we all know the phrase, \"like and follow for part 3”) but we often hear from creators that they'd love just a little more time to bring their cooking demos, elaborate beauty tutorials, educational lesson plans, and comedic sketches to life with TikTok’s creative tools. With longer videos, creators will have the canvas to create new or expanded types of content on TikTok, with the flexibility of a bit more space.Over the coming weeks, we’ll be rolling out the option to create longer videos to everyone on TikTok, giving our global community the flexibility to film, upload, and edit videos up to three minutes in length directly within TikTok.

To maintain the trust of our community, we aim to be transparent about the actions we take surrounding their content. With that in mind, today we're releasing our global Q1 Community Guidelines Enforcement Report as we continue to bring transparency to the critical work of moderating content in order to keep TikTok a safe and welcoming place for our community.Since 2019 we've released Transparency Reports, increasing the information we provide with each report. This includes adding insights related to the actions we take to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, such as reporting the nature of content removed for violating our policies and the number of violative ads rejected. We've heard from our community, civil society organizations, and policymakers that this information is helpful to understanding how TikTok operates and moderates content. To share these insights more frequently, we're now publishing quarterly Community Guidelines Enforcement Reports as part of our broader transparency reporting efforts. Because of the nature of processing and responding to legal requests, we'll continue to publish those data bi-annually.Here are some of the key insights from our Q1 2021 report, which you can read in full here.61,951,327 videos were removed for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, which is less than 1% of all videos uploaded on TikTok.82% of these videos were removed before they received any views, 91% before any user reports, and 93% within 24 hours of being posted.1,921,900 ads were rejected for violating advertising policies and guidelines.11,149,514 accounts were removed for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, of which 7,263,952 were removed from the full TikTok experience for potentially belonging to a person under the age of 13. This is less than 1% of all accounts on TikTok.71,470,161 accounts were blocked from being created through automated means.As we’ve evolved our report, we’ve aimed to help the industry push forward when it comes to transparency and accountability around user safety. To bring more visibility to the actions we take to protect minors, in this report we added the number of accounts removed from the full TikTok experience for potentially belonging to an underage person. This builds upon our previous work to strengthen our default privacy settings for teens, offer tools to empower parents and families, and limit features like direct messaging and livestream to those age 16 and over. As we look ahead, we aim to explore new technologies to help with the industry-wide challenge of age assurance in order to help route people into the age-appropriate TikTok experience.This report also included our first security overview on our global bug bounty program which helps us proactively identify and resolve security vulnerabilities. This program strengthens our overall security maturity by encouraging global security researchers to identify and responsibly disclose bugs to our teams so we can resolve them before attackers exploit them. As we report, in the first quarter of 2021, TikTok received 33 valid submissions and resolved 29 of them. We also received and published 8 public disclosure requests. With regards to response efficiency, TikTok has an average first response time of 8 hours, resolution time of 30 days, and it takes us 3 days on average to pay out a bounty.In the future, we'll publish this data at our online transparency center which we're working to overhaul to be a home for our transparency reporting and other information about our efforts to protect the safety and integrity of our platform."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-family-spotlight-parentinghack-terrellandjarius-allisonholkerboss","date":"2021-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok Family Spotlight: #parentinghack, @terrell_jarius, and @allisonholkerboss","text":"TikTok transcends generations and empowers everyone, from Gen Z to grandparents, to come together and express their creativity through short videos.As more and more families create and find community on TikTok, we’re highlighting our favorite #parentinghack videos, as well as putting a spotlight on LGBTQ+ TikTok Trailblazers, Terrell and Jarius (@terrell_jarius), two dads who beautifully share their experience raising kids.

The TikTok UEFA EURO 2020 show was staged at Portman Road, home stadium of Ed's beloved Ipswich Town football club and streamed globally on his TikTok channel.The groundbreaking performance was conceived and filmed specifically for the TikTok audience. From a bespoke stage designed and created to be native to vertical video, the show combined groundbreaking special effects, an on-stage mobile phone that Ed used to talk directly to the audience, as well as augmented reality that changed with each song and integrated with the backdrop of the football stadium. It was a performance that encapsulated both intimacy and scale, creating a unique moment that wowed millions in the TikTok community. Acclaimed British Music Video Director Emil Nava and Music and Television Director Hamish Hamilton worked in partnership with TikTok, Atlantic Records, Ed's management and the artist himself to produce the creative and technical spectacle, which also featured prominent TikTok creators Jeremy Lynch, Nathan Ramsay and Leticia Stock.The show also included the live premiere of his new single 'Bad Habits', following an exclusive preview on TikTok the week before, which let fans create videos using a clip of the song.

How has that meaning changed for you over time?When I think of what being proud, or having Pride means, I consider it outside of the general definitions as related to sexuality and gender. Pride means not fading into the background, not shrinking myself or dimming my light in order to make myself more palatable. Pride means being fully myself, sharing myself, and supporting my community in any way I can. Pride means speaking up against injustice in all forms, and not letting that be the only thing we do, but using it as a foundation for action. It's more than just rainbows and parades, it's living our daily lives as full human beings who love, and are loved, who feel pain and sorrow. And finally, it's about leaning into a community that can become your family, without losing sight of its own downsides, and using your voice to contribute to its growth.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?I was raised in a Chassidic Jewish home. When I ended up in foster care, I knew nothing about the world. It was culture shock. Like a storm swept me away and I landed on a planet that looked the same, but everything was completely different. I lost my community, and for a long time, my family. Coming out just a few months after entering the system was something I had never expected. But when I did, I joined a community that taught me who I was. How to flourish. And they had my back. Complete strangers became loved ones, supporting me from a distance and casting a net that I never wanted to count on but was there for me when I needed it. Starting a business that was built on supporting this very community was a no brainer. I wanted to use my knowledge and experience to empower my community to better understand their vehicles, save money, and ultimately, help ease some of that fear that people can feel when taking their car into the repair shop.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?By lifting up and amplifying the voices of those most marginalized and putting my money where my mouth is.How has the TikTok community inspired you?Before TikTok, video content wasn't really my jam. But when I started creating, the community took to my work in such a loud and loving way that I quickly grew comfortable. Now creating video content is my primary way of sharing information on social media, allowing me to connect with people in a way I never had the opportunity to before. Every time I scroll down my For You Page, I learn new things, find new people who inspire me, and rededicate myself to my own personal mission of educating and empowering women and queer folks around cars.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?The fight isn't over. Marriage isn't the culmination of LGBT equality. There is more work to be done.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?Being an ally implies someone takes action on behalf of a person or a group. Being an ally to the LGBT community comes in the form of learning, changing your language, and speaking up in uncomfortable moments.Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following?@rynnstar, @seansvv and @mercurystardust"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-rjchumbley","date":"2021-06-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @rjchumbley","text":"As we celebrate Pride 2021, we’re sharing the inspiring stories from our LGBTQ+ TikTok Trailblazers on our Creator Spotlight Series, who are advocating for their communities both on and off TikTok.

They are always pushing the boundaries of masculinity and femininity, creating a community where everyone can be \"goddess babes.”What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?Visibility, community, understanding and acceptance. Pride when one first discovers who they are, at its simplest definition, means being proud to be who you are. As time goes on, it means being proud to be a part of a beautiful community and ultimately, one huge family.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?As we are both feminine and masculine and use he/they pronouns, our identity allows us to be authentic to ourselves and to open our eyes to a much fuller and beautiful range of human identity. Allowing us the freedom to explore and truly understand our gender identities, and sexuality; as they are not synonymous with one another. The confines of the heteronormative structure are blown away, and we are simply allowed to be free, allowed to be our most authentic selves, and accept the people around us for who they are.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?By uplifting and supporting other queer creators across all social platforms and using our platform to be an advocate for and amplify the many diverse voices within our community.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The endless amount of creativity on TikTok is astounding and truly inspiring. So many diverse groups of people all showcasing their individual talents and experiences, making the world a more beautiful and educated community.What video are you most proud of creating?This one! It's actually the fourth video posted on Adrian's channel, @beingadp.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?Just be your real self. There are so many people who will boost you up and share the love with you. If you get into the right community, people will find you. Try it, do it and get out there. Find your niche, come up with something original, and have fun with it. Practice, but dont take it too seriously. Get inspired by others -- there is a community for everything youre interested in.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?Surround yourself with those who allow you to thrive and grow into your own identity. Do not let the boundaries of other peoples' minds hold you back from loving and accepting yourself.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?Educating themselves about the many diverse identities that the queer community includes. Doing their own research on the many laws within and outside the country that are discriminitory against the queer community, and spread awareness. Do not be afraid to have those \"hard\" conversations with those around you, be they family, coworkers or friends.

I've been here since your first video, and that makes me wanna start since you improved soo fast.\"If you had to sketch or illustrate kindness, what would it look like?I'd have to animate, not illustrate it. And it would be something along the lines of showing how doing something good for/to someone can pass on.Which TikTok creators do you admire or inspire you?All of the animators are very inspiring, like all of @tiktoons. As well as the animators who do special effects and cinema. I also enjoy the comedy side like my friend @Strawhatdan. There's too many to say specific names because I'd feel bad if I missed any.What do you think makes the TikTok community so special?I think TikTok is special because it's the new \"underdog,\" and the community can drive big changes in the real world.Why do you think people bully or try to hurt one another, especially online?Maybe online bullying occurs because it's easy to hide behind a username.What do you think can people can do in their own way to make the internet a kinder, more inclusive place?Make the community feel that bullying is just not cool and doesn't look good. As well as everything TikTok is already doing to make it better.You can find King Science's video for the #CreateKindness campaign below, all month within our Discover page as well as permanently on @TikTokTips.

We are driven by a passion to provide a welcoming space for people around the world, where they feel comfortable expressing themselves and being there for each other. This has inspired us to launch #CreateKindness, a global safety campaign and creative video series, as we continue to encourage everyone to choose kindness in their everyday lives.This month we are also spotlighting the six creator-animators we partnered with to help bring the campaign to life. These talented creators wrote, animated, and lent their voices to their videos, which infuse their distinctive style with their personal experiences with online bullying.Today, we recognize Rosie Maharjan (@rosie.gif), who describes herself as \"a product designer by trade and illustration artist by heart.\" This self-taught artist uses illustration to illuminate her personal experiences and amplify underrepresented voices, and thereby give a voice to those who wouldn't otherwise have one.How would you describe your art style?Pop Art minimalismHow has the TikTok community inspired your art? What makes you continue to create and share your art on TikTok?I love scrolling through my FYP and seeing the outcome of so many hours of hard work condensed into 60 seconds. The art community is so talented and supportive, and I always feel very inspired by its creativity. It encourages me to post my own work, explore new styles, and try new forms of art I never would've thought of (i.e. rug making TikTok??)What's the kindest comment (about your art) you've received on TikTok?\"This is so inspiring!\" I love the idea that my work could invoke that same inspiration that I get from artists that I admire.If you had to illustrate kindness, what would that look like?Watering a plant 🌱 because one small act of kindness is all it takes to help someone feel loved and grow.Why do you think people bully or try to hurt one another, especially online?Being online is a veil; so, it's a lot easier to be insensitive if you can't see the immediate impact of your words and actions. Especially online, when thousands of other people are doing the same thing — you can easily fall into the masses of mob mentality.What do you think can people can do in their own way to make the internet a kinder, more inclusive place?Empathizing with each other! It takes a lot of emotional maturity to admit you might have hurt someone — even if it wasn't intentional. But the internet could be a much more inclusive place if we all take a step back and try to understand where someone might be coming from.What do you want people to take away from your video?There is not one big bully who altered my life, but rather, a collection of insidious comments that — whether intentional or not — devalued me and my identity. I wanted to visually represent what it’s like to internalize comments that are too small to be deemed offensive, but big enough to hurt and remind you that you don’t belong. I hope this animation gives anyone who’s ever felt that way permission to process those feelings, and brings awareness to those who may not realize how harmful their words might be.You can find Rosie's video for the #CreateKindness campaign below, all month within our Discover page as well as permanently on @TikTokTips.

The next LGBTQ+ TikTok Trailblazer on our Creator Spotlight Series is emblematic of a generation that embraces exactly who they are. Meet @kennethpabon, a creator who is strong in his beliefs and confident in his style. His videos will make you laugh, all while giving you the tools to be an icon yourself.Read more below about what Pride means to Kenneth, and how his journey to self-acceptance has inspired his content.What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?Growing up, I was riddled with anxiety during Pride month. For a long time, it was an overwhelming reminder that I had a secret and that I was not living authentically. Now, after being out for several years, it is my favourite time of the year. It is a time where I reflect on my personal growth, relationships and community. It is a time where I embrace and celebrate all aspects of what makes me me. I want to remind you all that we need to come to terms with our identity on our own timelines, and that's okay! Celebrate who you are and where you are in the meantime.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?When I began to embrace my own identity and sexuality, I became increasingly confident, specifically in experimenting with fashion. I can walk down the street (or my treadmill) in heels and a dress and feel just as comfortable as if I were to wear more typically masculine clothing. Understanding and accepting myself inspired me to empower others to do the same. Whether it is wearing what you feel best in or simply going against the norm, know that staying true to yourself is incredibly rewarding.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?Each day I choose to be me, the real authentic me. This was made possible by so many notable others that have come before me to stand up for LGBTQ+ rights. I am so thankful to those who fought to be themselves, so that I can be myself. The best way to celebrate is to always be authentically true to myself, and guide others to do the same.How has the TikTok community inspired you?When I began using TikTok, I had no intention of doing it full time. It was a creative space and a much needed outlet for me during the pandemic. To my surprise, I found an entire community of accepting and relatable content and creators that I felt welcomed into during a time that was so isolating. It inspired me to do the same for others and create videos that remind you it is OK to stand out and the opinions of others should never stop you from living your truth.What video are you most proud of creating?One of my original \"how to be iconic\" videos with my mom. This was the moment where I found the most incredible audience of people who were looking for advice.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?First off, make suyre you do what makes you happy. Don't just go with the trends and instead, create what resonates with you and people will follow. Post as much as possible -- you never know what's going to land. Make it fun, it shows through the app when you're having fun.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?Be fearless. Don’t put weight on judgment from others. I promise it will pay off!How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?By normalizing everyone’s sexuality within the LGBTQ+ community. It should not be something to be afraid of, but instead embraced. My family and I always show that on my TikTok -- I believe my family’s radical acceptance of me is a crucial part of my personal growth and acceptance.Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching (and why)?My favs (in no particular order):@selyna.brillare will make you laugh at any given moment. Lewks, confidence, and laughs are always being radiated from this icon. My go to for when I’m feeling down!@charlesgross, for all fashion and lifestyle content. Such a well-spoken creator who makes me feel more intelligent just by watching. He also has amazing storytimes about his high fashion lifestyle!@aarontichenor, for the most out of pocket funny laughs. His sense of humor is so different yet so easy to watch. He creates a sense of acceptance without even talking about it, not to mention his ICONIC outfits that he wears everywhere. It’s truly inspiring."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/one-year-later-our-commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion","date":"2021-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"One year later: Our commitment to diversity and inclusion","text":"Last summer, we witnessed a powerful awakening across our country led by the Black Lives Matter movement. On TikTok, the emotional voices, images, and stories were an important reminder of the responsibility we have to our community. As we shared in our progress report last June, racism and discrimination have no place on TikTok and we're committed to specific, concrete actions in our push to build an inclusive platform reflective of our diverse world.We believe that the diversity of our community is a huge part of what makes TikTok a rewarding and inspiring place to spend time, and we’re driven to actively promote and protect it every day. Over the past year, our teams have continued working to elevate and support Black voices and causes, while fostering an inclusive environment on our platform and within our workplace.Empowering our creatorsCreators are the heart of TikTok, and as part of our commitment to recognizing and uplifting their voices we introduced our Creator Diversity Collective – a braintrust of talented, passionate creators from different backgrounds who've helped us create and shape programs that spotlight and amplify diverse creators. In collaboration with this group, we rolled out community-favorite TikTok LIVE programs including Dinner with Me, Amplifying Diverse Voices, and more, that highlight the diverse stories and experiences on TikTok.We hosted our first TikTok for Black Creatives creator accelerator program, where 100 talented, emerging Black creators and music artists participated in educational events, community-building forums, and motivational town halls to further grow and develop their creator careers. Additionally, we launched the TikTok Creator Portal as a resource hub for the already flourishing Black creative community on TikTok and created @BlackTikTok, the official home of the #BlackTikTok community.Supporting our creators and local communitiesWe also launched our inaugural Black TikTok Trailblazers list and began an ongoing creator spotlight series that features creators from diverse backgrounds and identities. TikTok would not be what it is today without the contributions of Black creators and we're committed to honoring and celebrating this community, today and every day.We introduced Support Black Businesses, an online hub where Black entrepreneurs can learn about TikTok's ongoing partnerships and initiatives that drive awareness, support, and patronage of their businesses. This hub builds upon our broader efforts to promote inclusivity in entrepreneurship, including a $500,000 donation to the Accion Opportunity Fund last summer to provide relief to Black small business owners impacted by COVID-19.And we provided financial support to non-profit organizations that fight for racial equality and justice and provide programs and resources to local Black communities, including BET + United Way COVID-19 Relief Fund, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Center for Policing Equity, Black Girls CODE, Brooklyn Community Foundation, Chicago-based My Block My Hood My City, and The Brotherhood Crusade. We also made contributions to Black museums across the country that are working to preserve Black stories and history, as well as academic institutions that serve underrepresented students with programs focused on public health and professions in the medical and healthcare fields, including historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).Building more tools for our communityOver the past year, we've rolled out a number of tools to empower our community. In response to creator feedback, we launched an improved notification system and appeals process to create more transparency and understanding for our community. We've also made it easier for creators to control comments on their content so they can better shape their online experience. Creators can now delete or report comments or block users in bulk instead of one by one. We've also provided an option to filter all comments and we're prompting users to reconsider posting unkind comments to foster kindness on TikTok.In addition to leveraging technology, we're always working to evolve our policies so that they are fair and equitable. One of the changes we made for example, was to incorporate the evolution of expression into our policies and train our enforcement teams to better understand more nuanced content like cultural appropriation and slurs. If a member of a disenfranchised group, such as the Black community, uses a word as a term of empowerment, we want our enforcement teams to understand the context behind it and not mistakenly take the content down. On the other hand, if a slur is being used hatefully, it doesn't belong on TikTok. Educating our enforcement teams on these crucial distinctions is ongoing work, and we strive to get this right for our community.We also continue to work with our Content Advisory Council, a group of independent online safety experts who are experts in a wide range of issue areas including race, hate speech, bullying and harassment, and misinformation. These experts help inform the work we do in regards to the technology we build and the policies we enact for our diverse community of users. We're also investing in unconscious bias training for our moderation team and the training includes education to better support underrepresented groups.Engaging our workforceInternally, our employees are blazing trails and advancing the efforts of our Diversity & Inclusion Council. In March, we hosted the first week-long TikTok Inclusion Summit to engage employees around three key pillars: Learn, Live, and Lead. The event featured a number of sessions, shedding light on how leaders can foster diversity and inclusion both on our platform and in our organization. We were also proud to launch BLXCK (Black X) as one of the first official Employee Resource Groups (ERG) to connect and support the advancement of Black talent at TikTok. BLXCK recently led efforts for TikTok to join Talent x Opportunity (TxO), an accelerator program led by Andreessen Horowitz. TxO entrepreneurs will also join TikTok's second Support Black Business cohort.In recognition of Juneteenth, we again closed all US offices and encouraged employees to use the day to reflect on how far we've come as a country, how much further we still have to go, and how we all as individuals can make a difference in the world.We take great pride and responsibility in knowing that we provide people of all races, ethnicities, cultures, disabilities, genders, and identities a platform to be seen and heard, but we know there's still much more work to done. We're humbled and grateful for the opportunity to continually improve ourselves as a platform, community, and organization."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/glimpse-inside-the-mind-of-in-the-heights-star-anthony-ramos-on-tiktoks-next-headstream","date":"2021-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Glimpse inside the mind of 'In The Heights' star Anthony Ramos on TikTok's Next Headstream","text":"Anthony Ramos, Artist and Actor whose new album Love and Lies is out June 25th alongside, starring in the blockbuster summer film In The Heights will be the next guest on TikTok’s Headstream, the app’s new interactive LIVE series that invites fans to enter the minds of their favorite artists the day they drop new music.

Get to know more about who they are, below, and learn more about what Pride means to them.What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?Pride to us means being your 100% unapologetic self, and living without fear of people judging you or not liking you because of who you are! Our “pride” strengthens each year as we look back at our younger days and realize how far we have come in owning our true identities.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?Being gay twins who are also drag queens, our identity has allowed us to be fearless, live our truth, and not take life seriously while doing so. If we can dress up as crazy bimbos and run around our small town, then you can be whoever you want to be as well!How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?We celebrate by putting ourselves out there to represent people like us and hopefully inspire others to do the same.How has the TikTok community inspired you?It has shown us the power of representation and how important it is to find your “tribe” and have a sense of community on the internet. Seeing other people with shared life experiences is so empowering.What video are you most proud of creating?We would have to say the video where we addressed what our pronouns are. We think we got our message across about the LGBTQ community in a really fun, hilarious way that resulted in a viral video with over 11 million views. We love educating people without them even realizing it. We always say “come for the looks and stay for the crazy!” Plus we’re obsessed with our Spice Girl inspired outfits in the video of course!What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?Standing out and doing what is truly authentic to you! Sounds basic, but that’s what worked for us at least. Trends are great but we didn’t start taking off on TikTok until we started to produce original content and not follow what every other creator was doing. People really enjoy watching others have fun and being in their full element, so don’t put the pressure on yourself to make a “viral” video. We always think to ourselves: would we still enjoy making this video if no one else saw it but us? That’s how we try to look at it! Another tip: just post your video and go! Don’t over think it. There’s an audience out there for everyone, so don’t be afraid and go for it!What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?That your sexual identity/gender doesn’t define you, it’s something to be proud of! Now go out there and get the haters mad by being the shining star that you are.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?By supporting and boosting their favorite LGBTQ creators! And staying open minded to learning about people that aren’t like them.Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching (and why)?The Coyle Twins duhhh! Haha but seriously we love Chrissy Chlapecka, not only is she hilarious and sweet, but she has an amazing message of empowering women and not conforming to society's rules and labels."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/join-us-at-the-first-ever-global-tiktok-pride-finale","date":"2021-06-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Join Us at the First-Ever Global TikTok Pride Finale","text":"Earlier this month when we kicked off our Pride 2021 celebration, we put out a global rallying cry: Free to be.

Read more below about how Jere’s experiences have shaped her into a more empathetic person, and how she’s found support from the TikTok community during a difficult year.What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?Pride means celebrating my true self and feeling a sense of love for both myself and those in our community. Pride is also a sanctuary for me, as it provides a safe space for me to simply exist without feeling “different.”How has your identity influenced or shaped you?Growing up gay in a small Georgia town in the late 1980s/90s has given me an understanding of the hardships that many face. As a matter of fact, the only mention of the LGBTQ+ community I recall throughout my childhood was in high school health class. Students submitted anonymous questions, and I asked about homosexuality. My teacher responded, “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. This is disgusting. Next question.” This conservative background molded me into a more empathetic and non-judgmental adult. It has given me the desire to educate those who may lack the understanding of our community, and to be the openly gay teacher I never had.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?I strive to provide a classroom atmosphere that celebrates differences and create a safe space for all students to be their true selves. As an openly gay elementary teacher, people often turn to me for guidance and support.How has the TikTok community inspired you?Like many, 2020 was a difficult year for me and TikTok helped me through it. When I joined, I immediately felt as if I was a part of a community. Through the ups and downs, TikTok showed me real people sharing their lives.

I chose to create a page that centers on positive vibes through sharing my teaching and a two-mom family life.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?Before you concern yourself with others’ perceptions, love yourself, because you deserve it. Find a community that accepts you for you.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?Honor us even when we’re not around. When you see and/or hear homophobic/transphobic actions, take a stance. The best thing you can do to show your support is give us a voice, listen, and vote in such a way that values our existence.Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching (and why)?@therainbowteacher - fun loving teacher who is everything rainbow.@mrwilliamsprek - Hilarious PreK teacher who breaks gender norms for young students@classroomyogi - Kind and loving 3rd grade teacher@thenewmixx - Degendering fashion@sy.the.gender.rebel - Activist and educator for all things LGBTQ+"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-jump-enriching-the-tiktok-experience-with-new-integrations","date":"2021-06-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"TikTok Jump: Enriching the TikTok experience with new integrations","text":"By Sean Kim, Head of Product, TikTok USToday we're excited to introduce TikTok Jump, a new way for creators to share engaging and informative content on TikTok. Built by third-party providers, Jumps are mini-programs and services that creators can link to within their videos. Users around the world can click these links to explore recipes, take quizzes, discover useful learning tools and much more, creating more dynamic and practical experiences for our community.TikTok has become a destination both to be entertained and to learn; through TikTok Jump, we're creating that \"last mile\" of our community's discovery journey and helping to spark action and deeper interaction both on and off the platform. An expanded group of creators will now be able to use Jumps in their videos, and we'll continue to gradually roll out availability more broadly.TikTok Jump wouldn't be possible without the creativity and innovation of our early beta collaborators. Whisk, Breathwrk, Quizlet, StatMuse, and Tabelog have each created convenient and informative Jumps that have empowered our creators to share mouthwatering recipes, calming breathing exercises, Spanish and French vocab flashcards, interesting sports stats, and more. TikTok Jump will also be featuring Wikipedia content as part of the site’s principles of free use.“We are thrilled to be a leading partner in TikTok Jump,\" said Nick Holzherr, Head of Whisk. \"Since initiating a limited Beta earlier this year, TikTok and Whisk have helped alleviate a long-standing problem that recipe creators face: how to allow TikTok users to view and save full recipe content. Not only are TikTok creators using Whisk to add recipes previously published online; they're also sharing unique TikTok recipes that don't exist anywhere else.\"New providers including BuzzFeed, Jumprope, IRL, and WATCHA will also be launching their own Jumps in the coming weeks. From movie reviews to beauty tutorials, we're excited to be expanding TikTok Jump to new verticals and use cases, and we look forward to seeing how our creators leverage these new mini-programs in their content.As we take the next steps in the evolution of TikTok Jump, we’re now opening the program to new providers who can offer exciting experiences for our community. With HTML5 compatibility and minimal technical integration, Jumps are easy for providers to build and deploy. The use cases for TikTok Jumps are almost limitless, and we look forward to working with selected providers to build innovative Jumps that help fuel the instructive and entertaining content our community craves.Through TikTok Jump, we're excited to make the in-app experience more dynamic and engaging than ever. To learn more about TikTok Jump and start the application process to become a provider, go to www.tiktok.com/jump.Correction: While Wikipedia was selected as one of six initial content providers to feature through TikTok Jump, our blog post has been corrected to clarify that neither Wikipedia nor the Wikimedia Foundation - its nonprofit operator - collaborated or partnered with TikTok on the Jumps feature."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/createkindness-creator-spotlight-series-milkymichii","date":"2021-06-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"#CreateKindness Creator Spotlight Series: @milkymichii","text":"At TikTok, we embrace creativity and celebrate our diverse community. We are driven by a passion to provide a welcoming space for people around the world, where they feel comfortable expressing themselves and being there for each other. This has inspired us to launch #CreateKindness, a global safety campaign and creative video series, as we continue to encourage everyone to choose kindness in their everyday lives.This month we are also spotlighting the six creator-animators we partnered with to help bring the campaign to life. These talented creators wrote, animated, and lent their voices to their videos, which infuse their distinctive style with their personal experiences with online bullying.Meet Diana Maria (@milkymichii), a self taught artist who creates animations based on musical snippets. For Diana, music is a great part of the creative process when developing animations as well as the color pink, which you'll often find her wearing in her videos.How would you describe your art style?My art style is simple with attention to detail.What made you share your art with TikTok?At first I joined because of the fun of the memes found on the app. After using the app for a while, I found people like myself who enjoy making art and sharing it with people. With them I found I could also share my art and grow, and ever since then I've been posting whenever I had breaks from college.What's the kindest comment (about your art) you've received on TikTok?\"Your art makes me happy.\"If you had to sketch/illustrate kindness, what would it look like?It would look like a handshake. A handshake represents solidarity to me as well as kindness!Which TikTok creators do you admire or inspire you?@Tootymcnooty, @missriahanimates, @camtoonist, @milkrune, @zobeebop, @recokh, @abnormalchaos and so many more.What do you think makes TikTok's community so special?The fact that you can make friends with so many people.Why do you think people bully or try to hurt one another, especially online?Because of their insecurities. They like bringing others down to feel in control or superior to the other person. Jealousy can be a part of the reason why they bully others as well.What do you think can people can do in their own way to make the internet a kinder, more inclusive place?Be more open to positivity. Recognize what makes you want to hurt another person and work on yourself. That will make not only the internet but the world a kinder, more inclusive place to be in.What was your creative process for your video in the #CreateKindness campaign?For my creative process I took the idea that spoke to me the most, which was the constant harassment and targeting by another party. After I wrote the script, I sat down with my sketches, let the animation and music flow onto the empty canvas.You can find Diana's video for the #CreateKindness campaign below, all month within our Discover page as well as permanently on @TikTokTips.

These talented creators wrote, animated, and lent their voices to their videos, which infuse their distinctive style with their personal experiences with online bullying.Today, we're highlighting Amy Davies (@wowrightmeow), a UK-based creator whose videos' cool 1980s/1990's aesthetic, bold colors, and positive message make their channels one of TikTok's bright spots.How would you describe your art style?Expressive, vibrant, and playful, with a flare of '80s/'90s influence.How has the TikTok community inspired your art? What makes you continue to create and share your art on TikTok?There's such a massive variety of art/creative styles, it's hard to not be inspired! It's cool to see creators working with whatever they have, and are passionate about. Whether that's doodling on sticky notes... all the way to working in industry standard software. Everyone has a chance to be unique, and have room to play with ideas and styles.What's the kindest comment (about your art) you've received on TikTok? *Overall, most of my comments are incredibly supportive! I think some of the ones that particularly stand out are from people that mention they've been inspired by my creations to pursue their own artistic journeys. That's just so cool!If you had to sketch/illustrate kindness, what would it look like?Something surrounding individuals raising others up because they genuinely care. Being respectful, listening to each other, and being able to discuss any personal challenges and struggles without fear of mockery.I'd also want to include being kind and patient with yourself. Things like having a willingness to learn and listen to others, and be open to change. To feel confident in following a path you feel is right for you, but also know that you can try something out and realize it's not serving you or others, and feel empowered to move on, change, or say just \"no thanks.\"Which TikTok creators do you admire or inspire you?@ZoBeeBop has a huge variety of animated content, and also integrates it into filmed footage. They clearly have a lot of fun with what they make, and openly discuss how their skill came simply from practicing. @GhostHoney isn't an animator, but is probably my FAVORITE creator. He's completely unapologetically himself, and that's a vibe I can fully get behind. He's also effortlessly sharp and witty.What do you think makes the TikTok community so special?I think it's the accessibility and diversity. Being creative is for everyone, no matter who you are, or your experience level. I only began taking my creative endeavors more seriously when I was 18 years old. Had I not been inspired by other creatives, I wouldn't be where I am today! With platforms like this, you can start your creative journey at any point. You don't have to have any fancy software, all you need is your phone. There are creators making content from all levels of experience. I don't feel like there's a toxic competitive attitude because of the sheer diversity of styles and personalities of the creators themselves.Why do you think people bully or try to hurt one another, especially online?This is the age old answer, I know... but honestly, I think the main reason is insecurity. Probably stemming from a root feeling of fear.I think it can be harder to see when you're younger. As a kid I used to roll my eyes whenever adults would say that the bullies probably had bad influences outside of their control that led to them being this way. It's hard to see that when you're the one receiving the outbursts of rage or spitefulness. It doesn't excuse the behavior by any means, and any damaging/toxic behavior needs to be addressed. But they may not be as evil as it seems.For example, if someone you don't know made a comment mocking your art style/creation that was definitely NOT constructive feedback, if you can try to look at it from an outside perspective, you could determine a few things that may help you feel empowered to deal with it (or decide to block them).It's so easy to make an immediate and flustered response. I myself still feel that urge when someone comments something inflammatory, or just straight up misinformation... But whoever left that comment is most likely there JUST to get a heated response out of you. Nobody truly confident in themselves goes out of their way just to make others feel belittled. So try to see it as a reflection of their poor mental state. It's not your job to fix them, but be wary of engaging with individuals like this. Don't give them that twisted satisfaction of taking you down with them.In some rare cases, if you feel confident or emotionally removed enough from the situation, it can be worth attempting to calmly engage in a discussion, if you feel like this individual is misinformed, or open to discuss why they'd willingly say something hurtful... However, unfortunately in most cases, the individuals making comments like this just want to bring you down so they can feel better about themselves.What do you think can people can do in their own way to make the internet a kinder, more inclusive place?Being open to change and engaging with others, especially those outside of personal friend bubbles, or niche communities. This would naturally expose you to new, or different, life experiences and perspectives. It's super easy to get stuck in an echo chamber, and think that everyone has the same views as you. Engaging with diverse people from all walks of life may lead you to realize that you've maybe misjudged certain types of people, either because of upbringing, peer pressure, or the echo chamber effect. Naturally, with more knowledge and understanding of where views and beliefs come from (both negative and positive ones) we can decide what we align with morally, and make more informed and fair decisions. We're all human beings on our own journeys in life, but that shouldn't mean we should resort to unjustly tearing other people down to get ahead, or to look powerful. It just doesn't need to be that way.On a broad scale... If you ever feel personally threatened/offended/annoyed by a certain community or movement, maybe consider asking yourself why you feel this way? Where does this belief come from? Does whatever you disagree with really affect you personally? Do you know how much it means to the individuals/community/movement, and how it affects their everyday life?It's worth the time to do your research. You owe it to yourself to know you're being the person you want to be morally. You may find that yes, you disagree with certain things, and have the information from both sides to feel at peace with that. Other times, you might realize that you were perhaps being unfairly judgemental and biased.We all have to go through this process as part of the human experience. It's ok. Sure, we make mistakes and have regrets. So instead of feeling stuck or lost, know that can be learned from.All we can do is try to be more inclusive, more aware, and open to new experiences in life. Being open to kindness and empathy really does make a huge difference, for you and all those around you.What was your creative inspiration for your video in the #CreateKindness campaign?I don't tend to limit myself with style, as I love to experiment! But for this campaign, I wanted to weave in my appreciation for '90s aesthetics, and bold colors. It's definitely a vibe I've been having a lot of fun with recently.It's easy for these kinds of topics to get heavy regarding unwanted, unhelpful, and receiving hurtful comments online. So I decided to focus on keeping the expressions dynamic and playful, just to add that bit of pep back in to give the audience courage to deal with these issues, and of course, promote being kind!You can find Amy's video for the #CreateKindness campaign below, all month within our Discover page as well as permanently on @TikTokTips.

In addition to creating content, they run their own jewelry business and sell paintings made by their disabled sister to raise awareness and money for Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Alex is also working on music, which has been an extensive part of their life.Read more below about how the LGBTQ+ community has helped Alex find support and the freedom to live an authentic life.What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?I have always had an interest in the LGBTQ+ community since I was young. I didn’t realize this interest was because I was a part of it, but when I did, I truly blossomed into who I am today. To me personally, Pride is owning myself. Owning every part of me, whether it is feminine, masculine, androgynous, and everything in between. The meaning of Pride has changed for me over time because as I identified with the LGBTQ+ community, I found so many similarities between me and other members. This made me feel more confident, and in the end, hold more Pride in who I am.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?I identify as genderfluid/queer. This has impacted me in many different ways, from my wardrobe changing every day, to how I carry myself. It has truly shaped me into who I am today. Although not everything is sunshine and rainbows, such as showering with extreme body dysphoria or the people who will never accept me for who I am, I am still extremely happy with my identity and who I am today. That is all that matters.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?Although this past year has been tough to celebrate with my fellow members of the LGBTQ+ community due to COVID, I feel as though I can still celebrate by spreading who I am, educating others about the LGBTQ+ community, and how to be good allies to us. And who knows? I may attend an in-person Pride event this year since I’m fully vaxxed! There are also so many virtual Prides going on this year that can bring a community together from the comfort of your bedroom.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has inspired me in many ways. It’s honestly overwhelming seeing so many beautiful members of the LGBTQ+ community on my For You Page. I constantly get tagged in video recreations of my masculine to feminine transition TikToks. It is so amazing to see these beautiful creators express themselves in different ways, and to gain the confidence to do it from my videos. It will never get old.What video are you most proud of creating?It was a transition video using the sound \"Satisfaction\". It was one of my most viral videos at the time and a lot of big creators did the trend afterwards.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?The key to TikTok success is your confidence and being confident with your content. Literally, believe that your videos will do well and have that confidence throughout the process.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?Some advice I would give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community is that as different as you may seem or feel, I promise there is at least one person out there who feels the same. You are never alone when a part of the LGBTQ+ community, because you have a whole community behind you. Although no one may FULLY understand what you are going through, the people who TRY to understand are worthy of being in your life. Anyone who doesn’t support who you are, were not meant to see you blossom in the first place.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?People can be good allies to the LGBTQ+ community by simply respecting us as you would respect anyone else. Ask questions but also do your own research and education! It can be extremely overwhelming to someone who is struggling with their identity to receive questions about their struggle, and your own research can not only benefit you, but will also benefit the person you are trying to be a good ally to! It's not hard to be a good ally. Simply treat us like humans, because at the end of the day, we are all human.Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching (and why)?@jaxsilv is a queer trans activist and is very open about his journey. His TikTok followers helped him reach his goal for top surgery, and he has been documenting his journey on his page! I find it very educational & inspiring.@alyssareignnn is a bisexual creator on TikTok, and although her content is not LGBTQ+ based, she is very open about her sexuality and mental health. I find her videos extremely soothing and I never feel alone. She made a video awhile ago where people would comment with a certain emoji to tell others what their sexuality is, and one of the emojis was confused. At the time, I was very confused with my sexuality, and when I went to the comments, so many other people were too! It made me feel so validated knowing I’m not the only one who can struggle with labels. I’m still so grateful to this day for that video Alyssa made."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/juneteenth-black-talent-highlights","date":"2021-06-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Juneteenth Celebration of Black Talent","text":"Every day, people use TikTok to creatively express themselves and connect with audiences and communities worldwide. In honor of Juneteenth, we are highlighting Black creatives, learning more about their journeys on TikTok and what it means to be a standout talent on the platform. While the fight for social justice continues, so does our commitment to elevate and support Black voices. From celebrating their unique perspectives, to sharing their stories and educating their communities, these creators continue to make an incredible impact on culture and the trends that impact us all. We chatted with each of them to get the inside scoop on their favorite TikTok, how they find inspiration, and what Juneteenth means to them:@antonibumba I’m honestly the most proud of the latest series that I created on TikTok known as “The BBL Effect”. Even though it is a light-hearted, parody-toned concept, I believe that it empowers women and feminine people to be empowered by whatever part of them resonates with the content.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?My identity as a first generation, Black Congolese, non-binary person has inspired me tremendously over the years. It has shaped me into an individual who is as passionate, creative, and resilient as they are mindful, socially conscious, and progressive. I’ve faced so many challenges throughout my young years, that I’m sure would’ve broken so many people, but through my strength and love I get from friends, family, and the grace of God, my will to live is at an all time high.How do you celebrate Juneteenth and what does it mean to you?Juneteenth is a day that I choose to celebrate and reflect on – along with the rest of the Black community – all of the people who have paved the way for us to be where we are today, what we can do to continue to heal and move forward.

My recipe for vegan Mac n Cheese - to this day it's one of my favourite recipes!How has your identity influenced or shaped you?I’m a Black, British, Antiguan woman now living in America …so there are definitely a lot of layers to my identity. It was a huge culture shock when I moved here. Racism is a lot more 'in your face' and bold here, whereas it's more hidden back in the U.K. It was pretty tough to adjust to but now I'm grateful because I've learned so much. I embrace being a Black woman and a child of immigrants so much. I learned very early on from my granny that we have to work extra hard to get what we want and she hammered home the significance of education, because knowledge is power.How do you celebrate Juneteenth and what does it mean to you?If I’m honest, I’d never even heard of Juneteenth until I moved to America six years ago. It’s crazy to me that such a significant day in Black history is not more widely celebrated. I celebrate by relaxing, cooking my favourite food and hanging out with my family!How has the TikTok community inspired you?Although I create food content I mostly watch personal finance, skincare and family channels. Oh, and I love watching professional cleaners/ housekeeper channels. I find them so therapeutic and they inspire me to get up and clean my room!

Some people will love you, some will hate you, but it doesn't matter.Who are some Black TikTok creators that everyone should be following?@niccoya – she’s the moment.@haviahmighty The 'Peng Black Girls' video is the one I'm most proud of. It's got the highest number of views of all my videos, but also, the most positive engagement. It's a reminder for so many Black women globally that they are beautiful, loved and SEEN.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?As I introspectively dig into myself for understanding, growth, love and healing - everything I extract influences and shapes my existence and output. Who I am is so greatly intertwined with what I do (creating music) and in a society where people that look like me are often dismissed, I make it a point to celebrate all of the elements that make up \"self\".How do you celebrate Juneteeth and what does it mean to you?Juneteeth is a representation, to me, of how hard the Black community has to work for the smallest recognitions. While it represents the ending of the Civil War and the freeing of slaves, we are still fighting for equal rights today, bit by bit, step by step. I celebrate Juneteeth by continuing to do the work of normalizing the equality of Black existence.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok is a new sense of community. On this app, I've seen videos showcasing cultural differences, people educating others on themes or topics they may not understand, and fun challenges overall. It's a large hub of content where you can find whatever you're looking for, and you will find things you never knew you wanted to see. That's what inspires me most about TikTok!Who are some Black TikTok creators that everyone should be following?@omegamighty, a local Black artist/singer/makeupartist/dancer.

I love to laugh, I love to have a good time, and I’m a kind-spirited person at heart! When people see that you have a good spirit, it makes them want to love and support you more.How do you celebrate Juneteenth and what does it mean to you?I celebrate Juneteenth with my friends and family.

Especially when he hits the deep voice!@singkirbysing What video am I most proud of creating? My Aunt Jemima TikTok... undoubtedly. That video not only changed culture, but opened my eyes to how I could authentically be an activist.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?Identity influences everything that I do. The biggest question I ask myself 'is this authentic?' 'Is this in alignment with who I am or who I hope to be?' This question helps guide me and keep me rooted when I’m tempted to change who I am for a temporary benefit.How do you celebrate Juneteenth and what does it mean to you?With good food and great people. I believe that celebrating my friends' successes and how far we all have come honors those whose shoulders we stand on. This year I’ll be in NYC celebrating so I am super excited.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok is my digital happy place. I have to time myself because I can easily spend hours on the app, but I love that it’s such a positive space. It really is an app that encourages joy, and we needed that in 2020. In addition, the TikTok for Black Creatives program was such an eye opening experience. Being able to connect with young, Black, up-and-coming creatives and veterans in the entertainment industry reminded me that where I am now is just a part of the journey to get to where I want to be.Who are some Black TikTok creators that everyone should be following?@bomanizer, @taylorcassidyj, @jlbunny@theejoshneal My favorite TikTok would have to be this video.

It was able to authentically convey the work that we are doing to inspire the next generation to change the world.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?My identity has shaped me into who I am today. The combination of my Western and African roots has enabled me to have a unique perspective on the world.

We’re inspired by how they’ve embraced their authentic selves and how they’re encouraging others to live their lives freely and fully, too.Get to know Jesse Sulli (@jessesulli), a transgender father who shares his journey with the TikTok community on going from mom to dad, and raising his daughter Arlo. His mission is to highlight that not all families look the same, and to be a role model to young transgender people all over the world. Jesse wants LGBTQ+ people to feel not only heard, but celebrated and empowered. Read more below about Jesse's story, and how he's found power in owning his unique experience and identity.What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?For me, Pride means unapologetically celebrating who I am. Not just saying, “Hey I exist!”, but instead saying, “I exist and my transgender body is worth celebrating because it’s beautiful.\" I feel proud of who I am. Even when things get tough, I feel lucky to be me.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?It’s influenced almost every part of me. I remember deciding to come out as transgender, and that decision felt like climbing a mountain alone. The response from people close to me wasn’t great, but I knew if I wanted to raise my daughter authentically, I had to be honest with the world about who I am. Once I did, it felt like for the first time in my life every step I took was in the right direction. Breathing literally felt different, it felt better. And that shaped me to be a very empathetic and a very powerful person. I’ve lived the life of a woman, and have dealt with all the difficult parts of that, and I think it’s shaped me into a really great man. I think I can raise my daughter to be someone who changes the world because of my experience and identity.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?I feel like just showing my family to the world is how I support the community. I want to give my hand out to any young person who feels alone. I try to respond to as many LGBTQ+ people who reach out on social media for advice or help. If I could, I’d show up in person to give them a hug, and tell them how amazing they are. By connecting, we strengthen one another. I try to donate to transgender surgery crowdfunds, and support LGBTQ+ businesses. To me, we’re all a big worldwide family. We have to support one another!How has the TikTok community inspired you?It’s actually changed my life. It’s so inclusive and loving. Not only seeing other creators' unique and beautiful stories, but having people from all over, and from all types of backgrounds, support Arlo and I means more than they know. I started my transition right before the pandemic, and so it felt pretty lonely at times. The TikTok community inspired strength and pride during times I was struggling. It’s inspired me to be creative in new ways and connected me with people I never would have met. I honestly truly love the community.What video are you most proud of creating?Me showing myself from pregnancy until now. I was worried at first, but I wanted to show my full journey. I never thought it would catch on, and over night the response was overwhelming. Most of it was support and it was amazing.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?Make sure you have good lighting and you can actually see yourself. On a bigger scale, show your real story and connect with people. Show authentically who you are and where you came from -- the good and the bad. Create your own microcommunity online.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?My advice is to not only accept yourself, but love yourself fiercely. Celebrate who you are every day. If you’re in a home in which you are not supported, don’t lose sight of the rainbow light at the end. I promise you there’s a massive community of people ready to embrace you.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?By not only accepting LGBTQ+ people personally, but by standing up for them. If you hear a slur, or see mistreatment, stand up and say something. Tell family members, write social media posts, and vote for politicians who have LGBTQ+ people’s interests in mind.Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching (and why)?@Therealclaybaby is one of my favorites, not only is he hilarious but he spreads positivity and love. He talks about mental health and is so supportive of his community. @Ajclementine is a beautiful trans girl who does a great job of empowering herself and others, which I think is so important. @ladytragik is a badass musician and activist, who shows their journey starting a family with their wife."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-the-steps-were-taking-to-protect-wildlife-online","date":"2021-06-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"An update on the steps we're taking to protect wildlife online","text":"By Ayse Koçak, Policy Manager, Illegal Activities & Regulated GoodsEarlier this year, we were thrilled to join the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online. Established in 2018 by World Wildlife Fund (WWF), TRAFFIC and IFAW, the Coalition brings together e-commerce, search, and social platforms across the world to prevent wildlife trafficking online. Collaboration with partner organizations is critical when it comes to informing, shaping and strengthening our approach to safety, and today we would like to provide an update on how we're continuing our work to protect wildlife.To raise awareness among our community about the dangers of trading endangered species online, we will soon introduce two Public Service Announcements (PSA) that will be visible to people whenever they search for specific wildlife-related content or hashtags. We use PSAs to inform our community about certain issues and redirect them towards authoritative content.World Sea Turtle DayWe're announcing these updates to coincide with World Sea Turtle Day. Over the last two centuries these epic mariners have been pushed to the brink by human activity. Habitat-loss, poaching and commercial fishing have wrought havoc on these beautiful creatures - today, six of the seven species are threatened with extinction. Trading sea turtle species or their products is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) - yet criminal exploitation and illegal trafficking persists. The internet has also brought new avenues for criminals to exploit and traffic wildlife, which is why we're working with the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online to introduce these changes.Environmental champions and wildlife campaigners are working each day to save these magnificent animals. It's our hope that by implementing these changes, we can play our small part in ending their exploitation by criminal gangs and opportunists. TikTok is home to thousands of creators who are passionate about protecting the natural environment, celebrating the wildlife that we share this planet with, and sharing their stories with our community along the way.To date, there have been over 360 million views of content labelled #Conservation and over 165 million views of specific #SeaTurtle content. Some of TikTok's top creators in this area include Marine Biologist @carissaandclimate and National Geographic's TV Vet Paul Ramos (@vetpaulramos). Dr Paul Ramos, Veterinarian (@vetpaulramos) said:\"Wildlife around the world is under threat from human activity, including climate change, habitat loss and illegal trafficking. Saving our most beloved creatures is a complicated undertaking - but we can all help protect the natural world. I've seen how deeply the TikTok community cares about our planet and the creatures we share it with, and social media users have an important role to play in protecting wildlife online. I'm asking them to continue playing their part, whether that be reporting suspicious content, spreading awareness online or learning about the dangers of posing for photographs with exotic or endangered animals such as tigers or elephants.\" Carissa Cabrera, Marine Biologist (@carissaandclimate) said:\"Our oceans and wildlife that call it home are under extreme pressure from the climate crisis, overfishing, and pollution. Illegal trafficking of wildlife, including their eggs and babies, are leading threats to survival for species like sea turtles. Throughout the world, even in my home of Hawaii, wildlife trafficking is a growing problem. The internet can be a huge benefit for conservation efforts, but also brings new ways for traffickers to exploit our oceans. That's why it's so important that social media users report any suspicious content that they see online. I've witnessed the passion that the TikTok community has for the natural world, and I'm confident they will continue doing their part to protect our planet.\"Our progress on tackling wildlife trafficking onlineOur Community Guidelines make it clear that any content that depicts or promotes the poaching or illegal trade of wildlife is not allowed on our platform and will be removed when identified. Since joining the Coalition in March 2021, our teams have removed 73.5% of this kind of content before it received a single view. Our Advertising Policies also make it clear that we prohibit the advertising of products derived from protected animals or the sale of animals themselves.Giavanna Grein, Senior Program Officer, TRAFFIC at WWF said:“TikTok’s PSAs will help users better understand the link between wildlife content shared on the platform and the illegal wildlife trade, and empower them to help report suspicious content. Educating the public on this connection is an important step towards reducing wildlife trafficking across online platforms.”We're excited to continue working with the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online to protect some of our planet's most endangered animals and keep our community safe from harm. We're confident that this work will help TikTok remain a platform that brings joy and inspires creativity."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-sethsanker","date":"2021-06-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @sethsanker","text":"We’re celebrating Pride on TikTok this month, and shining a light on the incredible stories from our LGBTQ+ Trailblazers. Next up on our Creator Spotlight Series is Seth Sanker (@sethsanker), a photographer and fashion content creator in Southern California. He is a proud first-generation Asian American, and a gender non-conforming male who believes fashion has no gender. Seth is best known for turning pride flags into dresses on TikTok.Read more below about how the TikTok community has inspired Seth to embrace his true self.What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?Pride means family. Pride means having a community in your corner, no matter what. A family you weren't born into, but will stand with you through thick and thin. It's a community that is there to welcome you with open arms and without judgment. It's a place where you can be unapologetically yourself. I would say I've embraced Pride much more now. I'm leaning into this part of me, and letting it be seen as one of the best parts of me that is worthy of being celebrated!How has your identity influenced or shaped you?For a long time, I tried to make my identity not take over my entire personality. I realized that was just internalized homophobia and transphobia \"allowing\" me to be gay but not allowing me to embrace it! As I've gotten older, I've grown past that. I've worked through those internalized phobias, and embraced being queer to the fullest. It's one of the best parts of me, and I want everyone to know.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?I celebrate it by embracing it! I walk with my head held high every day, and I allow my queerness to shine! Being unapologetically queer is one of the biggest ways to celebrate the community, and showing everyone you love yourself. I also embrace my LGBTQ+ family. I celebrate them and lift them up. Give them as much space as they need to take up to be themselves!How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has inspired me SOOOO much! When I was growing up, we never had social media where we could be unapologetically ourselves. We didn't have an app that embraced queerness and brownness and just all the things that make us different. TikTok has helped me so much with my confidence and building back up my self worth, and giving me a space to truly be myself, and be embraced for being myself! It has given me sooo much fashion inspiration as well, and helped me realize fashion has no gender and everyone should be able to wear whatever they want.What video are you most proud of creating?The hotseat challenge video - it's the one that got me out there and that people know me for!What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?Consistency. Post as often as you can without getting burnt out. Put your mental health first and look out for yourself. Choose days where you bulk shoot content that way you don't have to make new videos every single day, or spread it out over a couple of days. Engage with your audience. Its super important, and it makes you feel real to your followers. Truly be yourself, especially on TikTok, an app that celebrates diversity and being different. The way to get a platform on TikTok is by celebrating what makes you different.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?Take as much time as you need. Don't rush into trying to find who you are. It takes time, and it's okay to change. Just because you've come out as one thing, doesn't make it any less valid if you come out as something else. You can take up as much space as you need and don't dull your shine for anyone. The world deserves to see you shining as bright as you possibly can. And do this for YOU. Don't seek validation in others. Your queerness is for you and for no one else.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?Uplift their voices. Make sure they are being heard. Research. Don't expect the queer community to come running to you with answers. It's your job to research first. It's not our job to educate you. Keep learning and unlearning. Do the work!Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching (and why)?@matt_and_omar, HILARIOUS.

We're driven by a passion to provide a welcoming space for people around the world, where they feel comfortable expressing themselves and being there for each other. This has inspired us to launch #CreateKindness, a global safety campaign and creative video series, as we continue to encourage everyone to choose kindness in their everyday lives.This month we're also spotlighting the six creator-animators we partnered with to help bring the campaign to life. These talented creators wrote, animated, and lent their voices to their videos, which infuse their distinctive style with their personal experiences with online bullying.Today, we celebrate illustrator and animator Kelly Emmrich (@kellyemmrich), who started creating TikTok videos at the beginning of the pandemic to recreate the beautiful nature scenes she witnessed around her. Kelly's pensive art style complements the profound themes she explores through her art.How would you describe your art style?I would say that my style is pretty painterly. I think color-wise, and a lot of the time style-wise, my art style in the Pop Art realm. I'm not entirely sure how to classify it, but I do gravitate towards charcoal brushes in photoshop. I like to play a lot with texture and color when I animate.Has TikTok inspired your art in any way? What makes you continue to create and share your art on TikTok?I started initially sharing for myself just to create an online portfolio of sorts. I still share for that same reason, but some of the comments that I started getting during the early months of quarantine really made me want to continue posting publicly. 2020 was such a stressful and trying year, and I tried to make calming and peaceful content. A lot of the comments were essentially that people had been having a tough time and my videos helped them calm down in a stressful moment. Another reason that I've continued to post and be inspired to create is all of the talent on the app. I get so inspired scrolling and am constantly saving audios that I want to create a video around and seeing new framing ideas for my animations.What's the kindest comment (about your art) you've received on TikTok?I think my favorite comments are the ones that show that one of my videos impacted someone in a positive way. A comment I got on one of my recent videos was \"This is amazing. Your videos always make my day better.\" Something like that is just so nice to read and it makes me feel like my videos are helping people in a little way.If you had to sketch/illustrate kindness, what would it look like?I associate kindness with nature for some reason; so, it would probably be a drawing of a hand lifting a ladybug up to take flight or something. I grew up in a rural area, so I was always taught to be kind and gentle with the land and the animals surrounding me (including bugs). Or it would be a hug. Because I'm a pretty tactile touchy feely person, just supporting someone else illustrates my idea of kindness.Which TikTok creators do you admire or inspire you?Tons of people inspire me. I really love @monkyyboy, @dedouze, @dalooch, and @madelaineturner — they all have such creative videos and workflows that are endlessly inspiring me.What do you think makes the TikTok community so special?The Tiktok community is especially kind. I mostly interact with the film and art sides of TikTok, and everyone that I've interacted with has been endlessly creative and supportive. I think that the app has garnered a real sense of community. It doesn't feel overly competitive and it feels like there is plenty of space for everyone on the app which is a nice thing to be around.Why do you think people bully or try to hurt one another, especially online?It's difficult to pinpoint one specific reason, but, for online, there is a certain anonymity to it that makes it feel more comfortable for people to be meaner and say things that they wouldn't say offline. Perhaps with social media it's easy to feel jealousy and take it out on others to knock them down. It's tough to see that happen because then it's common to see people jump on the bandwagon of attacking a person.What do you think can people can do in their own way to make the internet a kinder, more inclusive place?I think making an effort to comment on other peoples videos goes a long way. When people comment something on my page that I find really nice it really makes my day. Those commenters don't realize how much a kind comment could mean to someone. Just that little thing could make a world of difference.What does the #CreateKindness campaign mean to you?I feel honored to have been asked by TikTok to be a part of it. I think this past year has been so challenging and the Internet has become a place of comfort; so, it's hard to see negative things happening online and on such a comforting app. For me, making something inspirational is very important now more than ever. Art has long had social justice undertones, and it's important to continue that.What do you want people to understand about your video for the #CreateKindness campaign?For this project, I wanted to create a video that reminds people that while it's easy to get lost and fixate on negative comments, the positive typically outweighs the negative. I pulled from some real negative and positive comments that I've gotten on Tiktok to try to make it more personal to me. I also used the woods behind my home as references for the outdoor backgrounds. As for the choice to write a poem instead of a traditional script, I wanted to make the video feel most authentic to my style. A poem just felt more natural to me.You can find Kelly's video for the #CreateKindness below, all month within our Discover page as well as permanently on @TikTokTips.

What makes you continue to create and share your art on TikTok?A lot of my art now is actually based around content I watch on TikTok that relates to something that I've personally experienced.What's the kindest comment (about your art) you've received on TikTok?\"Why aren't you on Cartoon Network!\" has been the best comment I've ever received.If you had to illustrate kindness, what would it look like?For me, kindness would look like the Little Angel character, from my video for the campaign, with a big bright smile and a sweet drawl to the way they talk.Which TikTok creators do you admire or inspire you?I am inspired by many creators, but the ones that stand out to me most are @felleanimated, @KallmeKris @ItskingChris, and @zobeebop.What do you think makes the TikTok community so special?For me, the magic lies in just how accepting the platform is towards new creators.Why do you think people bully or try to hurt one another, especially online?I think people bully for two main reasons: the first being because of the negative things they're experiencing in their lives, and the second being because they believe the people they are bullying won't see the comment.What do you think can people can do in their own way to make the internet a kinder, more inclusive place?I think simply responding back to others with kindness can go a long way.What do you want people to understand about your video for the #CreateKindness campaign?When I heard about the campaign, I was going through a moment with a career shift where I was doubting myself constantly, but for some reason there was always a voice in my head telling me you will be just fine. So, in my video I decided that I would like to be that voice for others, and let them know everything will be okay. That's where the Little Angel and Little Devil characters were first born, but the first thing I designed for this animation was specifically the Little Angel's voice, which is a voice I use to brighten up my friends' days. I thought it was a perfect fit for the sweet loving voice in people's head that reminds them that all will be well.You can find Edmond's video for the #CreateKindness campaign below, all month within our Discover page as well as permanently on @TikTokTips. We also invite you to share the kind comments you've received and inspiring moments you've experienced by joining our #CreateKindness hashtag challenge.New to TikTok?

She uses her platform on TikTok to advocate for change not only in the LGBTQ+ community, but also for women's sports across the country.Read more below about how she’s found the courage to own her identity and bring attention to inequalities and injustices within the LGBTQ+ community.What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?Pride means a lot to me since I first came out as a lesbian through the TikTok platform. I was able to have a community that supports and loves me, which has given me the courage to speak up about inequalities and injustices. Watching myself grow and become much more confident about my sexuality is an amazing feeling, and I hope to help others also become confident with their own sexuality.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?Being a female athlete is difficult enough, and being gay has added a lot of more struggles in my career field. Being able to own my identity, and share my love with the world, has given me strength and courage to be a leader in my field. I also feel connected with the LGBTQ+ community because I can relate to the many struggles that others go through daily.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?Understanding that our community is so vast and diverse makes us even stronger. When we realize that there are so many inequalities within our community, it brings us together to fight against them, which strengthens us as whole. I have noticed that I have such a large fan base that supports every part of my identity, and accepts me for who I am, which is what makes our community so special.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has inspired me because it is an app that allows for stories to be shared and news to be spread. I have met some truly amazing people within the LGBTQ+ community on the app, and we have shared stories of struggles and perseverance. By using our voices, and not being silenced, we are able to become unified, which continue to help further LGBTQ+ generations.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?My advice would be to be your true self, even if you are scared of what people will think. Before I came out, I was scared of how people would look at me, and if I would lose friends or even family members. Now, as a LGBTQ+ creator with a large following, I see that by coming out, I have not only made even better friends that love and accept me, but I have helped inspire others, and shown them how incredible it feels to be your true self.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?People can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community by supporting us and sharing our stories. There is a lot of toxicity from people who are against the LGBTQ+ community, and when they begin to spread hatred, allies must step up and use their voices to stop it. When we work together for equality and representation, we can come to a common goal quicker and easier, and help many people in our community feel represented.Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching (and why)?One of my favorite LGBTQ+ TikTok creators is @noelmulk0. He not only speaks about how fitness saved his life from addiction, but he also shares light on asexuality and his struggles through it. He is one of the most positive and loving influencers I have ever interacted with, and if you don't follow him, you absolutely should."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-geronimo-warrior","date":"2021-06-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @geronimo.warrior","text":"TikTok’s community is a place where differences are embraced and people are free to be their authentic selves. Next up in our Creator Spotlight Series, we’re celebrating another one of our inspiring LGBTQ+ Trailblazers, Geronimo Louie (@geronimo.warrior), and highlighting his journey to share his true self with the world.Geronimo is an Indigenous person from the Chiricahua Apache band and the Navajo Nation. He identifies as “two-spirit” or “Indigenous queer.” He’s not only an Indigenous fashion designer whose traditional ribbon work has been featured in Vogue, but a talented TikTok creator who teaches people about cultural sensitivity and respect. Read more below about how Geronimo is shining a light on his people and their sacred culture.What does Pride mean to you? How has that meaning changed for you over time?For me, Pride is a reminder of our history as queer folk. We have to remember the past in order to do better for the future. Over time it has changed me to be a better person. It has taught me the importance of queer rights and how much we still have to fight for. That is why I became part of Diné Pride, a small organization that focuses on Indigenous queer peoples. We uplift our Indigenous queer people through scholarships, and we support them by hosting our own Pride event.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?My identity has shaped me to be more in touch with my culture. As an Indigenous person, it wasn’t easy finding my way through the LGBTQ+ community because of systemic racism and overall cultural appropriation. As a “two spirit” person, I have to constantly educate non-Indigenous queer people about what it means to be two spirit and where it comes from. However, once I got in touch with my roots and my fellow Indigenous queer people, I found my place within our community. I’m finally ready to be who I am without hesitation.How do you celebrate the diversity/strength of (and also support) the LGBTQ+ community?I celebrate the diversity and strength of the LGBTQ+ community by being myself as a Indigenous queer person. Recognizing my sacredness and the resilience we’ve had for hundreds of years, even after colonization. I also support the community by recognizing other queer of people of color who also get misrepresented and pushed to the side. I see them and understand their pain. We come together and remember our history and our advocacy.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community has inspired me to be more open with people from across the world. I’m exposed to so many different people. I’m inspired to learn not only where they come from, but how I can help them. TikTok has really helped me get in touch with a lot of amazing people of color and learn about their cultures, their issues, and their strengths.What video are you most proud of creating?I am proud of all my videos, especially the ones where I get to inform people. It may get difficult, but using our voices to speak out on things is important. In some ways it can be therapeutic because I get to share content with other people who share my opinion. This video touches on culture appropriation vs appreciation, proper representation, and welcoming indigenous people to work spaces.What are some content creation tips you would offer to other creators?Quality over quantity is what I stick to. I want to make content that I will enjoy watching over and over again. Content that’s meaningful to me that can also connect to other people. So always be yourself. It's okay to create silly content too -- not all of my videos are about education.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?My advice to the next generation would have to be love. It’s a cliché, but I truly believe in love. Love is powerful. Love for yourself, love for your community. From love, strength will come, and from strength, wisdom will follow. Be proud of how far we have come. Be sure of how far you will go.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?To me, allies are people who want to help a certain community. For the LGBTQ+ community, allies should look into learning the real history of Pride, genders, and queer people overall. Allies should also support the community by educating others and providing resources that are needed. Allies need to help abolish the gender norms that Western society/ colonizers have put in place.Who are some LGBTQ+ TikTok creators that everyone should be following/watching (and why)?People should support queer people of color, especially Black trans people. Here are some people I follow: @kissyduerre, @devdoee, @xochitlarte, @giiwedinindizhinikaaz, @jadeexbadu."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-time-for-adultswim","date":"2021-06-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: Time for #adultswim","text":"TikTok creators make the \"bumps\" with the #adultswim trend.

The immense diversity of people and content on our platform is what makes TikTok such a special place – from people outlining the sources of their unique qualities through the mosaic trend to sharing their customs and traditional food with #culturechallenge. We are driven by our passion to maintain a welcoming environment for our global community, and over the last year we’ve introduced a range of features aimed at fostering kindness and preventing bullying.Today we're taking another step with the launch of #CreateKindness, a global campaign and a creative video series aimed at raising awareness around online bullying and how we can all choose kindness.Promoting awareness around bullyingAt TikTok, we value the trust of our community and work hard to maintain it by cultivating an inclusive atmosphere. Bullying behavior damages the trust-based nature of the app by harming people's confidence in themselves. We're mindful that although in-app interactions may seem harmless to some, the impact of people's online experiences don't always disappear when they close the app. This is why we greatly value the stories from our community about their experiences and why we invest in measures to help TikTok remain a place where kindness and compassion thrive.As part of our ongoing commitment to promote online kindness, we're launching on our @TikTokTips account an animated video series that tells the real and personal stories of six creator-animators whose distinct animation styles complements their diverse experiences.Through their videos, these talented creators offer perspectives on how to counter bullying, show the unintended impact this harmful behavior can have, and remind us why it's important that we work together to prevent it.In \"Block the Bullies\" @milkymichii shows how to deal with unkind Duets.Through the introspective \"Why Would You...\" @recokh illuminates how his insecurities are behind the desire to be unkind to others and how to navigate these feelings.With \"I Want to Hold On To\" @kellyemmrich shares how to overcome negative comments by focusing on the communities that celebrate her.In \"Walk Away\" @wowrightmeow gives advice on how they deal with people intentionally misrepresenting their thoughts.In \"Power of Words\" @rosie.gif explores the impact that micro-aggressions can have and implores people to think before they post.Through \"What We Don't See\" @king.science encourages people to treat one another with care and compassion.By using their distinctive animation styles and voices, and revealing themselves at the end of the videos, these creators drive home an important message: behind every account is a real human being who deserves to be treated with kindness and respect.Spreading kindness on TikTokTikTok communities thrive when kindness and care are at the forefront. Videos using hashtags related to kindness, including #love and #kindness, have garnered over 400 billion views and generated almost 50 billion video creations around the world.Heart stickers and creative effects are also among the most popular product features used on TikTok to celebrate kindness. These have been added to over 2 billion videos globally in the past year, with our communities in the US, Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico using them the most.Fostering kindness on TikTokWe're committed to promoting well-being and positive online behavior as we strive to make meaningful and enjoyable experiences possible for everyone. This includes working to remove content and accounts associated with harassment and bullying. Bullying is not tolerated on TikTok, and we work to combat it through our policies, features, and partners, such as the Cyberbullying Research Center, as we continue to champion comprehensive approaches to online safety.In addition to these videos, which can be found all month within our Discover page and on @TikTokTips, we invite our community to participate in the #CreateKindness hashtag challenge by creating TikTok videos that share the heart-warming moments and comments that inspire you to spread kindness.Through this campaign, we invite our community to choose, celebrate, and create kindness with one another, every day.New to TikTok?

We recognize that small business owners are recovering and rebuilding after a year like no other and that Black-owned businesses have been disproportionately impacted. More than half of all Black-owned businesses saw their revenue drop during the pandemic compared to 37% of white-owned businesses.We are committed to not only reflecting on why these discrepancies exist, but taking action to reverse generations of economic hardship and lift up Black small business owners on our platform. Last year, we launched Support Black Businesses, an online hub where Black entrepreneurs can learn about TikTok's ongoing partnerships and initiatives that drive awareness, support and patronage of their businesses. This hub built upon our broader efforts to promote inclusivity in entrepreneurship, including a $500,000 donation to the Accion Opportunity Fund last summer to provide relief to Black small business owners impacted by COVID-19.Today we are proud to announce that we are accepting applications for the next cohort of Support Black Businesses!

It was inspiring and gave us a strong sense of community as we were able to openly discuss our challenges as Black small business owners.\" Amplifying Black voices through videoParticipants in the program will benefit from $1000 in ad credits, roundtables with TikTok Creators, full access to Vimeo's Business tier tools to create, produce, host, share and stream pro-quality video and hands-on training, including a video creation workshop cohosted with Vimeo.\"Video is the most engaging medium available to businesses large and small to communicate, collaborate and connect,\" said Harris Beber, CMO at Vimeo. \"What we have learned from the pandemic is that using video for your business is no longer a nice to have, it's a need to have. We're proud to partner with TikTok on Support Black Businesses by providing our tools and expertise to help the participants harness the power of video to build their businesses. Vimeo is committed to supporting a diverse and thriving community.\"Video is a powerful tool for storytelling. Whether it's a 15-second vertical shot created on a phone or an action-packed scene filmed in HD, video allows us to be in someone else's shoes and amplifies the voice of the person behind the camera. Our goal with Support Black Businesses is to amplify and elevate the voices of the Black community, and we hope these workshops will give business-owners valuable video skills that will help them reach people and thrive.Supporting Black EntrepreneursSupport Black Business is also proud to partner with Talent x Opportunity (TxO), an accelerator program led by Andreessen Horowitz.

It means not basing your entire life on your sexuality or identity, while also knowing those are important parts of who you are.How has your identity influenced or shaped you?As a trans woman of color, I have learned how cruel and horrible the world can be.

It has really played a huge part in allowing me to be myself and knowing that it's OK to be who I am. Truthfully, it was TikTok that really gave me the push that I needed to come out as trans and live the life I was always meant to live.What advice would you give to the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community?I would like to tell the next generation of the LGBTQ+ community that it’s most important to always continue to work on yourself and your mental health, and to make sure you are in a good mental state before ever worrying about pleasing others or how you appear to others. I would also like to tell them to always continue to be themselves and not let anyone else try to tell them who they are.How do you think people can be allies to the LGBTQ+ community?I believe that being educated is the first and most important part of being an ally.

Every time I get to talk to another creator, they give me more motivation to continue doing what I love. By seeing how much fun and creativity they have, those vibes flow my way, and I start to have more energy and creativity to think of new content.

We want to take this time to celebrate API business owners and creators on TikTok and shine the spotlight on businesses that make impact our communities and in our lives.As part of our celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, TikTok launched #SpotlightAPI to support API-owned small and medium-sized businesses across North America. For the next two months, #SpotlightAPI is highlighting API-owned small and medium businesses with high-visibility media placements, TikTok education, and community support. Since kicking off the campaign, videos with the hashtag #SpotlightAPI have been viewed more than 7 billion times, and API small business owners are benefitting. \"We're proud to celebrate our Asian heritage by using the recipes we grew up with to make delicious food for people to enjoy,\" said Julia Zhu, co-owner of United Dumplings in San Francisco, CA. \"TikTok's SpotlightAPI effort is helping small business owners across North America to reach people and thrive, and we're incredibly grateful to be a part of this cohort.

In addition to these partnerships, TikTok is hosting an intimate workshop for API-owned small businesses to learn how to tap into the opportunities on the platform. In particular, participants will learn how to harness their creativity on TikTok, hear from API-owned advertising agencies on best advertising practices, and get a chance to ask TikTok leaders their burning questions. The workshops will also provide a safe space for those who want to voice their concerns over the increase in hate crimes against the API community and give business owners the opportunity to feel connected to one another.

And join him and @inmyseams as they co-host \"This is API Celebration,\" the API Heritage Month finale event on TikTok LIVE on Thursday, May 27 at 6pm PT/ 9pm ET.How has your culture influenced or shaped you?Being Asian is a huge part of my life and something I’m very proud to be. Growing up, I didn’t see myself represented in media/entertainment in a positive light. I was mocked a lot and experienced a lot of microaggressions – the media’s representation was definitely different from how I lived my everyday life. These obstacles pushed me to find myself more and made me want to pursue a position in the media where I can give the younger generation of Asians a role model I wish I had.How do you celebrate the diversity and strength of the API community?I celebrate the API community by giving back and supporting local API businesses and restaurants, and also giving a spotlight to Asian creatives and Asians in media and entertainment. I also use my voice and platform to talk about social issues regarding the API community and showcase the many different cultures within the API community in a positive and appreciative light. I think things like this program are definitely the right steps to celebrating diversity/strength of the API community.What Does API heritage mean to you?I grew up in a community that was predominantly Asian and I was very VERY privileged to have grown up around people just like me — people who celebrate the same things that I celebrate, or who would eat the same food that I eat. I didn’t really appreciate this type of love and community until I left my hometown and experienced, as I mentioned before, racism and microaggressions. These things would also follow me online. When I first began making content, the ignorance a lot of these actions carried made me realize: I want to educate and showcase my culture, that is a lot of who I am, in a positive light. I want to also break boundaries for Asians in entertainment and media and be a leading role model for younger Asian kids who don’t have a sense of Asian pride or community.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok showed me that there were more Asians out there that had a passion to create too, and they definitely pushed me to make greater content. It was isolating and confusing when I first started because I didn’t see Asian creators that were making content that wasn’t mocking their own culture or just ONLY content about being Asian like it was their only personality trait. But because of TikTok, I was able to find a platform to show my creations and find supporters. Through my highs and lows, the fans definitely inspired me so much throughout the years. From my starting days when I had a few followers to now, the immense support I’ve received over the years showed me that I could inspire others and that I could make funny and meaningful content — all while being Asian.How do you support other creators in the API community and who are some API creators that everyone should be following/watching?I strive to set a good example for other Asian creators. I’ve had a lot of Asian creatives reach out and tell me how amazing they felt when seeing someone like them making cool stuff. I think I’ve definitely encouraged a lot of fellow Asian creators to passionately create and push themselves and, of course, they inspire me as well. Some Asian creators I really like and who share good messages are @wholesomesimon and @7eremeiah."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-siriusxm-to-create-exclusive-audio-experiences-including-siriusxm-music-channel-and-pandora-playlists","date":"2021-05-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"TikTok and SiriusXM to Create Exclusive Audio Experiences including SiriusXM Music Channel and Pandora Playlists","text":"TikTok and SiriusXM to Create Exclusive Audio Experiences including SiriusXM Music Channel and Pandora PlaylistsNew SiriusXM channel -- TikTok Radio, a groundbreaking full-time SiriusXM music channel -- will be part of TikTok collaboration across SiriusXM and Pandora  Beginning today, Pandora is launching a series of playlists hosted by top TikTok creators including Bella Poarch, Christian Shelton and Nick TangorraNEW YORK, NY & CULVER CITY, CA (May 24, 2021) - TikTok, SiriusXM and Pandora today announced they are joining forces on the rollout of new and innovative content across each of their platforms.

People put their hearts and souls into creating and entertaining on TikTok, and we recognize how discouraging it can feel to receive unkind comments on videos. So we're introducing the ability to delete multiple comments at once or report them for potentially violating our Community Guidelines. Accounts that post bullying or other negative comments can now be blocked in bulk, too. We hope this update helps creators feel more empowered over their experience on TikTok.To manage interactions on a video, people can long-press on a comment or tap the pencil icon in the upper left corner to open a window of options. From there, people can now select up to 100 comments or accounts rather than having to go one by one, making it more seamless to delete or report multiple comments or block users in bulk.This feature is rolling out today in select markets and more globally over the coming weeks and builds upon ongoing efforts to promote a kind and welcoming community. For instance, we recently introduced a way to filter all comments so that only those a creator chooses will appear on their content. People are also prompted to reconsider posting a potentially unkind comment on a video. And, users ages 13-17 have additional safeguards on their accounts designed to promote an age-appropriate experience, including restrictions on Duet, Stitch, DMs, and comments.As we develop tools to combat bullying, we also work to educate teens and families about bullying prevention. Earlier this month we launched a new bullying prevention guide on our Safety Center to help families learn how to identify bullying as well as tools to counter bullying and provide help to bullying victims or bystanders. The more we can stamp out bullying behavior, the more welcoming and fun TikTok will be for everyone."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-mosaic-of-the-people-around-us","date":"2021-05-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: #Mosaic of the people around us","text":"TikTok creators tell us where they come from with #Mosaic.

Because both my parents came from what is now known as North Korea and lived in poverty for so much of their lives, I have a better understanding of how much safety and joy food can bring. This is particularly true for those who end up leaving their native countries (for whatever reason), since often times, their ethnic cuisines are one of the few things they have that remind them of home. I have learned that being a 1.5 generation Korean-American (i.e., born here, but with immigrant parents) is a daily struggle to negotiate being both Korean and American, while being neither Korean nor American enough for some. That struggle doesn't define me, but it has indisputably shaped me, providing insight into the collective pain caused by racism, the importance of solidarity, the demand for compassion. This insight is what gives flavor to my food, meaning to my words, and power to my voice.How do you celebrate the diversity and strength of the API community?By sharing their food and their stories, while also listening to and learning from them.What Does API heritage mean to you?Heritage is personal to me. I think of my grandmothers. Their hands, as they snipped the tails of mung beans or peeled an apple. I think of my grandmother's voice, as she sang hymns to pass the time, the hibiscus plant in our backyard--from a cutting my grandfather brought to Chicago all the way from Korea. I think of cheering for Korea during the 2002 World Cup, the way my father started sobbing when Korea made it to the semi-finals. I think about the time my mother told me that my penmanship needed to be \"extra\" perfect when I was in 3rd grade, and me wondering why mine needed to be \"more perfect\" than everyone else's. And I think about the time a colleague of mine told me I was \"too Korean,\" or the time someone messaged me to \"go back to China.\" I think of the stories my father wrote to me a few years ago, about my great grandparents, their home in Korea, how my grandmother fled North Korea with my father swaddled onto her back, how my father used to count out the number of beans he could eat in a day, how his favorite thing to eat was a piece of fried dough right out of the fryer when it was so cold outside his fingers would start to grow numb. I think of heritage as a thick, intricately woven cloth, one that I wrap around myself, made up of both the beautiful and the ugly, as stories are wont to be. Because heritage is nothing without stories, nothing without the heart to tell them.How has the TikTok community inspired you?The TikTok community makes me feel safe enough to share some of the most intimate details of my life and my family. They have welcomed my parents, they have embraced me, and have even been very polite about my vegan food!! The community has fostered an environment that encourages me to continue the mission of The Korean Vegan: to humanize the immigrant story and inspire compassion through food and storytelling. The content creators I have come to love on this platform inspire me to do so responsibly, passionately, and with sincerity.How do you support other creators in the API community and who are some API creators that everyone should be following/watching?I try to follow and engage with as many API content creators as possible. I've left comments on their posts or DM'd them directly when their posts resonate with me. I've also shared their accounts with my own followers (on TikTok and my other social platforms), chatted with many of them about the pressure of social media, and identified some of my favorites during interviews with press. My hope is that when we are able to travel again, we can find ways to collaborate more directly. My favorite API creators include: @Youngqim, @chefjonkung, @bootlegmegz, @yourkoreandad, @chefchrischo, @jeenie.weenie, @inmyseams, @porojin, @sheenamelwani, and @jackieliuart."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/museummoment-tiktok-hosts-its-first-ever-global-live-museum-marathon","date":"2021-05-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"#MuseumMoment: TikTok hosts its first-ever global LIVE museum marathon","text":"As a global entertainment platform, TikTok is a place that celebrates cultural expression and the arts, empowering communities to discover culture in every corner of the globe, from art and music to dance and theater.

Those three things are ingrained in our culture and it's the reason why we see and cheer on so many successful people within our community. You need to have those traits to get through this life.How do you celebrate the diversity and strength of the API community?I celebrate by sharing content that I feel is an honorable and respectable representation of talent from the API community. I share movies, books, creators, and more whenever I get the chance. I love to illuminate all the beautiful people within our community who are doing big things. Just remember, the norms set within our culture and the norms that are practiced make Asians in entertainment, quite frankly, disrupters. We are going against what’s expected typically of us. We’ve gone against norms set within our culture / family / the standards society has viewed us with. Sharing these disruptive creators and entertainers is my way to celebrate.What Does API heritage mean to you?It's a chance to illuminate role models. Asian role models. Growing up, I didn't really have any female Asian American creators or celebrities to look up to. I think celebrating our heritage and illuminating creators from our culture will put a spotlight on role models for the future generation. This is something really important to me. I really do feel that everyone who has been selected is filling a void. And I want to help fill that void for the next generation.How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok inspires me every single day. It honestly lifted me up in one of my lowest moments of life. I had just gotten out of the Navy and I didn't know what to do with my life. And I was going through some pretty dark times. But through TikTok, I found a community who was so supportive and always there for me, encouraging me to be myself. The community created me. I'm so honored and humbled to be here and to be an API Trailblazer.How do you support other creators in the API community and who are some API creators that everyone should be following/watching?It's inspiring to see how supportive we are of each other.

I also love sharing and supporting other API creators and all their vast endeavors! It's all about coming together as a community and uplifting others as well!What Does API heritage mean to you?API Heritage to me is just a small part of the big picture. Being a South Indian immigrant and moving to a non-diverse area as a 10 year old and this journey to grow, accept and love my culture was not the easiest journey. Over the years it's been a constant battle between assimilating and sticking to my roots but eventually I realized how important my heritage is and it translates to who I am and who my people were over centuries.How has the TikTok community inspired you?Tiktok has inspired me by giving me an opportunity to showcase my culture and reach people I never knew even wanted to see my content. To see people genuinely interested in other communities and cultures makes me so happy to continue creating content as well. Not a day goes by where I don't learn something new. It could be anywhere from fashion to cooking to conspiracy theories. You name it and there's a community for that niche and that's what I love the most is that you really do find your community no matter who you are. The support I've gotten from my fashion looks to makeup adventures have been very kind and immense and I'm thankful to have been a part of this community that allows me to share who I am as well.How do you support other creators in the API community and who are some API creators that everyone should be following/watching?I support other creators by, first off, the basics, such as simply following and showing love on their content and just being there! I also love sharing their platforms to my audience any time I can to show their amazing work as I genuinely get excited to see my favorite creators' post and need more people to dwell in the awe!

Take a deeper look at this content in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects.Trending on TikTok: #NotTheMainCharacterThis week the TikTok community took a vintage trend and turned it on its head. We always talk about the main characters, but what about the creators who are #NotTheMainCharacter?The TikTok community is at the forefront of developing new terminology, idioms, and slang. This time last year, the phrase \"main character\" was used in a variety of contexts to speak to a specific energy related to personal agency in someone's life. You might say that a role model or idol of yours has \"main character energy,\" as if they're the main character of a novel. Alternatively, you might say that you're acting as a main character in moments where you rightly or wrongly idealize your life, such as dramatically walking into a new school. From mid to late 2020, \"main character\" was an ever present phrase across the TikTok ecosystem that led to a variety of #MainCharacter trends.This week, the community made a callback to that popular terminology with #NotTheMainCharacter, where users showcased exactly which supporting role they would play in a novel, television series or film. Creators would transition from TikTok Text setting up the video to a series of character images, all set to a cover of \"Dancing Queen\" from the film Mamma Mia. Whether they were \"older siblings,\" \"judgmental duos,\" or even a \"hot mess,\" the trend was a simple, inclusive, and let creators poke fun at themselves.#NotTheMainCharacter shows how TikTok looks to past content formats for inspiration, and shows how maintaining awareness of former videos, trends, and creators will help you better understand new trends as they emerge. Notable Video Hot Track: Astronaut In The OceanMaskedWolf's \"Astronaut In The Ocean\" has become the track of choice for creators looking to show of an impressive skill or physical move in slow motion.

Read more below about how Janette's heritage has impacted her life and time on TikTok and how she supports other creators online!How has your culture influenced or shaped you?Growing up as a second generation Korean American with immigrant parents was not easy in a upper middle class white suburban neighborhood. We experienced a lot of discrimination and racism just by the way that we looked. My parents had to work 2 to 3 times harder than everyone else because they didn't speak the same language or look the same to try and gain the respect of those around them. However, this story is not an unfamiliar one. As I grew older and more passionate about my culture and upbringing, I met many men and women who shared a very similar story to me. Knowing that I wasn't alone was very comforting but it also made me want to amplify my voice to those who may not have had the same education and treated people who look like me kindly.How do you celebrate the diversity and strength of the API community?The API Community is so diverse and colorful! We're such a versatile group of men and women who come from rich backgrounds and histories. To be able to represent even 1% of that is an honor but also using my platform to celebrate the other's in my community is a lifelong goal of mine.What Does API heritage mean to you?API heritage is a celebration of our ancestors and their dreams. There are so many men and women who have sacrificed their dreams so that we, the API community, could be recognized today in this capacity. Being a part of the API community is an honor but also a stepping stone for the generations to come before me to feel empowered to not shy away from who they are and unapologetically walk this earth with confidence!How has the TikTok community inspired you?TikTok has reshaped the landscape of social media. It has taken all of us back to the authenticity of content creation. The community of diverse men and women on the platform who are just themselves each and every day inspires me to continue to discover who I am and celebrate who I am becoming.How do you support other creators in the API community and who are some API creators that everyone should be following/watching?Some creators that inspire me are: @thekoreanvegan, @YourKoreanDad, @GlowwithAva, @Nabela, @Chunkysdead, and @Alanchikenchow.

From parents sharing their best tips (#momhack has 1.8B views) to senior citizens showing epic reunions with their best friends and family after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, TikTok is home for a diverse range of communities to express themselves creatively and be entertained.And every day, thousands of safety professionals at TikTok are tasked with the critical job of helping keep our community safe. One part of this work involves designing strategies and tools that prioritize age-appropriate experiences. In this post, we'll explain more about how we work to keep the full TikTok experience a place for people 13 and older and identify those who may have mistakenly registered for the incorrect app experience.Promoting age-appropriate experiencesTikTok has a 12+ rating in the App Store which lets parents use device-level parental controls to block their teen from downloading the app. To direct people to the age-appropriate experience, we've designed a neutral, industry-standard age-gate that requires people to fill in their complete birthdate to discourage people from simply clicking a pre-populated minimum age. In the US, if someone enters a birthday that confirms they're under 13, they'll be directed into TikTok for Younger Users, a curated viewing experience with additional safeguards and privacy protections designed specifically for this audience. Through our partnership with Common Sense Networks, we work to provide these users with a safe and age-appropriate viewing experience.Removing suspected underage accountsWhile most people understand the importance of being truthful about their age, some do not provide the correct information, which is a challenge many online services face. That's why our commitment to enforcing our minimum age requirements does not end at the age gate, and we take a number of additional approaches to identify and remove suspected underage account holders. First, we train our safety moderation team to be alert to signs that an account may be used by a child under the age of 13. We also use other information as provided by our users, such as keywords and in-app reports from our community, to help surface potential underage accounts. When our safety team believes that an account may belong to an underage person, the account will be suspended.Bringing more transparency to our actionsIn our last Transparency Report we published the number of accounts removed for violating our Community Guidelines. To bring more visibility to the actions we take to protect minors, we'll also begin sharing similar information regarding removals of suspected underage accounts, starting with our next report. We've continued to expand the information provided in these reports, such as publishing the volume of reinstated content that was appealed, to help the industry move forward by leading the way when it comes to transparency and accountability around user safety.Creating an age-appropriate environmentAt TikTok, we work to design tools and policies that promote a safe and age-appropriate experience for teens 13-17. For example, when younger teens start using TikTok, we intentionally restrict access to some features, such as LIVE and Direct Messaging, and automatically set accounts of users ages 13-15 to private by default. These are deliberate decisions we've taken to protect younger members of the community as they start to build their online presence. We also aim to provide parents with resources they can use to have conversations about digital safety and decide the most comfortable experience for their family, including our Family Pairing features and our new Guardian's Guide to TikTok.We take our responsibility to protect our community incredibly seriously. It is the most important work we do, and we will continue to innovate to keep our community safe. We look forward to sharing more about our work in the future.

Keeping teens educated and safe requires collaboration among parents, experts, governments, and platforms. In that spirit, today we're rolling out our refreshed Safety Center with new guides and resources aimed at supporting digital safety and security conversations among families. Our goal is to make it easy for parents to understand how TikTok works and the tools they can use to create the best experience for their family.A Guardian's Guide to TikTokAs we work to support families on our platform, we're introducing the Guardian's Guide, a one-stop-shop to learn all about TikTok. This includes how to get started on the platform, our safety and privacy tools, such as our Family Pairing features, and additional resources to address common online safety questions. We understand that every teen and family is different, which is why we offer a range of choices and settings to empower parents and caregivers who are looking for easy ways to engage in their teen's life online.Bullying education and prevention resourcesTikTok is a global community that thrives on creativity and expression, and it's critical that people feel safe to express themselves without fear of bullying or harassment. To educate families and the broader TikTok community on ways to protect against the harms of online bullying, we've developed a bullying prevention guide in partnership with a range of experts, including the Cyberbullying Research Center, Net Family News, and TikTok's US Content Advisory Council. The guide offers information to help people identify bullying, tools to combat harrassment, and local resources to get help if someone is being bullied.Videos on our approach to platform safetyOur approach to safety spans policies, products, and partners as we build a community where creativity and creative expression can thrive. Our Safety Center now offers parents and guardians a look into our safety ecosystem through new videos on how we approach safety, our Community Guidelines, and resources available to them.Information about our work with expertsWe are at our strongest when we work together, which is why we've developed important relationships with leading safety experts. The updated Safety Center connects our community to information about TikTok and resources on a range of topics, such as media literacy and digital well-being, which we developed with experts at organizations including the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE), the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA), Connect Safely, the Family Online Safety Institute, and the National PTA, among others.Our Safety Center is an important part of how we can support families on TikTok. That's why we make it accessible to everyone directly from their settings and other parts of our app. We continue to invest in new ways to maintain a safe and welcoming platform and are committed to earning the trust of our TikTok community every time they open the app. For more information, check out our Safety Center."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-yayayayoung","date":"2021-05-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @yayayayoung","text":"At TikTok, we love cultivating an environment where creators can mesh their passions for entertainment and education together to make amazing content for their community.

Community safety is our top priority, and we place utmost care on the safety of our teenage users in particular. Our membership reflects both TikTok’s zero tolerance of child sexual exploitation and that this global challenge requires a collective response.Partnering with expertsWe're at our strongest when we work together, which is why we're proud to join the Technology Coalition. Through this membership, we hope to deepen our evidence-based approach to intervention and contribute our unique learnings from addressing child safety and exploitation. TikTok is also joining the board of the Technology Coalition along with a number of committees that aim to advance protections for children online and off and drive greater transparency of evolving threats to child safety.This membership builds on previous partnerships with leading online safety organizations, including the Family Online Safety Institute, ConnectSafely, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), WePROTECT Global Alliance, DQ Institute, and the Internet Watch Foundation to help ensure that our policies and features continue to promote a safe and welcoming environment for our community. TikTok has also endorsed the implementation of the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in an effort to ensure a consistent and strong response to exploitation across services.Protecting against exploitationAt TikTok, we are deeply committed to the safety of teens on our platform. We do not tolerate content or behavior that perpetuates the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors, as outlined in our Community Guidelines. If we become aware of any such content, we will take immediate action to remove content, terminate accounts, and report cases to NCMEC and law enforcement, as appropriate.Building for youth safetyTikTok is where people come to express themselves creatively, build a community, and explore new ideas. While our creative community includes teens and grandparents alike, we work to design age-appropriate experiences for those ages 13-17. We offer a number of safeguards to support teens as they begin their digital journey. For instance, accounts of users ages 13-15 are set to private by default, and only people 16 and over can use direct messaging and live stream.Additionally, we believe it's important to engage parents and caregivers in digital safety conversations. That's why TikTok offers tools, like our Family Pairing features, which aim to encourage conversations among parents, caregivers, and teens as they decide the browsing and privacy settings that are best for their family. Through Family Pairing, parents and guardians can link their TikTok account to their teen's to enable a variety of content and privacy settings, such as screen time management and search settings. TikTok's Safety Center For Parents provides more information on the resources and controls that are available to families.There is no finish line when it comes to protecting the TikTok community. We work each day to learn, adapt, and strengthen our policies and practices to keep our community safe, and we look forward to building on all of these efforts through our partnership with the Technology Coalition."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-onlinekyne","date":"2021-05-04T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @Onlinekyne","text":"At TikTok, we are always looking for opportunities to highlight amazing creators on our platform.

They are the CEO, marketing strategist and operations mastermind all wrapped into one. They are dreamers, risk-takers and doers. And since last March, they've become champions, overcoming a challenge like no other: a global pandemic that also impacted so many of our local communities and businesses. This is National Small Business Week, and at TikTok, we're recognizing the impact of small businesses all month long. Like many of you, we consider small businesses to be a critical part of our community — both on TikTok and beyond, and we're committed to helping them bounce back after a challenging year. Last summer, we gave small businesses $100 million in ad credits and launched TikTok for Business to help them connect with communities and thrive. Since then, we've seen small businesses — like Artesana Soaps in Camden, AR and Siders Woodcrafting in Brewer, ME — create joyful, authentic short videos that reach people down the street and around the world. Others, such as Pinole Blue in Wichita, Kansas and Hello Sweets in Upstate New York, have sold out their inventory with a single TikTok. All during a time when many of us sheltered in place and hoped for relief.Small businesses continue to be an important part of the TikTok community — from giving people a fun way to review of their favorite sandwich shop to helping shoppers discover black-owned and women-owned businesses. We're excited to celebrate the businesses that bring vibrance to both our local communities and the TikTok community!#SupportSmallBusinesses: bringing our communities togetherThroughout the month of May, the TikTok community can discover and show some love for their favorite small business using #SupportSmallBusiness. Business owners can also share their experience and give us a peek into their world. From packing orders and behind-the-scenes tutorials to business advice and motivation for the tough times, we are excited to see more business owners and their supporters interact with each other on TikTok. Helping small businesses reach local customersToday, working with Nielsen, we are giving business owners the ability to tailor their paid ad campaigns on TikTok to specific Designated Market Areas. This means that small business owners can localize their advertising so that they are reaching the people who matter most to them.Catch us on ClubHouseWe're hosting a four-part series on ClubHouse with our new official TikTok for Business Club. The conversations will take place every Friday throughout May at 11:00 am EST, and they will give small business owners across the country the chance to learn how to get started on TikTok, find their communities and thrive. The first conversation, From Main Street to Mainstreaming will feature four small business owners: Marlene Robinson of Mrs. Robinson's Tea in Kennett Square, PA, Tina Sapia of Sapia's Barber Shop in Clearwater, FL, Javier Juarez of Jay's Fresh Pressed Lemonade in Parlier, CA, and Glenn Poole of Izola's Country Cooking in Hinesville, GA. We hope you can join the conversation!Celebrating Small Businesses All Year LongThere's no doubt that small businesses enrich our lives. They are the coffee shop where you sit with your dog, the burgeoning artist who created your favorite t-shirt, and the woodworker who made your kitchen table. We're thankful for everything they give us, and we're proud to celebrate them this and every month. We hope you join us in celebrating small businesses — and don't forget to share your latest #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt haul in their honor."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/ten-standout-teachers-on-tiktok","date":"2021-05-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Ten standout teachers on TikTok","text":"Today kicks off National Teacher Appreciation Week, and there’s no better time to honor and celebrate educators across America. From teaching remotely to managing the logistics of hybrid learning, the pandemic has brought no shortage of challenges to teachers. Along the way, more teachers have turned to TikTok to share laughs, inspire other educators and parents, and showcase their creativity, like taking virtual field trips to the zoo, providing lessons on Black history, and sharing tips to help caregivers teach at home.This Teacher Appreciation Week, we're thrilled to spotlight 10 standout teachers from the TikTok community. Through their creativity and passion for teaching, these educators remind us just how fun learning can be. To show our appreciation for these often unsung heroes, we’re awarding each standout teacher $5,000 to use towards their virtual or in-person classrooms and students. And we're encouraging all teachers to share their stories with the TikTok community this week using #TeachersOnTikTok.“Teachers play an incredibly important but often undervalued role in our society. They are constantly innovating and adapting, using their own personal resources to enable students to feel seen and heard. We are thrilled to show a small gesture of appreciation towards these educational creators who use TikTok to connect with their students and families in a creative way so that learning continues to be fun no matter the circumstances.” - Stephanie Hind, Manager, Creator Management and Operations, TikTokTrying new and creative ideas is part of what makes TikTok a fun and supportive place to learn and grow.

Just a few months later, Claudine had over 1.6M followers from 82 different countries. Her followers include ESL learners who mastered basic grammar skills needed for language acquisition, some who needed academic refreshers, and others who use her content to study for various tests. From sharing the difference of ‘your’ and ‘you’re’ to practicing synonyms, Claudine’s videos and stories motivate and inspire other teachers.

Her video demonstrating how cocoa powder is hydrophobic went viral with 12.2M views. Nancy says her students always talk about how they tried one of her TikTok experiments at home with their parents, which makes her proud.@fancynancyin5th - Nancy is a veteran 4th and 5th grade teacher in Irvine, California.

Last year, she was invited to join TikTok’s Creative Learning Fund to continue contributing to the teacher community through the #LearnOnTikTok platform.@spanishforeveryday - Nibaldo teaches Spanish to Kindergarteners through 6th graders in Louisville, Kentucky, but his TikTok videos are reaching millions of people across the world who want to learn Spanish.

We’re committed to fostering an inclusive app environment, and that means building products and tools that support our diverse community. As we continue working to make TikTok ever more accessible, today we’re introducing auto captions, a new feature to help people who are hard of hearing or deaf better use and enjoy TikTok.How auto captions workAuto captions automatically generate subtitles, allowing viewers to read or listen to content. As creators make content, they can select auto captions in the editing page after they've uploaded or recorded a video so that text is automatically transcribed and displayed on their videos.With this feature, creators have the power to edit the text of their captions once they're generated.Captions added by creators are part of the video content, and in the event a viewer wants to turn them off they can do so by opening the share panel, tapping the captions button, and setting captions to off.This feature will initially be available in American English and Japanese, with additional language support in the coming months. We are working with our community to spread the word and encourage all creators to use auto captions and other features that make content more accessible.Investing in accessibilityAuto captions builds on a number of features we've developed to make TikTok more accessible to everyone. Given the visual nature of our platform, we've designed a number of improvements, starting with features that help those with visual impairments. To date, our work on accessibility includes:An animated thumbnail that replaces animated thumbnails with static images.A creator warning that notifies creators when they produce videos with effects that could trigger photosensitive epilepsy.A photosensitivity feature allows users to skip photosensitive content, which can be harmful for people with epilepsy.A text-to-speech feature which converts text to voice.Our goal at TikTok is to be accessible to all people, and we're committed to doing the work long-term. We're currently undertaking an accessibility assessment to identify additional areas for improvement, and we're increasing our outreach to organizations and communities with disabilities on TikTok to uplift their voices and make changes that better serve us all. By working with organizations like The Deaf Collective, we aim to increase awareness towards the range of diversity, talent, and conversations being had in Deaf communities.As we advance this work, we'll continue to share news and updates with our community in an effort to be transparent and share the progress made.

We've been working with experts to improve our understanding of sexual assault and trauma and how to foster a safe and supportive space for survivors. Now, we're rolling out new resources we developed with guidance from experts at RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network). Our goal is to make access to support readily available to anyone in need and educate the broader community on this important issue.Providing resources for our communityFor survivors who want to share their story, it's important that they're able to do so without fear of abuse or alienation. To help create a welcoming environment we're working to connect our community to expert-backed support materials. We've partnered with RAINN to develop educational content for this month within our Discover page, where people can learn about sexual violence, prevention, and healing.This year's theme for Sexual Assault Awareness Month — We Can Build Safe Online Spaces — is one that especially resonates with us. As a global platform, we continue to think about the measures we can take to keep TikTok a space where survivors can find support and community. That's why on our Discover page all month long you can find tips for supporting survivors and access to the National Sexual Assault Hotline (800-656-HOPE or online.rainn.org).Building safe online spaces requires understanding where the conversations are taking place and meeting survivors where they are. As such, we've introduced permanent public service announcements on hashtags, such as #consentmatters and others, to both foster supportive conversations and connect our community to help resources on our Safety Center.“We are proud to be partnering with TikTok to educate more people on the realities of sexual violence and provide resources. As people look to platforms like TikTok to receive and share information, it is more important than ever that the content is reliable and not harmful. We’re excited for the opportunity to share our resources with a global audience and to help TikTok remain a safe and positive platform for people to have these critical conversations.” - Heather Drevna, Vice President of Communications, RAINNBuilding for safetyIn the coming months, we'll be rolling out additional permanent resources to help survivors looking for confidential help, information, and services in our app.As a reminder, TikTok strictly prohibits content depicting or supporting sexual violence, including non-consensual intimate imagery, hacked imagery, and any attempt to glorify rape and sexual assault. Another step we've recently taken is refreshing our policies to better create space for survivors to share their story or find community, without fear of further harassment. In order to do that, we strive to consistently and equitably enforce our policies against content that exploits sexual violence or accounts that engage in harassing behaviors.As we continue to work with experts and evolve our approach to providing community resources, our hope is to uplift survivors and help build a culture in which there are fewer victims, not just in April but every month of the year."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/celebrating-arab-tiktok","date":"2021-03-31T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Celebrating #ArabTikTok","text":"Every year in April, the U.S. recognizes Arab Heritage Month to celebrate and elevate the rich contributions, heritage, and culture of the Arab American community.

Since November, our teams have removed 85.3% of this kind of content before it received a single view. Our Advertising Policies also make it clear that we prohibit the advertising of products derived from protected animals or the sale of animals themselves.We know that the criminals who facilitate wildlife trafficking constantly change their tactics to evade detection that makes this kind of partnership essential. Working with the Coalition will enable the sharing of best practices within industry, support the monitoring of emerging developments, and give us the opportunity to hear honest feedback that helps us to continue to improve.“The scale of wildlife trafficking online is very challenging to quantify given its illegal nature, but we know that online platforms like TikTok are essential to the solution.

Employees in the US and EU were encouraged to embrace our unique values, including being grounded and courageous to transform visionary ideas into reality. Kicking off our first Hackathon is one of many ways we're fostering an agile culture of engineering to inspire creativity and bring joy to TikTok's global community. The prototypes that originate from events like Hackathons often fuel the creation of user focused features in unforeseen ways.In under 48 hours, over 120 participants from across TikTok generated 32 standout ideas that were then presented as part of a company-wide showcase. Teams were made up of various fields, with multiple interests and skills, all collaborating to achieve a common goal. Top submissions won awards and prizes, and some of the most outstanding ones were even considered for future product integrations to shape the TikTok experience.A panel of peer judges spanning across our product, operations, engineering, security, and design teams were charged with evaluating projects based on three key criteria:Completeness - how close is the prototype to being ready for demo and launch?Innovation - has something like this been done before, or is this revolutionary?Product value - does this \"hack\" meaningfully address user pain points and generate excitement from our community?The Hackathon surfaced dozens of innovative ideas and imaginative solutions that are bound to have a lasting impact on product development at TikTok.

Multiple songs from Future Nostalgia caught fire on TikTok, including “Don’t Start Now” (3.7 million creations), which trended in January 2020 after TikTok user @isaac_tuazon posted a video about avoiding people at the mall, incidentally spurring the “Full 180” challenge (3.2 billion views on the #Full180 hashtag). Dua trended once again later in the year after partnering with TikTok to create the #DuaVideo challenge, asking TikTok users to make creative videos to the tune of her Future Nostalgia single “Levitating,” offering a creative role in the song’s music video to the creators with the best submissions. Released October 2nd, the “Levitating” video featured a wealth of TikTok talent, including Dexter Mayfield and Kendra \"K.O\" Oyesanya as members of Dua's dancing team, and Ana Coto and Coco Franklin as Roller Girls. Harry Styles: Harry Styles had a massive year and 2020, and TikTok played a big role in the success of his song “Watermelon Sugar,” which won the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance. The candy-coated “Watermelon Sugar” provided the ideal summer vibe for TikTok users, inspiring over 1.3 million video creations and helping sustain a long top 20 run for the song on the Billboard Hot 100–including a one-week rise to #1. TikTok has become a major base of operations for Harry’s legion of loyal fans, with fan-created pages updating the community on his every move and creating Harry-themed content of their own. Harry’s team highlighted some of his favorite “Watermelon Sugar” creations on his official TikTok account, including a Disney-themed TikTok that garnered over 12 million views and drew the attention of Guardians Of The Galaxy director James Gunn. Congratulations once again to these incredible artists and all the other Grammy Award winners, performers, and nominees!"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-dadlifejason","date":"2021-03-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @dadlifejason","text":"TikTok has become a home for creators to celebrate their talents and share their love for their community and family. Through our Creator Spotlight Series, an ongoing series highlighting amazing creatives, we get to showcase some of the standout talent we see doing this on the platform each day.Next up in the series is @dadlifejason. As the patriarch of a multiracial family, he uses his platform to share family moments and experiences. For Jason, it's important to show the love and tenderness of fatherhood and parenting in the Black community. From singing popular songs with his children through his Talk Box to sharing the heartwarming interactions he has with his family, Jason shows all the positive moments he has as a parent and brings joy to everyone who watches his videos. Check out more from Jason below, where he shares his advice for new creators and discussed what drives him to create heartwarming content each day!How did you get started creating on TikTok, and what was the first TikTok video you shared/published?I first got started on TikTok about two years ago, just trying to understand the lingo of the students I was working with as a special education teacher’s aide.Why do you think TikTok is the right platform for your content or why do you continue to create and share on TikTok?TikTok is the right platform for me because it helps me find my audience. It also helps my audience find me and share the positivity.What is your favorite TikTok you have made to date and why?My favorite TikTok that I’ve made so far is the one where I sing “before you go” with my daughter falling asleep in my arms because millions of people connected with us in that tender moment. What lights a fire in you?What lights a fire in me is seeing people become a community when they are perfect strangers otherwise. They have been able to find things within each other that are so common that they see themselves in each other and can come together and become almost a family. Right here on TikTok, I have seen it happen so many times. We find our audience. That lights a fire in me because there are people out there that want to know about me, that want to see what I can do. And there are people out there that I want to see and I want to be inspired by and it's great that this can happen here on TikTok.Any advice for new creators?My advice is to be consistent and positive in what you do. Have grace for yourself as you share your authentic self. Your audience will find you.What does being a Trailblazer mean to you?Being a Trailblazer means being intentional and moving with the purpose of adding value and displaying the worth of the culture that we are a part of. It means to embody positive progress.Who are some Black creators that everyone should be following/watching?When I think about Black creators on TikTok that everyone should be watching and looking out for, I have a couple of names. @kentai.haven is a creator that uses measurements and mathematics to try and figure out people's heights and the speed that things are going. To see him operating on a Tony Stark level of genius, it inspires not only me but the younger ones coming up that, hey, it's not just school and math on a paper – you can actually solve real world problems with your STEM skills and he is showing that in spades. He is amazing, and one day I hope he can guess my height. The next person is @wisdm8, his fashion sense from thrifting all the way to high end fashion has been excellent all the way across. It is really inspiring to see somebody crack open a closet and try to find fashion that relates to an emoji, and he does it and I'm like \"gosh, I want to look that good one day!\" I can see him dressing the stars in the near future. The last one is not so much a large creator, her name is @ourmatchedhearts, just to see her journey through foster care and adoption has been really inspiring. The softness of her heart towards the children and the softness of her heart as she responds to people asking the questions that they ask is really inspiring. It helps me to know that when people ask me questions, I need to respond in the kindest possible manner because people are just curious and want to know."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-sugar-crashes-the-top-sounds","date":"2021-03-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: Sugar crashes the top sounds","text":"TikTok creators document the challenges from the recent US #SnowStorm!

From cooking outdoors, to daily diaries, and crucial tips for saving energy, the TikTok community was extremely reactive to these recent weather anomalies.The severe weather marked a moment where the TikTok community was able to act as citizen journalists and share their experiences on-the-ground. Given the concentrated nature of the weather, and the way in which Texas became disconnected for several days, TikTok provided a distinct perspective on the reality of the situation. TikTok users were able to give insight into their unique experiences: their struggles, their perseverance, and their perspective.Similar to the way in which content related to the Presidential Inauguration gained prominence in-app, this reactive form of content creation continues to grow. Perhaps more importantly though, TikTok is providing an outlet for users to give deeper insight and create a human connection to moments that often get lost in the traditional news cycle.

To help foster kindness in our community, today we're rolling out two new features: the first feature gives creators more control over the comments on their videos, and the second prompts people to reconsider posting unkind or inappropriate comments.More power to control commentsCreators put their heart and soul into creating content millions of people love, and we're working to provide even more control over their content. With our new Filter All Comments feature, creators can decide which comments will appear on their videos. When enabled, comments aren't displayed unless the video's creator approves them using the new comment management tool.This feature builds on our existing collection of comment controls that allow people to filter spam and offensive comments, and specific keywords.

The development behind the video is a strenuous process, but when it's all condensed into a one minute video it's fast-paced and exciting.What is your favorite TikTok you have made to date and why?My sapnap pt 2 video – it was really fun to make and the energy and everything was in sync. I also really enjoyed the video on pahari, it was very highly anticipated. What lights a fire in you?Something that lights a fire in me is seeing people appreciate the time I put in crafting my videos. Knowing that I've left a positive impact on someone else's life really motivates me to continue creating more interesting and innovative content.Any advice for new creators?Maximize the effort you put into a video. If it feels bland, put a little more time into it. Secondly, if your video blows up randomly, you need to analyze what elements of that video caused it to go viral.What does being a Trailblazer mean to you?Being a trailblazer means I'm a selected representative of my community through my content.

Take a deeper look at the content with this new feature in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects.Current Top Trend: #DramaticMomentsThere are few things more satisfying than a snappy retort and the recent #DramaticMoments trend showcases comebacks with a dramatic flair.Using the BGC Drama Effect sound as the backbone for this trend, creators start the video with a blanket statement before the dramatic music chimes in and they switch characters to respond to the initial statement. With a focus on relatable situations and hilarious characters, #DramaticMoments is a simple, effective format that can be used to create content in any location for any subject. It's been used to cover an eclectic variety of topics such as wearing makeup, sharing songs with friends, and interacting with parents among countless others.#DramaticMoments highlights how comedic formats can be used across a variety of communities to unite different types of users and creators under a single trend. Notable Video Hot Track: FallingWhen Trevor Daniel created \"Falling\" back in 2018 he made a song that immediately struck at the heart of everyone who hears it. Since its creation, \"Falling\" has become a go to sound yet again for creators who want to tell an emotional story or add a heart to their video. When it begins playing, the viewer already knows what kind of video they are about to watch, making it one of the most used sounds on TikTok. Hot Effect: BlinkBlink puts the viewer in the POV of someone waking up. Creators have utilized this effect to make hilarious content showing what it might be like to wake up as their significant other. Creator Spotlight: @quenwilliamssQuen is a professional real estate agent who is using her platform to help make home buying attainable for the Black community. She didn't see much Black representation in the real estate industry and hardly any representation of home ownership in Black households and wants to change that. She hopes her content will help more people of color own a home and create generational wealth.

We work to maintain an environment where everyone feels safe to create, find community, and be entertained. We are committed to being transparent about how we keep our platform safe, because it helps build trust and understanding with our community. Today, we're taking another step to be accountable to this commitment by releasing our fourth global Transparency Report.This Transparency Report covers the second half of 2020 (July 1 - December 31) and provides visibility into the volume and nature of content removed for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, with additional insight into our work to counter misinformation related to COVID-19 and elections. It also includes how we respond to law enforcement requests for information, government requests for content removals, and intellectual property removal requests.We've added a number of new data to this report in our effort to be ever more transparent, including:Accounts removedSpam accounts and videos removedVideos restored after they were appealed by the video's creatorSpecific policy insightsAds rejected for violating our advertising policiesHere are some of the key insights from the report, which you can read in full here.Community Guidelines enforcement overview89,132,938 videos were removed globally in the second half of 2020 for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, which is less than 1% of all videos uploaded on TikTok. Of these videos, 11,775,777 were removed in the US. 92.4% of these videos were removed before a user reported them, 83.3% were removed before they received any views, and 93.5% were removed within 24 hours of being posted.6,144,040 accounts were removed for violating our Community Guidelines.9,499,881 spam accounts were removed along with 5,225,800 spam videos posted by those accounts. We prevented 173,246,894 accounts from being created through automated means.3,501,477 ads were rejected for violating advertising policies and guidelines.Countering COVID-19 and vaccine misinformationTikTok continues to work with public health experts to help our community stay safe and informed on COVID-19 and vaccines. We make public health information available throughout our app as we also work to counter misinformation. Here are some results from these efforts during the second half of 2020:Our COVID-19 information hub was viewed 2,625,049,193 times.Banners directing viewers to the COVID-19 information hub were added to 3,065,213 videos.Public service announcements (PSAs) on hashtags directing users to the WHO and local public health resources were viewed 38,010,670,666 times.51,505 videos were removed for promoting COVID-19 misinformation. Of these videos, 86% were removed before they were reported to us, 87% were removed within 24 hours of being uploaded to TikTok, and 71% had zero views.Maintaining platform integrity through the US 2020 electionsThough political videos make up a smaller amount of overall content on TikTok, and we don't accept paid political ads, we work to keep TikTok free of election misinformation while also providing access to authoritative information about civic processes. In the second half of 2020, we worked to safeguard the integrity of elections globally.In the US, our team of safety, security, policy, and operations experts work each day to detect and stop the spread of election misinformation and other content that violates our Community Guidelines. Our teams are supported by automated technology that identifies and flags content for review as well as industry-leading threat intelligence platforms that escalate content emerging across the internet and on our platform. Here are some of the results from this work in the last half of 2020:Our 2020 US elections guide with authoritative information about voting, the elections, and results was visited 17,995,580 times.PSAs on election-related hashtags reminded people to follow our Community Guidelines, verify information, and report content, and were viewed 73,776,375,496 times.As the majority of content people see on TikTok comes through their For You feed (which recommends videos regardless of when they were posted) banners were added on 6,978,395 election-related videos that directed viewers to the elections guide for up-to-date information and results.347,225 videos were removed in the US for election misinformation, disinformation, or manipulated media.We work with fact checkers to help us verify the accuracy of content and limit distribution of unsubstantiated content. As a result, 441,028 videos were not eligible for recommendation into anyone's For You feed.What we think workedOur proportionate focus on both foreign and domestic threats to our platform and overall elections integrity during the US 2020 elections was the right approach. We started our elections preparations in 2019 and built defenses based on industry learnings from the US 2016 elections, but we also prepared for more domestic activity based on trends we've observed on how misleading content is created and spread online.We made the correct tooling investments that allowed us to quickly and meaningfully reduce the discoverability of disinformation and terms of incitement. We moved to quickly redirect misleading hashtags to our Community Guidelines instead of showing results, such as #sharpiegate #stopthesteal #patriotparty. This approach has also helped us combat QAnon content, though we continually must update our safeguards as content and terminology evolves.Prioritizing faster turnaround times for fact-checking helped us make informed and quick decisions on emerging content.Our investment in building relationships with a range of experts improved our overall approach to platform integrity, from policies to enforcement strategies to product experiences in our app.What we can improveWe will keep improving our systems to proactively detect and flag misleading content for review. For instance, we can immediately detect known disinformation using our disinformation hashbank, and we're working to advance our models so that we can better identify altered versions of known disinformation.We will continue to develop our system that prevents repeat offenders from circumventing our enforcement decisions.More investment is needed to educate creators and brands on disclosure requirements for paid influencer content. TikTok does not allow paid political ads, and that includes content influencers are paid to create, and we expect our community to abide by our policies and FTC guidelines.We were proud of the in-app elections guide we developed with experts, and in the future we would launch it sooner in the elections process.US legal requestsHere's a look at legal requests we received in the US during the second half of 2020. The report provides additional insight into the volume of legal requests received globally.We received 546 legal requests for information in the US and evaluated:228 subpoenas (when a US governmental entity issues a subpoena, we may disclose user data that includes basic subscriber information)169 search warrants (when a US governmental entity obtains a search warrant, we may disclose user data that includes video content and user interactions)11 court orders (when a US governmental entity obtains a court order, we may disclose user data that includes log data)1 pen register/trap trace (PRTT) (when a US governmental entity obtains a PRTT, we may disclose user data that includes log data)137 emergency disclosure requestsWe received 5 requests from US government agencies to restrict or remove content.This is our most comprehensive report to-date, and we're proud of the progress we've made to increase transparency into our content and moderation practices. We'll continue to listen to feedback from our community and share our progress as we work to earn the trust of our community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-alexisnikole","date":"2021-02-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @alexisnikole","text":"TikTok is a home for creators to share their passions with others and grow a community around their interests. Through our Creator Spotlight Series, an ongoing feature series highlighting our inspiring creatives, we're able to showcase these amazing creators teaching others and sharing a part of their world on the platform each day.Next up in the series is @alexisnikole, a creator sharing her knowledge and passion for foraging, a practice of searching for food resources in the wild. Alexis uses her channel to detail how foraging is important to her culture, as well as simple tips and tricks for finding edible plants and cooking what she finds, all with a lighthearted and comedic lens. Read more below from Alexis in her own words about her journey on TikTok, her passion for the outdoors, and her favorite Black creators!How did you get started creating on TikTok, and what was the first TikTok video you shared/published?I started my account in early 2020 to get a better feel for the app, since I'm a social media manager for BarkBox by day, and we wanted to expand onto the platform. Oh gosh, my first video was some short little thing about my messed up sleep schedule! I was still compartmentalizing my content at the time, and had NO CLUE what was going to happen when I finally combined my love of comedy, storytelling, cooking, and PLANTS.Why do you think TikTok is the right platform for your content or why do you continue to create and share on TikTok?TikTok gives you some of the best tools for creating engaging bits of content, while also giving you the chance to grow quickly! You're not beholden to only your followers, and on other apps it can feel like you have to focus more on chasing new eyes, instead of focusing on the content!What is your favorite TikTok you have made to date and why?My Poison Hemlock vs Queen Anne's Lace comparison! For starters OH MY GOD EVERYONE SHOULD LEARN THIS. There were HUNDREDS of comments from folks who had confused the two in the past (someone even put poison hemlock in their wedding bouquet 😭). In a CLOSE SECOND, was my seaweed dessert vid, which involved the most research, and was a fun experiment in my kitchen that I got to share with the world! and THE JIGGLE hahaha. What lights a fire in you?What lights a fire in me is accessibility of knowledge, especially to those who dont think that the knowledge is for them and don't think that it's something that they are able to learn. I love giving the Black communtiy in particular the knowledge that outdoor spaces are accessibile for us and they are just as much for us as they are for everyone else.Any advice for new creators?Don't compartmentalize yourself. Bring your whole self to your content, and it will resonate! I spent years keeping my love of plants separate from my love of comedy separate from my love of fashion and makeup separate from my love of academics and when I finally let all those pieces of myself come together, they made a complete puzzle.What does being a Trailblazer mean to you?Being a trailblazer means that I get the opportunity to show people, especially Black folx, we can be outdoorsy! We can be nerdy! We can flaunt so many different sides of ourselves, and it doesn't detract AT ALL from our blackness. If I help just one person who comes across my content feel more comfortable in their skin, I've done the job I set out to do.Who are some Black creators that everyone should be following/watching?The first Black creator everyone should be following is @inyonifelix. She is an amazing afro-indigeous creator who has taught me so much about California indigenous culture. Another is @rynnstar – she's so smart, so funny, so patient, I love her so much. And third is @ladyyasmina1 who just makes the funniest and most relateable, in that way that you really didn't think would be relatable."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/meet-the-first-100-black-creators-and-music-artists-joining-the-tiktok-for-black-creatives-program","date":"2021-02-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Meet the first 100 Black creators and music artists joining the TikTok for Black Creatives program","text":"Today we are proud to introduce you to the 100 Black creators and emerging music artists who will be joining our three month creator incubator program, TikTok for Black Creatives.

Built primarily around a remix of tracks from Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West, #AlbumCover proved that truly anything can be an album cover.The concept was extremely straightforward: users shared video footage (typically from their camera roll), before freezing on a specific frame and then cutting to the same frame fitted to an album cover with a fictional title. While the trend initially started with college-aged users sharing moments with friends, the flexibility of the format meant that it could be applied to any interests or content genres. Within days from the initial set of videos, users from all of TikTok's communities developed their own unique versions of the #AlbumCover trend, ranging from filmmakers to pop culture fans and even some favorite sports organizations. Whether it was a photo from a historic moment, or just a personal snapshot from friends, the trend gained steamed by showcasing how even the subtlest moments can be incredible when given the right spotlight.Incredible TikTok moments come when communities find ways to interact with one another across a wide spectrum of different interests. And moments where users can create videos based on footage they've already captured are fantastic at drawing content from a diverse group of creators.

She inspires and is all about peace, forgiveness, and love. She is a queen!Any advice for new creators?My advice to new creators would be to choose a niche, and focus on creating content with value rather than obsessing to go viral. Chances are you will have videos go viral if you stay true to yourself and create content that truly inspires you.What does being a Trailblazer mean to you?Being a trailblazer to me means paving a path for others that leads to places few have travelled.

For Black History Month, Leon connects with fellow Fort Worth resident Keite Young to premiere an impassioned cover of “Like A Ship,” a beloved under-heard 1971 gospel/soul hybrid gem by Pastor T.L. Barrett. Marked by ecstatic choirs and swelling organ, Leon’s version of “Like A Ship” is both a faithful interpretation of the original and of a piece with the rest of Leon’s R&B catalogue, illustrating how Black music’s spiritual roots continue to permeate popular culture.A producer and artist who bubbled up from the Montreal electronic music underground, KAYTRANADA lives on the cutting edge. TikTok and KAYTRANADA are proud to premiere “Caution,” a brand new original song that seamlessly blends funk, disco, and house into a futuristic mix. Layering syncopated kicks, splashy snares, and energetic vocal samples, “Caution” explores another hotspot of Black music innovation: the blockparty.Together, the two songs by Leon Bridges and KAYTRANADA point to an illustrious history of Black music, while paving a path forward for both traditional and boundary-pushing sounds. Both songs will be available first as TikTok sounds, and will be released to DSPs later this month.Your Favorite Artists LIVEDuring Black History Month, we’ve made it our mission to amplify Black voices.

To honor the history of Black music, our music team put together “Make Black Music,” a series of themed playlists that highlight a particular genre, era, or quality that makes Black music special. As the month progresses, the theme of the playlists shift from past (playlists highlighting Motown, rap classics, rock ‘n roll origins, and more), to present (featuring hip-hop hits, pop icons, and Afrobeats), to a glimpse of the future (house & electronic, hip-hop newcomers, future soul). The month concludes with a series of playlists celebrating the Joy of Black music. The “Make Black Music” playlists can be found on the “Discover” page and on the “Sounds” page.TikTok LIVE Make Black History CelebrationOur month-long celebration ends on a high note by celebrating artists that represent the past, present, and future of West Coast Hip Hop.

Through our Creator Spotlight Series, ongoing features highlighting our trendsetting creatives, we're able to showcase these amazing creators teaching others on the platform each day.Next up in the series is @quenwilliamss, a full time real estate agent and creator using her platform to make home-buying attainable for the Black community, by demystifying the home ownership process and teaching viewers what it's like to work in her field as a Black real estate agent. Quen's goal of making home ownership easy to understand and attainable for all her viewers shines though in every video, and her passion for helping others is always inspiring and uplifting. Read more below from Quen in her own words about her professional journey and inspiration, her time on TikTok, and her favorite Black creators!How did you get started creating on TikTok, and what was the first TikTok video you shared/published?I scrolled through TikTok for at least a whole year before I made my first post. I posted my very first video shortly after the death of George Floyd. I was expressing my confusion about how police in America can be so wreckless with the lives of American citizens, and how there's no accountability. When I was in the Army, deployed to Iraq, there was more accountability for American soldiers' actions against foreign enemies than there are for American police against American citizens.Why do you think TikTok is the right platform for your content or why do you continue to create and share on TikTok?TikTok is perfect because it's short-form and it makes it so easy for people to engage with the content on the platform.What is your favorite TikTok you have made to date and why?My favorite TikTok would have to be when I hit my two-year mark in real estate. I was celebrating the fact that I'd closed almost 100 homes at the time as a young, Black and relatively new agent. What made the video stand out most was the outpouring of support. This was my most viral video at the time, so I had millions of people celebrating with me! I don't think that could have happened anywhere else but TikTok. What lights a fire in you?What lights a fire in me is helping people. Ever since I was little I wanted to help people, I wanted to be a doctor or a psychologist. I ended up being a medic in the Army for about 12 years and was able to help people that way. And now as a real estate agent – and especially because I have a platform on TikTok – I'm able to help so many more people than I could have ever, ever imagined.What Black historical figure inspires you?The person who has inspired me my whole life and has had such a big influence on me is Madam CJ Walker. I remember I had to do a project on her when I was in elementary school and the moment that I learned her story I was enamored. I was obsessed. I admired her so much because she pulled herself up by the bootstraps when she didn't even have boots to begin with. She's the very first Black American woman to be a self-made millionaire so now whenever I encounter obstacles or I feel discouraged, I think about how Madam CJ Walker did it. And she did it with way less privilege and way fewer resoruces than I have—so if she can do it then I can do it and I have no excuses.Any advice for new creators?Be authentically you. Create content you like. Don't create to try to go viral. If you stay true to yourself, your people will find you.What does being a Trailblazer mean to you?Being a Trailblazer means I'm blazing the path for the next Black TikTok creator. If one of us shines, we all shine.Who are some Black creators that everyone should be following/watching?There are quite a few Black creators that I love to watch on TikTok. Here are a few that I love because they are multifaceted:First up is @rynnstar, she does videos about linguistics and also talks about racial equity and justice.I love @mayaechols. Not only is she a beautiful model (she's literally a model) but she also does these really good deep dives into Black history and stereotypes about the Black community.I love @crutches_and_spice because she not only talks about being a Black woman but also the intersectionality of being a Black woman with disabilities."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-spotlight-series-veondre","date":"2021-02-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Creator Spotlight Series: @veondre","text":"At TikTok, we value creators for being their authentic selves on the platform and aim to create a space where everyone feels confident to live their best life.

Take a deeper look at the content with this new feature in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects.Current Top Trend: The Resurgence of Pop PunkThis week, we're taking a step back to focus on how nostalgia is driving renewed interest in a music genre that r​esonates with audiences both young and old.TikTok's soft spot for alternative rock, specifically pop punk from the early to mid-2000's, has become apparent over the last few weeks. Many of the tracks surging in-app first came to prominence in the mid-2000s, coinciding with the teenage years of users who would now be in their mid twenties to early thirties. And with the outside world a tad difficult at the moment, nostalgic songs from our past can function as reminders of simpler times, or even make us feel younger for a few short seconds.All Time Low's 'Dear Maria, Count Me In' spawned a trend where users explained that they never went through an emo phase, but rather, joined a lifestyle. Simple Plan's \"I’m Just A Kid\" led to a trend where the community recreated their own vintage family photos. And Paramore's \"All I Wanted\" has been used in thousands of videos covering practically every genre.The caption to the video which spawned the All Time Low trend is especially notable stating, \"in search of pop punk tiktok.\" This video speaks to the way that TikTok can spawn communities by prompting like-minded users with similar interests to find one another, helping some relieve their youth, while providing an introduction to a genre to new audiences. TikTok is all about communities, and \"pop punk tiktok\" is just the latest example of a subculture gaining mainstream popularity. Notable Video Hot Track: How to Save a LifeThe Fray's 2005 hit \"How to Save a Life\" is finding new life on TikTok as the soundtrack to a popular new trend where couples lovingly poke fun at each others quirks. Starting with the chorus lyrics \"where did I go wrong,\" each video ends with the creator's significant other or friend being adorably quirky. From a spouse getting brain freeze or performing unique dances, this trend shows appreciation for the weird habits of the people we love. Hot Effect: Love OutlineJust in time for Valentines Day, Love Outline lets creators add a heart themed outline to their videos. Creator Spotlight: @taylorcassidyjThe authentic changemaker and Black TikTok Trailblazer, @taylorcassidyj, is making a name for herself on TikTok with her inspiring Black culture content and creative techniques for teaching Black history.

Read more from Kristine below as she dives into her journey on TikTok, her inspiration, and her advice to those starting out.How did you get started creating on TikTok, and what was the first TikTok video you shared/published?I got started on TikTok as a way to further showcase women that look like me. I wasn't doing much video content at the time and loved how different the platform was. My first video was a fun video to make light of quarantine since it was such a daunting time.Why do you think TikTok is the right platform for your content or why do you continue to create and share on TikTok?I love how real and raw TikTok is. Video is the purest form of content and you can really connect on a deeper level, unlike with just photos. My content is centered around loving yourself at any size, so TikTok gives me the opportunity to be my authentic self.What is your favorite TikTok you have made to date and why?My favorite video is actually one that has also gotten the highest amount of views. I've always been frustrated with how society/the media portrays women of a certain size. Larger women are often seen as very insecure and that couldn't be further from the truth. So, I did a video to show the difference between how we are viewed versus how we actually are, which is confident, & stylish. That video has over 5.2 million views. What lights a fire in you?What lights a fire in me is overcoming the odds. We as Black people have so many statistics and percentages and road blocks that come against us that, when we win anyways, when we exercise black excellence anyhow, there is no feeling like it.What Black historical figure inspires you?There are way too many Black icons who inspire me to name just one. But if I must, I would say that it is the woman that is the epitome of beauty, class, grace, poise, education, and execellence and that is our forever first lady Michelle Obama.Any advice for new creators?Be yourself! There is no one in the world like you and TikTok thrives on originality. There are so many unique accounts on the platform that there is sure to be an audience & community that can relate to your content.What does being a Trailblazer mean to you?It is such an incredible honor to be a Trailblazer. I don't view myself as someone that blazes trails, just a girl trying everyday to love herself while sharing that journey with others. I think it more represents the women of whom I give a voice to and the community that I have created.Who are some Black creators that everyone should be following/watching?Black creators we should be following are everyone on the Black Trailblazers list – I've even discovered some new people that I wasn't familiar with. We are all so different, so creative, so unique."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/three-tiktok-features-every-parent-should-know","date":"2021-02-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"Three TikTok features every parent should know","text":"By Tracy Elizabeth, Global Minor Safety Policy Lead, TikTokWhen it comes to parenting a teen's digital life, daunting is one word that comes to mind.

That's why we're excited to kick off our Creator Spotlight Series – ongoing feature stories highlighting our amazing creators and how they're inspiring creativity and joy every day.In honor of Black History Month, we're starting off with our Black Trailblazers, learning more about their journey on TikTok and what it means to be a Trailblazer to the community.First up is a creator who has been taking TikTok by storm, @taylorcassidyj. The authentic changemaker is making a name for herself on TikTok with her inspiring Black culture content and creative techniques for teaching Black history.From her educational series Fast Black History to her hype videos of other Black creators called Black Girl Magic, every day brings something new and exciting. We chatted with Taylor to learn more about her journey on TikTok – see below to read more in her own words!How did you get started creating on TikTok, and what was the first TikTok video you shared/published?I started creating on TikTok after being a viewer for about month. Everytime I opened the app and saw other people's content, I couldn't help but have more and more video ideas inspired by their creativity, so I eventually started to post content. The first video I posted was with an echoing audio saying, \"What are we going to do now?\" I was holding a pencil pretending to take a test with the caption, \"Me struggling on a test\" as the audio started to echo, the caption read \"everyone cheating off me\". It wasn't too complex, but I was proud of it.Why do you think TikTok is the right platform for your content or why do you continue to create and share on TikTok?TikTok is very fast-paced. With only 60 seconds to create, it's challenged me to get creative with how much information I can deliver in a video effectively. I think my content has worked so well on TikTok, because I not only teach people something they may not have known, but I encourage them to find pride and joy in themselves and their culture. I continue to create because I want to give people the content I needed when I was younger to discover my Black identity and have confidence in it.What is your favorite TikTok you have made to date and why?That's a hard question! I think I'd pick a TikTok I posted this past year. It was a Black History video about Mum Bet, the first Black woman to have freedom in Massachusetts. It was the first time I took a more cinematic and creative approach to telling Black history and I ended up having so much fun. What lights a fire in you?Creativity lights a fire in me. Whenever I come up with a new idea to tell a story a different way with black history, I just get so excited whenever a big idea comes into my head. I get the biggest smile on my face and I'm like I\" need to write this down right now\". I'll will work for hours on end on one specific idea because creativity is endless, it's boundless and there are no limits. In Maya Angelou's words, the more you use your mind the more there is – the more you use your creativity the more creativity you make so thats what really lights a fire in me.What Black historical figure inspires you?A black historical figure that inspires me is Maya Angelou because a lot of people know her as a poet, but in reality she was a variety of different things all throughout her life time. She was a dancer, an actress, a singer as well as a poet and she was a professor. She really inspires me because not only did she do all of these things, she was multifaceted and didn't limit herself to being one thing. And that is something that I wish over my life that I accomplish everything that I'm passionate about and not just stick to one thing that I'm passionate about because I'm afraid.Any advice for new creators?Choose impact over popularity. No matter what your content is, make sure that it's something you love with or without the views. In the end, that view number isn't what's going to make impact, rather it will be your passion and authenticity that will make waves.What does being a Trailblazer mean to you?First, being a trailblazer gives me great gratitude. I am so honored to have been recognized as someone who pushed the boundaries of TikTok to make it a better place to be. It makes me look back on my younger self who was insecure in her skin color, hair texture, and way of speaking and say, \"Look what you did. Look how insecurity didn't win.\" It also sparks vision in me to keep challenging limits and the impossible; being named a trailblazer doesn't mean I'm done paving the way. I'm still making history.Who are some Black creators that everyone should be following/watching?Two black creators that I think everyone should be following first is @anania00. He is hilarious and does comedy. Every time I watch one of his videos I get weak, my stomach hurts from laughing so much and he's so creative with his comedy! Also, @khimberlie is an artist, but she does photoshoots with her art and she creates the most beautiful scenes in her living room. She just goes all out with every single scene, she serves no matter what, no matter the time in every post. She is just full of creativity and she glows in just every photo shoot that she does."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share","date":"2021-02-02T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"New prompts to help people consider before they share","text":"By Gina Hernandez, Product Manager, Trust & SafetyPeople come to TikTok to be creative, find community, and have fun. Being authentic is valued by our community, and we take the responsibility of helping counter inauthentic, misleading, or false content to heart.We remove misinformation as we identify it and partner with fact checkers at PolitiFact, Lead Stories, and SciVerify to help us assess the accuracy of content. If fact checks confirm content to be false, we'll remove the video from our platform.Sometimes fact checks are inconclusive or content is not able to be confirmed, especially during unfolding events. In these cases, a video may become ineligible for recommendation into anyone's For You feed to limit the spread of potentially misleading information. Today, we're taking that a step further to inform viewers when we identify a video with unsubstantiated content in an effort to reduce sharing.Here's how it works: First, a viewer will see a banner on a video if the content has been reviewed but cannot be conclusively validated.The video's creator will also be notified that their video was flagged as unsubstantiated content.If a viewer attempts to share the flagged video, they’ll see a prompt reminding them that the video has been flagged as unverified content. This additional step requires a pause for people to consider their next move before they choose to \"cancel\" or \"share anyway.\"We love that our community’s creativity encourages people to share TikTok videos with others who might enjoy them – both within our platform and beyond – but we’ve designed this feature to help our users be mindful about what they share. In fact, when we tested this approach we saw viewers decrease the rate at which they shared videos by 24%, while likes on such unsubstantiated content also decreased by 7%.This feature will be rolling out globally over the coming weeks, starting today in the US and Canada. It was designed and tested with Irrational Labs, a behavioral science lab, and is a continuation of our ongoing work to advance media literacy, including the series of \"Be Informed\" educational videos we created in partnership with the National Association of Media Literacy Education. These videos explain the difference between fact and opinion, how to analyze graphics, understand sources, and reflect on whether the content should be shared. We believe that media literacy is crucial to enhancing the online experience for everyone and are continuing to invest in product experiences that help promote an authentic and welcoming community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/celebrating-blackness-past-present-and-future","date":"2021-01-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Celebrating Blackness past, present, and future","text":"This Black History Month, we're thrilled to celebrate Black excellence and honor the Black community on TikTok as we kick off #MakeBlackHistory.

Take a deeper look at the content with this new feature in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects.Current Top Trend: #GreenScreenScanAt TikTok, we love providing utility when it comes to the Creative Effects offered to our users. Previously, we've shown how Green Screen and Time Warp Scan provided users with tools they could interpret in any number of ways. That theme continued over the last several weeks as users embraced our newly released Green Screen Scan, a new Creative Effect that combines two of the most-used features in-app.With Green Screen Scan, users select a photo from their camera roll (just like in Green Screen) and are then \"scanned\" into the selected image (similar to Time Warp Scan).At first, a single format known as the \"Renaissance Challenge\" gained popularity utilizing the effect before it was released globally. Users would pose in front of Renaissance art and be \"scanned\" into the painting. These videos became so popular that users without access to the feature went to great lengths to develop their own workflows to achieve the same effect. Oftentimes this meant downloading multiple applications and working with image editing software to achieve the desired look. Eventually, the Creative Effect was launched worldwide, with some users expressing excitement and comedic frustration that they had spent hours on a video, only for TikTok to launch the same effect.What's really interesting though, is the way in which the Creative Effect has been used since launch. While the Renaissance Challenge was extremely popular at first, multiple micro-trends have popped up in the last few weeks. In these trends, users have posed with their younger selves, created mock meet and greet photos with celebrities, and even made family photos with relatives who have passed on.Seeing how users utilize this and other popular effects is always inspiring and emphasizes that everyone in our community can be a creator. @jenellelevans Getting #Bridgerton / #Renaissance vibes. 💯🥰 #RenaissanceChallenge ♬ original sound - Natalie Pienkawa blNotable Video Hot Track: drivers licenseOlivia Rodrigo's new hit \"drivers license\" dropped January 8 and nearly doubled in creations and video views within the first week on the platform and has been growing since. The song blends authentic, emotional lyrics with amazing vocals to create the current #1 Billboard Top 100 song that has inspired countless TikTok creators to express themselves. Videos that use the song or speculate on the lyrics have taken off, helping #driverslicense cross 1 billion views.

Take a deeper look at the content form this trend in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects.Current Top Trend: #Stitch\"Show me how without showing me how...\"This week, we're taking a look at the emergence of the recently-released Stitch feature and its role in evolving storytelling formats on TikTok.Initially released in September, Stitch is a feature that allows users to clip and integrate scenes from another user's video into their own. Similarly to our Duet tool, Stitch is a way for users to reinterpret, respond to, and build upon content created by the community, building on everything from storytelling, to tutorials, and even sitting down for Q&A sessions.Like many of our other features and Creative Effects, it took some time for users to develop a variety of content formats that make use of the tool. The prototypical use can be seen in one of our tutorial videos, which shows users creating comedic sketches alongside one another.However, since its initial release, the Stitch feature has evolved and enabled the development of several storytelling trends that narrow in on a question and response format. In these videos, users \"Stitch\" another user's question or prompt, before cutting back to their own response. In one version, users explained how \"they know their partner won't cheat on them\" by lovingly demonstrating their quirky hobbies. In another, users shared their random interactions with celebrities. In each of these trends, the prompt leads the videos before an individual user shares their own unique story.Stitch is a good example of how TikTok’s creative tools help the community create compelling content and develop new, original formats by sparking users' creativity. It engages users who may be less interested in creating content and makes becoming a creator accessible. Here's to continuing this trend in 2021. Notable Video Hot Track: Steven UniverseL. Dre's \"Steven Universe\" offers users a mellow tune and solid beat that elevates content of all genres.

And so is privacy. That's why we empower our community with a range of controls to manage their online presence. As young people start their digital journey, we believe it's important to provide them with age-appropriate privacy settings and controls. Today we're announcing changes for users under age 18 aimed at driving higher default standards for user privacy and safety.Enhanced default privacy settingsStarting today, we're changing the default privacy setting for all registered accounts ages 13-15 to private. With a private TikTok account, only someone who the user approves as a follower can view their videos. We want our younger users to be able to make informed choices about what and with whom they choose to share, which includes whether they want to open their account to public views. By engaging them early in their privacy journey, we can enable them to make more deliberate decisions about their online privacy.Additional changes we're rolling out to promote a safe experience for our younger users include:Tightening the options for commenting on videos created by those ages 13-15. These users can now choose between Friends or No One for their account; the Everyone comment setting is being removed.Changing Duet and Stitch settings to now make these features available on content created by users age 16 and over only. For users ages 16-17, the default setting for Duet and Stitch will now be set to Friends.Allowing downloads of videos that have been created by users 16 and over only. Other users can decide whether they want to allow downloads of their videos, though for users ages 16-17 the default setting will now be changed to Off unless they decide to enable it.Setting \"Suggest your account to others\" to Off by default for users ages 13-15.Adjusting TikTok's default account settings to support stronger user privacy is a meaningful step in our ongoing commitment to keeping our younger users safe. These changes build on previous updates we've made to promote youth safety, including:Restricting direct messaging and hosting live streams to accounts 16 and over.Restricting the buying, sending, and receiving of virtual gifts to users below 18.Enabling parents and caregivers to set guardrails on their teen’s TikTok experience through our Family Pairing features.An update on TikTok for Younger UsersIn the US, we accommodate users under 13 in a limited app experience, TikTok for Younger Users, which offers additional safeguards and privacy protections designed specifically for a younger audience. This experience allows users to browse a curated library of age-appropriate videos, and today we're pleased to announce a partnership with Common Sense Networks as we continue to improve upon this experience. Through our partnership, Common Sense Networks will provide additional guidance on the appropriateness of content for children under 13 as we work to create an enjoyable and safe viewing experience.A pioneering approach to privacyThere's nothing more important than the safety and privacy of our community. We regularly publish Transparency Reports, and we continue to show experts and policymakers how we operate, moderate and recommend content, and secure user data at our Transparency and Accountability Centers. We also have privacy information on our Safety Center.We know there is no finish line when it comes to protecting users and their privacy, and our investment in this important area won't stop here. We'll continue to evolve our policies, work closely with regulators and experts in minor safety, and invest in our technology and teams so that TikTok remains a safe place for everyone to express their creativity.What youth safety experts are saying“We couldn’t be more pleased about partnering with TikTok to develop better content experiences for users under the age of 13. At Common Sense Networks, we see this engagement as an opportunity to double down on our commitment to elevate the quality of children’s digital media so that age-appropriate content is the rule in our industry and not the exception.” – Eric Berger, CEO, Common Sense Networks\"National PTA applauds TikTok for advancing safe and age-appropriate experiences where teens can have fun and be creative. With TikTok's thoughtful changes to teens' privacy settings, National PTA continues to recommend that families sit down together, explore the app's safety controls and tools, and have open and ongoing conversations to help teens be safe and responsible online. This is particularly important to ensure teens' accounts are set up right from the start. PTA looks forward to continuing our important work with TikTok to educate families across the country about online safety.\" - Leslie Boggs, President, National PTA\"When it comes to social media, one size does not fit all. For example, there is a big difference in the maturity of young teens and older teens and it's important that be reflected in privacy settings. TikTok's recent privacy updates honor these differences by placing age-appropriate defaults on teens' account settings that provide an extra layer of protection for younger teens and a greater amount of freedom for older teens.\" - Larry Magid, CEO, ConnectSafely\"Putting these new measures in place is another positive step forward in TikTok's safety and privacy efforts,\" said the Family Online Safety Institute. \"Thinking ahead about what is appropriate for teens of different ages creates an opportunity for these younger users to learn and grow responsibly on the platform, and serves as an important teachable moment when they do gain those abilities.\" – Stephen Balkam, CEO, Family Online Safety Institute“MediaSmarts' research has shown that young people care strongly about protecting their privacy, but that they are also strongly influenced by the default settings of the platforms they use. Changing the defaults is a positive first step to respect young people's developing understanding of privacy, by helping them manage who sees and interacts with their content.” - Kathryn Ann Hill, Executive Director, MediaSmarts\"It's critical that platforms provide families with meaningful choices to help protect their children and guide them to make safer decisions about their online presence. We are encouraged by TikTok's continued work to enhance the options families have and create higher standards of default privacy settings. These efforts have the power to help young people stay safer online.\" – John Clark, President & CEO, NCMEC\"These latest improvements from TikTok mark a major step forward in enhancing the privacy and safety of children on their platform. Privacy by default, removing the ability for strangers to comment on children’s videos and restricting downloads are important steps in the fight against the grooming, sexual exploitation and abuse of children online. We look forward to continuing this vital work with TikTok along with the rest of our members from governments, private sector and civil society, to ensure that children worldwide can enjoy the opportunities technology can bring without the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse.” – Iain Drennan, Executive Director, WeProtect Global Alliance"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-ratatouille-the-musical-makes-it-to-broadway-and-streams-on-tiktok","date":"2021-01-07T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok's Ratatouille: The Musical makes it to Broadway and streams on TikTok","text":"All donations to benefit The Actors FundTheater creatives have long been collaborative leaders on TikTok, creating everything from videos about their art school experiences, to showcasing their talents and writing musicals. Over the last few months, however, this community made headlines as they collaborated on the construction of a musical based on Disney/Pixar’s Ratatouille, and with the help of the Tony Award-winning theatrical production company Seaview, presented a full virtual performance to benefit The Actors Fund proving that anyone can cook up an amazing show. The one-of-a-kind virtual benefit garnered $1 million by its premiere on January 1, 2021 for The Actors Fund, the national human services organization for everyone in performing arts and entertainment.This creative endeavor began with user @e_jaccs, who back in August, uploaded a love ballad dedicated to “Remy,” the main character in Disney/Pixar’s Ratatouille. The song gained new life when @danieljmertzlufft uploaded a new version of the initial video on October 19th. Notably, @danieljmertzlufft had previously created a musical on TikTok entitled \"Grocery Store: A New Musical.\" Over the next week, the video grew in popularity and became beloved throughout the TikTok community, eventually leading to the creation of an account entitled @ratatouillemusical, which made a video calling for community submissions to help bring the musical to life. This video prompted users to contribute their own ideas to the fictional musical, covering everything from additional numbers, to sets, and even dance routines. The musical theater community has collaborated on the project using #RatatouilleMusical, a tag that has gained 227.1 million views to date. By mid-November, the popularity of the fictional musical had spread off-platform, gaining the attention of everyone from Patton Oswalt - the voice of Remy - and Brad Bird - the film's director, to Pixar and Disney, Playbill and Broadway World, who created pamphlets for the show, and even the New York Times.It was here that what started as a community collaboration became a fully-fledged virtual Broadway show with the help Broadway veterans.

To maintain this environment, we've made important progress over the past year to further develop our safety infrastructure. In January, we updated our Community Guidelines because we wanted to make our values more clear, and this month we refreshed those guidelines to illustrate how our thinking on complex issues such as self-harm and bullying is constantly evolving.In all that we do – expanding our global Trust and Safety hubs, launching safety features, initiating partnerships with industry experts – we aim to keep TikTok a home for safe, creative, and authentic expression. As we look to the new year, we reflect on how we've grown and what we learned in 2020.Promoting authenticity on TikTokWe care deeply about promoting authenticity and limiting the spread of misleading information. Over the course of the year we strengthened our integrity policies and introduced additional reporting options to help our community flag concerning content and accounts. We also developed relationships with fact checkers to help us assess the accuracy of content relating to elections, COVID-19, vaccines, and other content.At the same time, we made significant investments in digital literacy education to help our users make informed decisions about the content they see online – from our \"Be Informed\" series in the US to the #thinkb4youdo campaign in Singapore to our media literacy initiative with the Génération Numérique NGO in France.To hold ourselves publicly accountable, we've signed the European Union's Code of Practice on Disinformation and pledge to fight against disinformation on TikTok to support genuine content and interactions. We believe that misinformation harms the trust-based environment our users want and deserve, and we invest in measures to combat it.Continuing our commitment to transparencyTransparency is critical to building trust with our community. This year we enhanced our safety infrastructure to enable us to explain why content may be removed, make it easier to appeal a removal, and bring even more detail to our Transparency Reports.Brands are a growing part of the TikTok community and we’re dedicated to helping them connect with audiences safely. Our partnerships and integrations with OpenSlate, the Trustworthy Accountability Group in the UK, and the Global Alliance for Responsible Media are aimed at promoting brand safety and holding us accountable for removing harmful content.Additionally, we opened our first Transparency and Accountability Centers to provide policymakers and experts with a first-hand view into how we operate, moderate and recommend content, and work to maintain privacy and security. TikTok aims to be an industry leader when it comes to transparency into how we operate and keep users safe, and we'll continue to make improvements along the way.Keeping TikTok secureSecurity is always top of mind for us, and we're constantly improving our systems to protect our community and their information. In addition to our dedicated global security team, we've partnered with HackerOne to expand our public bug bounty program, allowing us to reinforce our defense systems through the help of global security researchers and industry experts. This is an area where we hope to grow alongside our community. In that spirit, we also regularly provide security updates and work with partners, such as the Center for Digital Society and the Onno Center in Indonesia, to publish white papers about cybersecurity.Caring for our global community is a complex undertaking that requires nuanced and ever-evolving measures. We prioritize security because our users deserve peace of mind when they open the app. Without it, TikTok could not be the home for creative expression.Prioritizing the well-being of our communityThe coronavirus pandemic has impacted all of us, and we're committed to doing our part to keep our community informed. Early this year, we launched an in-app coronavirus resource hub and mounted campaigns – including #HeapsGood in Australia to spread positivity during the pandemic, the #vudieruatay hand-washing challenge in Vietnam to encourage hygienic practices, and #happyathome to help people across the world remember that we're all one community.Well-being extends beyond physical health – emotional health is just as important. Over the past year, we increasingly sought the advice of mental-health experts as we developed more inclusive and comprehensive policies on self-injury, eating disorder content, bullying, and harassment. We also introduced emotional-support resources with evidence-based actions someone can take if they're struggling with their well-being.This year, we participated in Brazil's Yellow September suicide prevention campaign that advocated for improved access to mental health services. In recognition of World Mental Health Awareness Day we fostered heartfelt conversations among TikTok users about their experiences by debuting the #MentalHealthMatters hashtag in the US and announcing a collective of creators who share inspiring well-being content in the UK. We hope to help de-stigmatize mental health by enabling conversations and connection so that those struggling know they're not alone.It's important to us that everyone on TikTok feels comfortable and confident expressing themselves. We recently strengthened our policies against bullying and will continue listening to experts as we work to improve. For instance, we developed campaigns, workshops, and programs that advocate for good digital citizenship and online kindness with the Parent Teacher Association in the US, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology in Indonesia, and NASSCOM Foundation in India.Showing care for our younger usersOn TikTok you'll find a diverse mix of people, from grandparents learning new dance moves to teenagers finding creative ways to capture their everyday lives. We want everyone to feel safe on TikTok, and that’s especially true for our younger users. While TikTok is for users aged 13+, we recognize that teens' experience can differ greatly from those who are older.We dedicate significant time to understanding the special journey teens and young adults embark on as they develop their online identities. We regularly speak to parents and teens to learn about their perspectives so we can set them up for a positive TikTok experience with tools for screen time management, privacy, and comments. Caring for younger teens is a critical effort, and we work hard to stay alert to potentially harmful behaviors and update our tools, policies, and practices accordingly, for example through our recently updated policy on harmful activities by minors.We continued our work with leading youth safety organizations, such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Family Online Safety Institute, and ConnectSafely, to prioritize the safety of youth on TikTok. With their input, we developed Family Pairing and our Youth Portal to educate teens about digital literacy and foster conversations about online safety within families. Based on youth-safety research, direct messaging and live streaming aren’t available for registered accounts under 16 as we work to reduce the potential for negative experiences or harm. TikTok also committed to the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Exploitation and are members of WePROTECT Global Alliance.Building with empathy and inclusivitySafety and inclusion go hand-in-hand, and we believe in maintaining an environment that celebrates everyone. We've evolved our hate speech policy to better account for scenarios where underrepresented groups may feel excluded or marginalized and to counter hateful ideologies.It's critical that we listen to the perspectives of our users, learn from them, and act. We honor Black History month, LGBTQ+ community celebrations, and other important occasions that enable meaningful conversations among community. In the US, we launched the Creator Diversity Collective featuring users from different backgrounds who regularly meet with our team to discuss and share ideas around how we can center representation, diversity, and inclusion both within our programs and on the platform.True inclusivity means building a platform that everyone can easily use and enjoy. We still have work to do on this front, and we're taking important steps to make our platform safer for those with visual sensitivities. We now notify creators when they produce videos that may trigger photosensitive epilepsy and have introduced a feature that lets people skip photosensitive content. We've also introduced opt-in viewing screens on top of videos that some may find graphic or distressing. Additionally, we’ve rolled out a text-to-speech feature that turns typed text to audio.Feeling safe is critical to feeling comfortable expressing yourself and being creative. This year has been filled with tremendous growth and challenges as well as opportunities to innovate around community safety and support. We've worked to build a sustainable infrastructure that puts the safety of our users first. As we expand upon this foundation, we're determined to be even more thoughtful and proactive in the ways that we care for our community in the year to come."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-family-and-friends-find-holiday-togetherness-with-a-classic-commercial","date":"2020-12-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok family and friends find holiday togetherness with a classic commercial","text":"This year, families are experiencing a holiday season like never before. A time of year typically filled with gatherings of friends and family are now spent social distancing and staying \"in your pod.\" This feeling led to a unique mix of nostalgia and longing that TikTok creators expressed through their content. One creator even made a video remembering a classic Cheerios commercial from the 90s and explained how it could apply to 2020. The video touched a feeling that so many of us have, and Cheerios, listening to the community, looked to recreate this moment of togetherness to bring the community's idea to life. They quickly got to work writing, producing, and hunting down all of the original actors - baby included - before releasing a series of TikTok videos announcing that the 20 year old commercial was getting the \"part 2\" everyone wanted. Just in time for the Christmas holiday, Cheerios released the new made-for-TikTok commercial packed with all of the emotions and nostalgia users were hoping for during this challenging holiday season. The process for creating this one of a kind commercial reboot was one of the ways TikTok connects communities and launches ideas. Plus, it gave everyone involved some much needed warm feelings during a time when we might not be able to be near the ones we love."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/bye-2020-welcome-2021-join-us-at-tiktoks-nye-party","date":"2020-12-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"#Bye2020, #Welcome2021: Join us at TikTok LIVE’s NYE party","text":"This year, TikTok brought some much needed light to a tough 2020.

As the spaces where people normally enjoy music were impacted by the pandemic, TikTok helped fill the need for communal musical experience in the US. Powered by its community, TikTok became America's go-to platform for music discovery, as well as a launching pad for smash hits by artists of all genres.The growth of TikTok in 2020 produced some staggering numbers. Over 176 different songs surpassed 1 billion video views as TikTok sounds. Earlier this month, \"The Playlist\" was revealed as part of the Year On TikTok: Top 100 retrospective, highlighting the most significant songs on TikTok in 2020. Together, those songs racked up over 50 billion video views on over 125 million creations, and 5 of them reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Nearly 90 songs that trended on the platform in 2020 climbed onto the Top 100 charts in the U.S., with 15 of those reaching #1 on a Billboard chart. Just in the past year over 70 artists that have broken on the platform have received major label deals, including Claire Rosinkranz, Dixie D'Amelio, Powfu, Priscilla Block and Tai Verdes, and dozens more have charted on Rolling Stone's Breakthrough 25.

Drake's ultra-viral \"Toosie Slide\" generated a billion views in just three days, and superstar collab \"WAP\" by Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion did the same in just two weeks. Other songs, like Harry Styles' \"Watermelon Sugar\" and Surf Mesa's \"ily (i love you baby)\" had slow and steady climbs that sustained the better part of a year. The below list of the ten fastest songs to reach 1 billion video views reflects the community's enthusiasm for new songs by stars like Drake and Billie Eilish, but some of the year's most viral hits came from unexpected sources. The list includes rap hits from regional stars like Detroit's Sada Baby and Houston's BeatKing, and songs by artists like Popp Hunna and WhoHeem who were virtually unknown before their viral moment. Songs didn't have to be new, or even recently released to cross the billion view threshold: \"Say I Yi Yi\" (2002) and \"Where Is The Love?\" (2003) demonstrated how the TikTok community can turn catalog cuts into viral hits. Check out the top ten below: \"Toosie Slide \" - Drake\"WAP\" (feat. Megan Thee Stallion) - Cardi B\"Therefore I Am\" - Billie Eilish\"Lets Link\" - WhoHeem\"Say I Yi Yi\" - Ying Yang Twins\"Where Is The Love?\" - The Black Eyed Peas\"Whole Lotta Choppas\" - Sada Baby\"Adderall (Corvette Corvette)\" - Popp Hunna\"Mood Swings\" - Pop Smoke\"THICK\" - DJ Chose & BeatkingPick Your Sound: Top GenresTikTok is home to a diverse community, with diverse tastes to match. Trending music on TikTok encompasses the entirety of the music spectrum, its most popular genres echoing the tastes of the public at large. Boosted by megastars like Megan Thee Stallion and DaBaby, but also by up-and-comers like Kenndogg, Popp Hunna, and countless others, Hip-Hop led the way by a large margin. Coming in second was pop music, bolstered by big names like BTS, Justin Bieber, and Dua Lipa. Other genres that caught the community's attention include R&B (stars like The Weeknd, Jhené Aiko, and risers like Vedo and Tai Verdes), Electronic (Dillon Francis, Alan Walker, and Diplo show the playful sides of their personalities on their TikTok pages), and the broad indie-alternative coalition (ranging from Wallows to MGMT to Molchat Doma). Among the biggest growing genres is Latin music, whose trending songs ranged from trap/reggaeton bangers like Ozuna's \"Caramelo\" to traditionalist tracks like \"Espejeando\" by Los Tucanes De Tijuana. Meanwhile, internet-savvy Country stars like Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen, Kelsea Ballerini and Breland helped the genre have another strong year on the platform.NOTE: The graphic above lists the top 10 genres on the platform by number of video creations, represented by the percentage of video creations with sounds from each genre.They've Got The Hits: Top Artist CatalogThe TikTok community gravitates to songs that are confident, empowering, sonically unique, and danceable. It should be no surprise that TikTok's most popular artists of 2020 are experts at creating these kinds of bops. Scoring a viral hit on the platform helps build familiarity for the artist–if an artist has one viral hit, there's a very good chance that subsequent songs will have success as well. The ten most-viewed artist of the year each built up their resumes with multiple TikTok hits.Megan Thee Stallion scored two of the year's biggest hits with \"Savage\" and \"WAP,\" while nearly the entirety of Doja Cat's Hot Pink album inspired a TikTok trend. The community honored the memory of Pop Smoke by making trending hits out of four songs from his debut album Shoot For The Stars, Aim For The Moon, which spent the whole summer in the Billboard Top 5. Rap stars like Roddy Ricch, DaBaby, and Lil Uzi Vert delivered turn-up, Dua Lipa brought Future Nostalgia, and Don Toliver delivered smooth-voiced vibes. Meanwhile, Melanie Martinez established herself as a major pop star with the flirty single \"Play Date,\" and 20-year-old 24kGoldn broke big on the Billboard charts with \"Mood\" ft. iann dior.Check out the ten most viewed artists by catalog on TikTok in 2020: Megan Thee StallionDoja CatPop SmokeDaBabyRoddy RicchMelanie MartinezDon ToliverDua Lipa24kGoldnLil Uzi VertThe Come Up: Emerging ArtistsIn 2020, TikTok cemented its position as the go-to platform for music discovery, becoming a launching pad for unknown artists to build momentum for their careers.

Artists like Prince and Queen made their mark on the platform with dramatic entrances and others like John Lennon (\"Beautiful Boy\") and Oasis (\"Wonderwall\") scored viral hits from their catalog. Below, check out some TikTok accounts that help bolster the legacy of icons.PrinceElton JohnJohn LennonOasisQueenGeorge MichaelStevie NicksRemember These? Songs Revitalized On TikTokMany songs that trend on TikTok come from current stars or emerging artists, but an ever-growing number of TikTok trends use sounds from songs that are years, or even decades old. A well-placed TikTok can revive interest in well-known classics (world, meet @420doggface208) or dig up a forgotten hit (L'Trimm's 1988 classic \"Cars That Go Boom\" generated 2.6 million creations). Many catalog songs experienced a massive increase in streams as a result of trending on TikTok–spurred by a high profile trend, Fleetwood Mac's \"Dreams\" re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 after a 43-year absence. Check out some catalog hits that had a major impact in the past year.\"Dreams\" - Fleetwood Mac\"It's Tricky\" - Run DMC\"Bullletproof\" - La Roux\"I'm Just A Kid\" - Simple Plan \"How Bizarre\" - OMC\"Mr. Blue Sky\" - ELO\"Beautiful Boy\" - John Lennon\"Cars That Go Boom\" - L'Trimm\"Because of You\" - Ne-Yo\"No Role Modelz\" - J. Cole\"Rasputin\" - Boney M.\"Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom\" - Vengaboys\"Promiscuous\" - Nelly Furtado\"Girlfriend\" - Avril Lavigne\"Potential Breakup Song\" - Aly & AJ\"Where Is The Love?\" - The Black Eyed Peas\"Say I Yi Yi\" - Ying Yang TwinsOn TikTok, sounds and the creative videos that accompany them come together to foster emotional connections between music and its listeners, inspiring users to flock to streaming services to play these songs on repeat. People who discover music on TikTok are taking the power of popularizing songs and artists into their own hands, making TikTok the most democratic platform in the world, freed from the limitations of programmed radio or streaming playlists. A viral song on TikTok can come from any year, any genre, or any artist, fueled by a community eager to find and share new musical obsessions. The community’s endless creativity can redefine a song’s context, creating an immersive universe with the song at its center.As the music world hopes for a return to relative normalcy in 2021, TikTok and its passionate community will still be there, minting hits and discovering new superstars. One thing is clear: if you want to know what is pushing music forward, keep scrolling down your “For You” page."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-10-m-donation-to-support-future-black-latinx-indigenous-health-heroes","date":"2020-12-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Powering the Next Generation of #HealthHeroes","text":"2020 has been a difficult year for many, but through it all there's been an unwavering symbol of hope and humanity shining through: healthcare workers. From epidemiologists to doctors to surge staff, front line healthcare workers are deserving heroes across the country – and these #healthheroes are equally lauded figures within the TikTok community, which is part of why we donated $150 million earlier this year through our Health Heroes Relief Fund.Today, as a continuation of our commitment to supporting the efforts of healthcare workers, we're donating $10 million to 10 academic institutions that serve underrepresented students with programs focused on public health and professions in the medical and healthcare fields. Each school will receive $1 million in funding to support undergraduate and graduate scholarships for students pursuing medical careers or other health related fields, helping to ensure the success of future Black, Latinx, and Indigenous health heroes. According to a 2018 article in Harvard Business Review, Black people make up 13 percent of the US population; but only four percent of US doctors and less than seven percent of US medical students self-identify as Black. In a qualitative study of Black students' perspectives on careers in medicine in the Journal of the National Medical Association, students reported financial constraints as one of the major barriers in pursuing a career in medicine. We believe investing in the next generation of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous doctors, nurses, pediatricians, surgeons, and other essential health care workers is one of the best ways to invest in the future of America. \"We are grateful to TikTok for recognizing the power of everyday health heroes like the ones we are developing on our campus in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. The University's Public and Allied Health Department, chaired by Dr. Robert C. Mason, and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michelle Fisher RN managed a small army of employee and student volunteer who came out every test day - rain or shine - to administer the 35,000 tests necessary to keep us all safe. There were dozens of them on duty every day, and these are our heroes.\" - Dr. Tony Allen, President of Delaware State University“We feel honored to have been selected for this generous gift. This partnership will help hundreds of students pursue their educational goals in health sciences and make an immediate, extraordinary impact in our community as we continue innovating and being a leader in education across the nation. This generous gift is crucial to the innovation and advancement in healthcare, sciences and technology needed to respond to the global challenges posed by the pandemic. TikTok has selected Laredo College as the sole recipient amongst community colleges nationwide. I believe that this is due to our leadership, innovation, and excellence.” - Dr. Ricardo J. Solis, President of Laredo College\"The University of South Dakota is home to the state’s only medical school and only comprehensive school of health sciences, and our students are among the most skilled, compassionate and capable. They are tomorrow’s leaders in health care. This scholarship enables us to better support Native American students, students from underrepresented communities and students with financial need as they pursue academic excellence and become our future health heroes.” - Sheila K. Gestring, President of University of South Dakota\"Many Xavierites have excelled to become the health heroes that are in high demand during the global pandemic. This gift from TikTok allows talented young women and men with dreams to sharpen their gifts and succeed at becoming change agents in our community and across the nation through education.\" - Reynold Verret, President of Xavier University of LouisianaThe gift benefits Xavier University of Louisiana, Tougaloo College, North Carolina Central University, North Carolina A&T University, South Carolina State University, Laredo College, University of South Dakota, Florida A&M, Delaware State, and Virginia Union University. The $1 million scholarships to each school will help ensure that students have access to the exceptional education in the medical and health fields offered at each of these institutions. These 10 gifts are an investment in the future of the next generation of #healthheroes, who will reflect the diverse patchwork of American healthcare workers."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/refreshing-our-policies-to-support-community-well-being","date":"2020-12-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"Refreshing our policies to support community well-being","text":"By Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust & Safety, TikTokToday we're announcing refreshed Community Guidelines with additional details about what's allowed on TikTok. Our Community Guidelines support the authentic and entertaining TikTok experience that people know and enjoy. They define a common code of conduct and encourage a welcoming community environment. We continually review and strengthen our policies to help everyone feel comfortable and safe to create and share on TikTok.Promoting inclusive policiesAt TikTok, safety isn't a nice-to-have or an afterthought; it's central to all our work, and our teams strive to be inclusive and thoughtful when developing our policies. Our guidelines apply to everyone and all content on TikTok and broadly cover 10 categories of content. This update adds more specifics to each area based on behavior we've seen on platform, feedback we've heard from our community, and input from academics, civil society organizations, and our Content Advisory Council.While much of this content was covered by our previous guidelines, we're highlighting some of the key areas we've strengthened to better support the well-being of our community.We want our community to feel comfortable and confident expressing themselves exactly as they are. Our updated guidelines incorporate feedback and language used by mental health experts to improve our policies on self-harm and suicide content and avoid normalizing self-injury behaviors. Our policy on eating disorder content has additional considerations to prohibit normalizing or glorifying dangerous weight loss behaviors. We recognize the burden victims of abuse often face in managing their online presence. We've bolstered our policies on bullying and harassment and our guidelines are now more explicit about the types of content and behaviors that aren't welcome on TikTok, including doxxing, cyberstalking, and a more extensive policy against sexual harassment.The safety of everyone in our community is of utmost importance, especially the well-being of youth. In line with our existing dangerous acts policy, we work to either limit, label, or remove content that depicts dangerous acts or challenges. Now, we've added a harmful activities section to our minor safety policy to reiterate that content promoting dangerous dares, games, and other acts that may jeopardize the safety of youth is not allowed on TikTok. We encourage people to be creative and have fun, but not at the expense of an individual's safety, or the safety of others.TikTok stands firmly against violence, both online and off. We've updated our previous dangerous individuals and organizations policy to focus more holistically on the issue of violent extremism. Our guidelines now describe in greater detail what's considered a threat or incitement to violence and the content and behavior we prohibit. As we develop inclusive policies, we continually work to make TikTok more accessible for everyone. We recently announced new tools to support people with photosensitive epilepsy, and we’re starting to roll out a text-to-speech feature that allows people to convert typed text to voice that plays over text as it appears in a video. New resources to support well-being As we navigate challenging subjects like self-harm, compassion for survivors is front of mind. Over the coming week, we'll roll out updated resources to support people who may be struggling. These resources were created with guidance from leading behavioral psychologists and suicide prevention experts, including Providence, Samaritans of Singapore, Live for Tomorrow, and members of our US Content Advisory Council. Now, if someone searches for terms like \"selfharm\" or \"hatemyself\" they'll see evidence-based actions they can take. As before, access to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line are available for those looking for emotional support. We're also introducing opt-in viewing screens on top of videos that some may find graphic or distressing. These types of videos are already ineligible for recommendation into anyone's For You feed, and this feature aims to further reduce unexpected viewing of such content by offering viewers the choice to skip the video or watch it.We continue to develop tools to help people manage their TikTok experience, from automatically filtering unwanted comments to the ability to say \"not interested\" on videos in their For You feed. This is especially important in our efforts to support people who want to share their story and use their voice to raise awareness on topics others may find triggering. Since the start of the pandemic, TikTok has provided access to public health information from experts in our app and relief for frontline workers and families. We're proud when our community comes together through memorable challenges – like #wipeitdown and #happyathome - that connect us and bring joy during difficult times. As COVID-19 vaccines are developed and approved, we're furthering our efforts to support the well-being of our community by making authoritative information about vaccines readily available. At the same time, we continue to remove misinformation about the coronavirus and vaccinations.Over the coming week our in-app coronavirus resource hub will be updated with commonly asked questions and answers about COVID-19 vaccines from public health experts, including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control. Our coronavirus resource hub is accessible from our Discover page, search results, and banners on COVID-19 and vaccine-related videos and has been viewed over 2 billion times globally over the last six months. We're also partnering with Team Halo so that scientists all over the world can share the progress being made on the vaccine through video updates.Educating our community We work to educate and empower our community on our policies through in-app videos, notifications, and safety tools. This month when a user opens up TikTok, they'll be prompted to review these refreshed guidelines. Keeping our community safe is a commitment with no finish line. We recognize the responsibility we have to our users to be nimble in our detection and response when new kinds of content and behaviors emerge. To that end, we'll keep advancing our policies, developing technology to automatically detect violative content, building features that help people manage their TikTok presence and content choices, and empowering our community to help us foster a trustworthy environment. Ultimately, we hope these updates enable people to have a positive and meaningful TikTok experience."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-creators-win-big-at-the-2020-streamy-awards","date":"2020-12-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok creators win big at the 2020 Streamy Awards","text":"Each year, the Streamy Awards shines a spotlight on the accomplishments of creators across the internet.

It's also a place to find your community, no matter your interests. This has never been more important than in 2020. From a global pandemic that introduced us to social distancing to protests for racial equality, community hardships, and personal and economic uncertainties the world over, 2020 was full of all the feelings. Throughout those moments, millions of Americans turned to TikTok to share their stories and lift others up.While the world went through a whirlwind of change this year, one thing hasn't changed: the heart of the TikTok community. With you, we built a deep sense of community and connection even though we’ve spent most of the year physically separated. You continued to impress and inspire millions every day with your creativity and expression. Through the TikTok community we spanned borders and generations, shared laughs and tears, and celebrated life’s best moments. And for that, we now celebrate you. Across the US, you made TikTok the year of everything from cranberry juice-drinking skateboarders, cottagecore fairies, theatre kids, and emerging stars across the music and fashion worlds, to random things that just makes sense like pancake cereal, a goose who throws it back, and carrot bacon. We're here for all of it.\"It's been our honor to watch these videos and creators grow and share what have become iconic, sometimes even life-changing, moments of 2020. TikTok is here to bring joy, and with the year we've experienced, I'm thrilled to take a trip down memory lane and celebrate the myriad of ways the TikTok community helped us come together, bridge divides, and find both lightness and poignancy when we needed it most.\" – Vanessa Pappas, Interim Head of TikTokWith that, we invite you to relive the moments your community shared in together, in this Year on TikTok: Top 100.1) Vibe Check: Top viral videos​Who had cranberry juice on their pandemic bingo card this year? 2020 saw an astounding number of videos go viral, entertaining millions and changing the lives of the creators who made them.

On this Giving Tuesday – a globally recognized day of giving – we're partnering with our community in celebration of #GivingSzn, a monthlong in-app celebration of generosity and goodwill featuring LIVE programming from creators and non-profit organizations, including fundraisers and community-rallying moments.Supporting our community in tangible waysWe've always believed that TikTok can make a positive impact on the world and we're committed to playing our part in bringing that vision to life. To kick off #GivingSzn, today we're announcing a donation of $3 million in funds and $1 million in advertising credits to a diverse group of non-profit organizations that support a range of causes our community cares about. From animal welfare to social justice, world hunger and the environment, the TikTok community is passionate about making the world a better place. The funds provided by TikTok will support these organizations as they raise awareness for their causes and develop educational programs. A full list of the organizations is on our #GivingSzn web page. Tonight, #GivingSzn programming launches with a TikTok LIVE stream fundraiser benefiting American Dance Movement, hosted by Charli D'Amelio. Charli recently made history by becoming the first TikTok creator to reach 100M followers. To celebrate this milestone, we partnered with Charli on the \"Charli D'Amelio Dance Grant\" and donated $100,000 to American Dance Movement. During her LIVE stream, Charli will announce some of the local ADM community programs that will receive the grant and will also build upon the donation through a LIVE fundraiser. Viewers are encouraged to donate through the LIVE donation sticker.Offering our community a new way to give back We're also rolling out donation links in profile that let people raise funds for causes and charities they care about directly from their TikTok profiles. Once a donation link is added to a profile, the organization's name will be featured just below the bio. Tapping on that organization takes viewers to a screen that allows them to make a donation to that organization.The donation link builds upon our efforts to support our community as they use TikTok to make a positive impact on those around them. Earlier this year, we launched TikTok donation stickers to help people raise funds through videos and TikTok LIVE streams. To date, our community can choose from nearly 90 non-profit organizations to support through TikTok. New! Donation Link Spreading the spirit of #GivingSznAs we embark on a month of gratitude and generosity, we're excited to launch programming that not only entertains, but also gives back. #GivingSzn on TikTok connects creators and artists with non-profit organizations, so they can work together to raise awareness and fundraise for causes they're passionate about.Throughout the month, check out the Discover page for the #GivinSzn LIVE programming schedule.

When Doggface208 went viral while drinking juice, Ocean Spray set the standard for how to engage with this type of trending moment. Shortly after this cultural explosion, another brand and TikTok creator found themselves in a viral back and forth on the platform. This time John Casterline, a TikTok creator known as @h1t1, posted a video that features a flat-screen TV he bought for $25 that could only display an Arby’s menu. Casterline's video of the newly acquired Arby's menu quickly spread across TikTok, eventually landing on the radar of Arby's itself, giving the company a chance to engage with this cultural moment. The fast food restaurant acted quickly by sliding into the comments section saying, \"We've been looking for this!\" Videos like these can offer users and brands an opportunity to turn a popular video into a cultural moment with lasting impact, and Arby's did not let the moment pass. \"I remember seeing the original video from John Casterline (@h1t1) at midnight on a Thursday night (social never sleeps!) and wanting to respond with something fun that would set us up for further engagement,\" said Jimmy Beck, Digital & Social Media Supervisor at Arby's, \"Once the comment starting getting traction, we knew this was TikTok gold.\" Arby's continued to drive the momentum of the original video both on and off the TikTok platform, helping to create additional content and progress the story of the Arby's menu TV. The extended back and forth between Arby's and Casterline culminated in the return of the Arby's menu and the launch of a limited \"$5 Missing Menu Meal\" that was available at Arby's from November 6th - 20th. This entertaining series of interactions between Casterline and Arby's eventually became a trend where other creators showed screens that only showed an Arby's menu. This hilarious exchange is just the most recent example in an increasing trend of community engagement from savvy companies looking to reach out to their customers and fans. We're excited to see the creative stunts and videos made that will lead to the next big brand moment."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/miley-cyrus-goes-live-with-tiktoks-watermarked-series","date":"2020-11-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Miley Cyrus going LIVE with TikTok’s “Watermarked” series","text":"Miley will go LIVE on TikTok at 11/26 at 8:30pm PT / 11:30pm ET to preview her new album Plastic Hearts At TikTok, we are proud to be a major source of music discovery for our community, many of whom log on every day in search of their new jam. With Watermarked, our recurring TikTok LIVE series, we team up with artists of all genres to give the TikTok community a first spin of their brand new releases.Watermarked is a live-only listening session, streamed and hosted by the artist, giving TikTok users an opportunity to preview major new releases before they hit streaming services.

True to form for the restlessly creative artist, Miley plans to go above and beyond with her upcoming LIVE stream. This special edition of Watermarked will take fans on an interactive journey inspired by the music and punk-rock-inspired aesthetic of Plastic Hearts, packed with cameos, easter eggs for longtime Miley fans, and excerpts of new songs from the album. Miley’s Watermarked continues a big year for Miley on the TikTok platform. She’s a regular user of TikTok, with more than 6.5 million followers, and her music regularly inspires trends in the TikTok community. Over the summer, Plastic Hearts lead single “Midnight Sky” became a trending hit, generating over 40k video creations. Just last week, Miley used TikTok to preview the music video for “Prisoner,” the latest Plastic Hearts single.But Miley has enraptured the TikTok community with her unmatched ability to make a cover song her own. In September, Miley performed a fierce rendition of Blondie’s “Heart Of Glass” at the iHeart Music Festival, hypnotizing her fans with her rock star attitude, glamorous outfit, and spine-tingling vocal performance. An audio snippet from the performance became a viral TikTok sound, as fans obsessed over her transformation of the classic song. After generating over 30k video creations in just one week, Miley decided to officially release “Heart Of Glass” to streaming services. “Heart Of Glass” now has over 118k total video creations and more than 35 million streams on Spotify alone. Another Miley cover took TikTok by storm in subsequent weeks, when her version of “Why Do You Only Call Me When You’re High” by the Arctic Monkeys soundtracked the viral #MainCharacterChallenge. Originated by @jonysios, the #MainCharacterChallenge provided the vibes for a transition trend that allows TikTok users to unleash their inner divas. With over 420k video creations and over 114 million views on the hashtag, the #MainCharacterChallenge encourages TikTok users to transform from their ordinary selves to their \"main character\" at the moment that Miley's piercing vocal hits. With her upcoming LIVE stream, Miley is taking the opportunity to show her gratitude to the TikTok community for all the love they’ve shown her, and to give them a gift in return. Tune in LIVE to Miley’s @mileycyrus TikTok account at 8:30PM PT/11:30PM ET on November 26th to hear new music from Plastic Hearts and perhaps witness the birth of another challenge or two.Watermarked is the latest installment in an ever-evolving lineup of TikTok LIVE programming that highlight and promote artists’ personal stories.

At the heart of our mission is a commitment to inclusivity because people need to feel safe in order to feel inspired to create.To be a truly inclusive platform we're committed to making TikTok more accessible for everyone, and given the visual nature of our platform we're beginning this work with a series of photosensitivity features. Over the past few months, our team met with epilepsy advocates who shared feedback on how we can improve our platform. Based on these conversations, we launched a feature a few months ago that warns creators when they produce videos with effects that could trigger photosensitive epilepsy. In the coming weeks, we'll be introducing another important accessibility feature to protect people from photosensitive content. With this new feature, viewers who come across a photosensitive video will receive a notification inviting them to \"Skip All\" future photosensitive videos.Epilepsy is a serious condition affecting an estimated 65 million people around the world. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, 1 in 26 people in the United States will develop epilepsy at some point in their life, and 1 in 10 people will have a seizure during their lifetime. Flashing lights or contrasting light and dark patterns can cause people with epilepsy to have seizures. The initial accessibility changes we're making to our platform are designed to make TikTok friendlier for everyone, especially those who live with epilepsy.TikTok is working with a number of leading epilepsy organizations in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, and South Korea, including the Epilepsy Foundation, Epilepsy Toronto, Epilepsy Society, Epilepsy Ireland, Korea Bureau for Epilepsy and the Japan Epilepsy Association, to spread the word about the new feature and bring awareness to epilepsy in general.Our team is committed to serving the needs of everyone in our global community and our long-term goal is to become the most inclusive and accessible online platform. We’re committed to rolling out more product features to support this goal, and look forward to sharing them with you in the months ahead.From our partners:“For people with photosensitive epilepsy, exposure to flashing lights at certain intensities or to certain visual patterns can trigger seizures. While the population of those with photosensitive epilepsy is small, the impact can be quite serious. It is great to see TikTok addressing this issue by making changes to their platform so that people in our epilepsy community can feel protected when viewing content on TikTok. We are proud to have worked with TikTok on this initiative and truly appreciate our continued collaboration.” - Laura Thrall, president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation. \"What some people may not recognize is that for someone living with photosensitive epilepsy, the internet is a particularly difficult and dangerous space to navigate. There is no way to know when you might come across content that contains flashing images or lights that will trigger your seizure, and that’s scary. We are thrilled to hear that TikTok is taking this important step to help make their platform a safer, and more inclusive space for those living with epilepsy.\" - Geoff Bobb, Executive Director, Epilepsy Toronto“Social media can be a lifeline for many people with epilepsy, allowing them to connect with others with the condition from around the world. A downside has increasingly been the number of flashing images and photosensitive content shared either intentionally or maliciously, which could trigger a seizure in those with photosensitive epilepsy. We are delighted that TikTok has recognised this problem and is introducing important new features that will make its platform safer and more accessible for those with epilepsy. We hope that other platforms will follow TikTok’s lead in ensuring greater inclusivity.” - Nicola Swanborough, Acting Head of External Affairs, Epilepsy Society\"At Epilepsy Ireland, our vision is to achieve a society where no person's life is limited by epilepsy. With this photosensitive feature launch, TikTok has taken an important first step towards making social media video content safer and more accessible for millions across the world, including upto 2,000 people in Ireland who live with photosensitive epilepsy. While this is an extremely welcome initiative, many people are not aware that they have this type of epilepsy until they are exposed to a triggering event, so the risks have not been fully eliminated. We look forward to working with TikTok in taking further steps to raise awareness of the potential dangers of flashing video effects. We encourage users of TikTok to use caution when adding effects to videos that may unintentionally cause harm to other users who may have undiagnosed photosensitive epilepsy.\" - Peter Murphy, CEO, Epilepsy Ireland\"We're a public service corporation and we've been working since 1973 to create a society where people with epilepsy and their families can live in peace. In Japan, it is estimated that there are approximately one million people who live with epilepsy. Epilepsy is a cranial nerve disease that can affect anyone from infants to the elderly. About 70% of people with epilepsy can stabilize their condition with medication, but there also are people left with symptoms which are hard to cure. The number of people with photosensitive epilepsy is as low as 1 in 4,000, but the frequency becomes much higher if latent photosensitive people who are unaware of their own condition are included. We applaud TikTok's thoughtful efforts to ensure that those with photosensitive epilepsy can enjoy videos in a safe environment, and we're honored to work with their team.\" - Satomi Umemoto, President of the Japan Epilepsy Association\"Recently, the video platform market has grown remarkably. TikTok, which is accessible to everyone, already has many users and creators in Korea. We thank TikTok for its efforts to make video content safe for epilepsy by launching photosensitivity features for epilepsy patients. The Korea Bureau for Epilepsy is trying to solve the psychological and social difficulties of some 370,000 people with epilepsy and their families. We will develop various contents related to epilepsy with TikTok so that it can be helpful to many people.\" - MD, PhD Kim, Heung Dong, President of the Korea Bureau for Epilepsy\"As the preeminent international network organisation with members in more than 100 countries worldwide, the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) has a vision of the world where everywhere ignorance and fear about epilepsy are replaced by understanding and care. IBE therefore welcomes the new photosensitive warning introduced by TikTok that will help to prevent people with this type of epilepsy from unnecessary exposure to seizure risk. With more than 50 million people living with epilepsy, six million of whom are in Europe, we support any initiative that can minimise triggers that can cause seizures, in order to reduce the discrimination to which people with epilepsy are so often exposed and to ensure the best possible quality of life for those living with a diagnosis epilepsy.” - Ann Little, Executive Director at International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE)"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/congratulations-charli-damelio-for-100-million-followers-paving-the-way-for-creators-everywhere","date":"2020-11-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Congratulations Charli for 100M followers, paving the way for creators everywhere","text":"TikTok is home to hundreds of millions of people, from dancers, teachers, and comedians to artists, postal workers, delivery drivers, and more.

Take a deeper look at content form this trend in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects. Current Top Trend: #OhNoA combination of music and impending disaster dominated TikTok this week as incredible failures and surgically-cut reactions sparked the #OhNo trend.The earliest rendition of the trend popped up in early September with a series of Gaming videos. Creators uploaded gameplay footage depicting the moment before a player lands a perfect sniper shot, set to a song from rapper Capone, titled \"Oh No.\" With each video, the frame would freeze just before the shot landed and the lyrics \"oh no\" were sung.Over time, this trend expanded outside of Gaming, as users followed the same format to show their own real life disasters. In each of these IRL examples, users followed the same cues: Capone's track, the freeze frame, and the pixelated zoom.Particularly notable is the creation flow required for these videos. While they seem relatively straightforward, they do implement a variety of TikTok features, including Green Screen, Green Screen Video, and additional in-app editing tricks.This trend shows how TikTok's many notable niche communities can interact with one another through trends. The fact that this trend started in Gaming is more evidence of the constant interaction, reinterpretation, and cross-pollination that exists within the fluid interests of TikTok's users. Notable Video Hot Track: Ice Dance (From \"Edward Scissorhands\")Ashton Gleckman's \"Ice Dance\" provides a dreamy sound that has driven a trend on TikTok where users turn themselves into a Tim Burton character with the help of the Time Warp Scan effect. Even if they aren't taking part in the trend, this sound sets the tone for many different styles of video from stories to pet footage. Hot Effect: Green Screen Eyes and MouthCreators can give anything a personality with this new, hilarious effect. Creator Spotlight: @lifeofadoctorDr. Fayez, a healthcare professional, has quickly gained a dedicated following since starting his TikTok journey in fall of 2019.

That's why we regularly speak to parents and teens and work with family and youth experts to develop meaningful ways for parents to support their teens on TikTok. Our aim is to strike a balance between safety and autonomy for teenagers as we work to create a safe and supportive place for self-expression. With that in mind, earlier this year we introduced Family Pairing, which lets parents link their TikTok account to their teen's to enable a variety of content and privacy settings. We've now expanded this feature to give parents greater oversight and families a more robust set of tools to create the TikTok experience that's right for them. Using Family Pairing, parents can help guide their teen's browsing experience with the following controls: Search [NEW]: Decide whether your teen can search for content, users, hashtags, or soundsScreen Time Management: Set how long your teen can spend on TikTok each dayRestricted Mode: Limit the appearance of content that may not be appropriate for a general audience in your teen's For You feedAs young people start to build a presence online, we believe it's important to give families tools so parents and teens can set guardrails together. Our expanded Family Pairing feature now includes:Comments [NEW]: Decide who can comment on your teen's videos (everyone, friends, no one)Discoverability [NEW]: Decide whether your teen's account is private (your teen decides who can see their content) or public (anyone can search and view content)Liked Videos [NEW]: Many people enjoy finding new videos to watch that others they follow have also enjoyed, but this control empowers families to decide whether others can see the list of videos your teen has likedDirect Messages: Restrict who can send messages to your teen, or turn off direct messaging completely. With user safety in mind, we also have many policies and controls on messaging. For example, direct messaging is automatically disabled for those under 16, only approved followers can message each other, and images and videos cannot be sent in messages. Every family is different. Some may choose to use Family Pairing only when their teen starts on TikTok; others may choose to stay connected to their teen's account for longer; and even without Family Pairing enabled, teens can always take advantage of these tools by selecting them individually through their app settings. Whatever parents and teens decide is right for them, we hope Family Pairing will encourage families to have broader conversations about digital safety.In the US, we accommodate those under the age of 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a view-only experience with curated content and additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for an under-13 audience. In this ecosystem, users can experience and make fun, creative, and even educational videos but cannot post those videos, comment on others' videos, message with others, or maintain a profile or followers.In addition to our tools for families, we continue to strengthen our youth safety and well-being policies. For instance, we recently added more guidelines and resources to support body positivity in our community, and we remove harmful content like hateful ideologies.We've also developed global partnerships to protect against child exploitation as we remove such content, terminate accounts, and report cases the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement. Protecting minors – online and offline – is vitally important and requires collaboration between platforms, governments, and child safety organizations. That's why we've endorsed implementation of the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, which offers a framework that can be consistently applied across digital sectors and services to respond to changing behaviors and protect young people.For families who want to learn more about online safety, we've created a number of resources, including our Youth Portal, Parents page, educational safety videos, and more. We're committed to the safety of our community – especially youth – on TikTok and will continue to develop resources, tools, and policies as we aim for the highest level of safety."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-a-coming-of-age-story","date":"2020-11-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: A coming of age story","text":"TikTok users celebrate their #ComingOfAge with a spoof of teen movies! Take a deeper look at content form this trend in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects. Current Top Trend: #ComingOfAgeThe TikTok community recently grew fond of a specific song to help share their own #ComingOfAge story.Centered around the aptly named track, \"Coming of Age\" from English group, Blondes, the trend will make sense as soon as you listen to the song. The song's dreamy guitar riff sounds like a relic from teen-oriented movies from the 1990s and 2000s and has provided the perfect backdrop for the TikTok community to shoot their own comedic short films.Creators shared videos covering everything from small-town kids dreaming of the world, to main characters being a bit too talented, and shorts poking fun at teen makeovers.The coming of age trend is another example of how a comedic premise centered around a song that provokes an image and memory can quickly inspire people to create TikTok gold. By using nostalgia as a catalyst, the #ComingOfAge trend offers a solid template for creators to use as a jumping off point for different takes on the video concept. From family photographs, to relaunching classic songs, the TikTok community loves to not only reminisce, but bring back old classics. Notable Video Hot Track: Where is the Love?TikTok brought back the classic Black Eyed Peas song, \"Where is the Love\" to play as the soundtrack for a new trend. The trend shows users hopping away to complete a task or fulfill a request. Their hops line up in time with the song's catchy melody creating an easily replicated trend that gives us all a reason to turn up the volume. Hot Effect: 3D Green Screen3D Green Screen offers creators even more versatility in how they use a favorite creative effect. Creator Spotlight: PB HerePBHere, an animated, interactive alternate reality game on TikTok, has grown into an engrossing account since their first post on October 24th. The concept of the series is that PB, an animated character, is trapped in a small room with no memory of how he got there. He has access to the outside world only through his cell phone, and the TikTok community has been helping him navigate his way out in the comment sections since his very first video.

And while TikTok isn't an app built around political debates or real-time news, we want to make sure we're supporting our community with access to authoritative information if they're having relevant conversations in our app. Today we're announcing additions to our existing in-app election guide, and sharing more on how our policies apply to content and accounts leading up to Election Day and beyond. Stopping the spread of misleading information Our misleading content policies prohibit misinformation, disinformation, and manipulated media, and at the beginning of the month we launched an Elections Safety Center to increase transparency into how our policies apply to a range of potential scenarios. For instance, we remove content that seeks to intimidate voters or suppress voting, and we do not tolerate content or accounts that seek to incite violence. We've also detailed how we work closely with fact-checking partners – who are on expedited call during this sensitive time – to assess the accuracy of content so we can quickly remove false or manipulated videos. With heightened focus around Election Day, we'll be partnering with these fact checkers to reduce discoverability of content that prematurely claims victory in a race before results are confirmed by The Associated Press. Out of an abundance of caution, if claims can't be verified or fact-checking is inconclusive, we'll limit distribution of the content. We'll also add a banner pointing viewers to our election guide on content with unverifiable claims about voting, premature declarations of victory, or attempts to dissuade people from voting by exploiting COVID-19 as a voter suppression tactic.For more information about our elections policies and approach, visit our Election Safety Center. Election Day resources Starting November 3, we'll add new, timely resources to the election guide we introduced last month. For questions about polling locations or hours, state voter registration requirements, and more, we'll provide access to the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC) website.We'll also provide the Election Protection Hotline number in case our community experiences voting difficulties, available in English, Spanish, Asian languages, and Arabic, and a video call option for American Sign Language.The majority of content people see on TikTok comes through their For You feed, which shows videos regardless of when they were posted. That's why we're working with the AP to provide access to their interactive map which shows live results for races for the US president, Congress, governor, and ballot initiatives at the federal and state levels from our election guide. This way viewers will be able to easily consult up-to-date results regardless of when they watch the video.In addition, people can reference commonly asked questions and answers from the National Association of Secretaries of State to learn about the voting process, including voting by mail or in-person, how election results are compiled, and what to expect during the counting process. Our election guide can be accessed via our Discover page, election-related search results, and on videos relating to the elections or posted by verified political accounts.Millions of Americans come to TikTok to express their creative side and connect with others.

Our policies are driven by our mission to inspire creativity and bring joy to people around the world. They help us foster an inclusive and authentic community and define the kind of content and behavior that's not allowed on our app. For the past few months, we've been experimenting with a new notification system to bring creators more clarity around content removals. Our goals are to enhance the transparency and education around our Community Guidelines to reduce misunderstandings about content on our platform, and the results have been promising. Explaining our enforcement actions while reminding people of our policies has helped reduce the rate of repeat violations, and visits to our Community Guidelines have nearly tripled. We've also seen a 14 percent reduction in requests from users to appeal a video's removal. We believe this helps foster greater understanding of the kind of positive content and welcoming behavior that makes our community thrive. With these results in mind, we've rolled out our improved notifications to our community globally. Now, when a video is removed for violating our policies, we'll let the video’s creator know which policy was violated in leading to the removal and provide the video creator with the ability to appeal the decision. By being more transparent with our content enforcement, we aim to ensure that our Community Guidelines are enforced uniformly and evenly.We're also working to support our community through these notifications. For instance, when content is flagged as self-harm or suicide-related, we'll provide access to expert resources through a second notification. Being transparent with our community is key to continuing to earn and maintain trust.

On TikTok, one creator’s vibe can inspire a resonant moment across pop culture, spreading from the TikTok community to the rest of the Internet and IRL world. Enter Nathan Apodaca, a long time TikTok creator using the handle @420doggface208. Combining the unlikely ingredients of skateboarding, cranberry juice, and the classic jam “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac, Nathan’s “morning vibe” took the internet by storm, growing into a heart-warming moment and changing his life forever. On September 25th, Nathan's car broke down on the way to work, so he hopped on his board to keep from being late. Unfazed by his predicament, the Idaho native made a fateful decision, making a now-famous TikTok to commemorate his supernatural zen. Without stopping his skateboard commute, Nathan took swigs of cran-raspberry juice straight from the bottle (Ocean Spray, if you're wondering), while singing the lyrics to “Dreams.” The video immediately grabbed the attention of the TikTok community, earning millions of views before jumping to other social platforms through multiple viral posts. As people watched Nathan coast down the road on his skateboard, they were inspired to grab their own bottle of Ocean Spray and pay tribute to the original with a video of their own. From there, the trend Nathan started continued to rise in popularity with creators and celebrities continuing to recreate the vibey video, spreading positivity with each new rendition. With average daily uses of “Dreams” in TikTok videos up 1,380% since the trend began on September 25th and videos made by all types of creators from Jimmy Fallon to the Ocean Spray CEO, it’s clear that this trend resonated with the creator community. Nathan's mesmerizing video eventually grew big enough to reach Fleetwood Mac themselves, who responded from their Twitter account. The moment reached even greater heights when Fleetwood Mac co-founder Mick Fleetwood joined TikTok and posted his own rendition of the popular video on October 1st, which gained a quarter of the views Nathan's original video received in just a single day. Mick's video led to a heartfelt interaction with Nathan in the comments, where the pair agreed to meet up in person once it was safe to do so.In response to the uplifting moment and trend, Mick Fleetwood said, “It’s been such a wonderful surprise to see that TikTok has been able to bring some joy in challenging times as well as encourage creativity among so many young people. To see our fans or even people just learning about the band embrace Fleetwood Mac has been so inspirational and meaningful to us.”Nathan’s unique vibe quickly translated into a resurgence in popularity for Fleetwood Mac, with “Dreams” receiving a 374% jump in sales and a 89% jump in streams, putting the classic hit back on Billboard's top charts. After Mick Fleetwood made his video, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 #21 after a 43-year absence, and climbed to the Top Ten of Spotify’s Global and U.S. charts and hit #1 on Apple Music. It reached #1 on Billboard's Rock Digital Song Sales and #3 on Billboard's Rock Streaming Songs charts, showing the power of a trend to give classic songs new life and helping artists reach a new generation of fans. Nathan’s viral success has had an amazing effect on his own life as well. Ocean Spray, the company behind the cran-raspberry concoction in the video, found customers had cleared their products off of store shelves. They reached out and generously provided Nathan a new truck to replace the car that had broken down moments before the now famous video was filmed. In addition to the gift from Ocean Spray, Nathan has received donations from fans which he plans to put towards a down payment on a house (he currently lives in an RV near his brother's home in Idaho Falls). Nathan has used this moment to release a new line of merchandise commemorating the event and even wound up as the face of a national TikTok TV commercial, which aired during the NBA Finals. Nathan's story is a perfect example of how TikTok can be a catalyst for life changing moments. A TikTok can bring a smile to the faces of millions, connect artists with fans, help others through a hard time, and completely reshape the lives of creators and fans. Nathan's original video has sparked remakes and tributes from fans and shown how TikTok is starting point for trends that take over the entire internet. The way in which this trend accelerated and reached popular culture as a whole is due in large part to social platforms sharing Nathan's content, spreading what is trending within our community, to other entertainment outlets.As Nathan continues his journey, we're excited to see how his positive vibes continue to impact his life and the TikTok community as a whole. And as always, we'll continue to watch and encourage the TikTok community to create the next life changing trend. Meanwhile, the “Dreams” resurgence on TikTik and beyond shows no signs of slowing down. Just yesterday, iconic Fleetwood Mac singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks joined TikTok! The song’s original writer, and the woman whose voice has inspired thousands of lip syncs, Stevie’s first TikTok showed off her “afternoon vibe,” displaying her genuine appreciation for Nathan and the community, as she laced up her roller skates with a half-full jug of cranberry juice in the background."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/thats-a-wrap-a-look-back-at-the-first-ever-tiktokfashionmonth","date":"2020-10-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"That’s a wrap!

TikTok is known for offering musicians and artists a chance to show their talents and collaborate with one another through the duet feature. When one creator makes a video showcasing a unique song they've written, it's common for other artists to add their own twist or harmony to bring the piece to a new level. This ability to build on art is one of the reasons content on TikTok is unique, engaging and diverse. The musical theater community has stepped into center stage with this format by creating elaborate, multi-part harmonies that are good enough for Broadway - or at least Broadway stars.Each musical collaboration starts with a creator who writes and performs an original song that catches the attention of the community. The original is followed by several duets that each take the song in a unique direction. From there the duet can stay as it is or grow into a multipart masterpiece with each new singer adding a different aspect to the song. That's how a song can go from being a simple duet. To a quartet To having over 10 parts. And if singers don't feel like writing, they can always sing duets with their favorite Broadway songs.

It's an opportunity to think about our own emotional wellbeing and also support others who might be struggling. We're inspired to see our TikTok community share their creativity, thoughts, and personal expression – including their mental health. From stories, to hashtags of support and kind comments, TikTok is a community that cares for each other. This year, we're excited to partner with Diplo for a 1 hour meditative music experience with Secular Sabbath, Rhye, and other surprises. This exclusive experience will raise funds for The JED Foundation – an organization that empowers teens and young adults with the skills and support to grow into healthy, thriving adults. During the LIVE stream, viewers can show their support by tapping on the LIVE room banner to submit a donation without having to leave the app. Donations are powered by Tiltify, a charitable fundraising platform, which processes donation transactions through their platform.\"Mental health is something we don't speak enough about, but it's something we all need to get better at,\" said Diplo. \"This year is hard. We're more isolated than ever, due to social distancing. If you are struggling or have a friend or family member who is, you may not know how to begin a conversation - but there are great resources to help you make a difference.\" We recognize that having conversations about mental health, or asking for help, can be really hard for some. So we've partnered with several leading mental health advocacy organizations to help bring their message to TikTok as a way to foster ongoing conversations around emotional wellbeing. Those partners include: The JED Foundation, The Trevor Project, Providence Health and Seize the Awkward to share tips, resources and conversation starters.The Seize the Awkward movement provides conversation starters and tips to help you help those who may be struggling with their mental health. \"In times of uncertainty, like during this extended Covid-19 period, connecting with friends and family can really help in managing feelings of fear and anxiety, and be good for your health. You don't need to be there, to be there for a friend,\" said Heidi Arthur, Chief Campaign Development Officer at the Ad Council. The Jed Foundation (JED) protects the emotional health and prevents suicide for teens and young adults. Their JED Voices and Storytellers series showcase how anyone can be affected by mental health issues — including some of your favorite Olympians, actors and musicians. \"We know one of the best ways to help people is through their friends and family, and this is why we provide resources to teach young people to help themselves and their loved ones. We are excited to launch our TikTok account and will continue to share tips to the community,\" said Erica Riba, Director, Higher Education & Student Engagement at JED. Providence Health's Work2BeWell program provides free curriculum, resources, and implementation tools to make an impact as a student mental health advocate, educator, or parent. \"One of our greatest assets as a community is each other — that's why we're so excited to work with TikTok's amazing creators including Hana Giraldo, Notorious Cree, Kyle Massey, Adam Waheed and many others to share wellbeing tips,' said Mary Renouf, Associate Vice President Social and Influencer Strategy. Learning about the tactics to reset and hearing from each other can help break the stigma and begin the dialog.\" The Trevor Project is the world's largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer & questioning (LGBTQ) young people. Their research shows that acceptance can save lives, and that supportive environments — including some found on online platforms like TikTok — can be valuable to LGBTQ youth. The organization educates people on how to prevent suicide in their lives by using C.A.R.E., a simple tool to respond to the possible warning signs for suicide that you might notice in someone else. \"Affirming LGBTQ young people and their identities can positively impact their mental health and help prevent suicide. You can use C.A.R.E. in your daily lives to help prevent suicide, and remember that The Trevor Project will always be here to support LGBTQ youth in crisis, 24/7,\" said Shane Michael Singh, Corporate Development Manager at The Trevor Project. Social distancing may continue to keep us physically apart but it doesn't mean we are alone. We invite everyone to continue sharing your stories to help fight the stigma, educate our community, and advocate for each other by using the hashtag #MentalHealthMatters.

Take a deeper look at content form this trend in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects. Current Top Trend: #YouHaveToLet's take a look back at a trend that dominated the TikTok ecosystem for a few weeks, as users offered advice that was at times heartfelt, but consistently sarcastic.Motivational videos have been a force online for years, and typically follow a general format: someone speaks directly to camera, and sends a message to the viewer while dramatic music plays in the background. In February of this year, this format became especially popular on TikTok after user @hannah_harpist uploaded a harp cover of ODESZA song, \"A Moment Apart.\" Initially, this audio was used in a variety of video formats, from nostalgic video memories to transformations over time. This all changed when user @ashlaward uploaded a video on May 26th set to @hannah_harpist's audio and encouraged users to start romanticizing their lives. Of course, TikTok eventually turned the motivational theme into a humorous one. On September 2nd, user @stanzipotenta uploaded a parody of Ashley's original video where she showed the need for users to embrace their dark side. A few days later, user @notthomas uploaded a video encouraging users to stop being scared of kids at mall, making use of all of the structural characteristics that would define subsequent videos: the distorted audio, the Creative Effect, Hannah's backing track, and the sarcastic recommendations. In just five days, the trend was born.This trend shows how content on TikTok often references older videos and inside jokes. Callbacks happen constantly, and this is just the latest example of a vintage trend resurfacing. Notable Video Hot Track: Dreams (2004 Remaster)One of the things that's unique to TikTok is it's ability to give classic songs a new life through trends and viral videos. Fleetwood Mac's \"Dreams\" has become the track of choice for skateboarding juice lovers across the world after @420doggface208's viral video brought the song back to the forefront of pop culture. Mick Fleetwood even joined TikTok to hop in on the trend! Hot Effect: Color CustomizerThe color customizer allows users to change the color scheme of their videos, leading to amazing visual effects and jaw dropping videos. Creator Spotlight: @onlyjayus Isabella Avila, aka @onlyjayus, recently graduated with a degree in computer science and math and moved to Los Angeles to take her creator career to the next level and pursue it as a full time job. Her videos surrounding facts and psychology erupted on the platform, and she was one of the inaugural 2020 LGBTQI+ TikTok Trailblazers.

We've seen our community inspire trends and start movements by showing up as their true selves -- telling stories of joy, humor, courage and honesty. This opportunity to spark joy by being your authentic self is not isolated to creators, brands are recognizing the value of realness as well.As we’ve seen time and time again, brands play an important role in the TikTok experience, and our community enjoys engaging with the brands they love. The experience is not about advertising, it’s connection, inspiration, co-creation, and entertainment. This allows brands to be real and part of the culture creation happening on TikTok because they show up as members of the community.Every day we see millions of users adding to the diversity of content and range of human expressions on TikTok. What separates the brands who are losing relevance and those that are succeeding is the mindset to think beyond traditional marketing tactics and focus on new initiatives to creatively engage and connect with users through feelings, actions and sound.In a new U.S. study we commissioned from Nielsen, we're uncovering the most significant insights about the value of authenticity in community and marketing and how brands can shift their storytelling in order to meaningfully engage new audiences. \"Being real is the new cultural currency as today’s influence comes from the authentic ideas and imagination of everyday people,\" said Sofia Hernandez, Head of U.S. Business Marketing, TikTok. \"This opens up a new opportunity for brands to take a more meaningful approach to marketing by truly connecting with our community. Trends on TikTok create moments and movements that extend off the platform and become part of our daily lives; and this type of engagement and relevance are what brands continue to strive for.\"The following are the top takeaways from the report.The power of communityPeople don't have to be perfect, and that's perfect.

In the study, TikTok was the only app where “to lift my spirits\" was a top reason for using it. Nearly 3 out of every 4 users who felt positive said that they felt inspired, confident, and entertained while using TikTok.61% of TikTok users feel that advertising on TikTok is unique from top social and video platforms. Users also associated the advertising on TikTok with being more authentic, fun, genuine, honest, real and trustworthy compared to other channels. 43% of heavy TikTok users feel that the “advertising” on TikTok blends in with the content. Discovery and connectionTikTok is a dynamic platform and allows for constant discovery. This allows for brands to be relevant and discovered in the same. TikTok is an open platform where anyone and any brand can be discovered. TikTok users enjoy the discovery of new and relatable content.Over half of users are engaged in activities like saving sound clips and searching through hashtags. Additionally, 79% of users mentioned they take the time to read the comments on videos.88% of TikTok users said that they discover new content that they enjoy while using the app, and about half of users said they discover new products through advertisements posted by a product or brand. We are humbled to see our users showing up as the most honest version of themselves, and we are proud to enable and provide a platform for that authentic self-expression. What TikTok offers brands has never been available before - a place to truly become part of the fabric of culture through authenticity.

By using the platform as a new way to connect with fans through engaging and joyful content, NASCAR has captured the attention of over 735K followers - bringing the community together to cheer on their favorite drivers in a unique way. Today, we're excited to give our community and racing fans across the country another reason to celebrate their favorite American pastime by announcing TikTok as the official sponsor of up-and-coming NASCAR driver and TikTok creator, Ryan Vargas. TikTok will be Ryan's first major sponsorship deal to help catapult his career, further giving him a platform to tell his story. Diversity is core to TikTok, and finding new ways to amplify and support diverse voices from our community is an important part of who we are and how we aim to give back to our incredible community. In addition to the launch of our Latinx Heritage Month programming, where we're celebrating and honoring the cultures and contributions of the TikTok Latinx community, this partnership with Ryan Vargas and NASCAR is yet another way for TikTok to show up for and support a young creator from an underrepresented community. As a part of this partnership for the 2020 season, racing fans can see Ryan Vargas step onto the track in a custom TikTok suit and Dia De Los Muertos helmet (a special tribute to his Hispanic heritage) as he heads off to race in his Number 6 car fully wrapped in TikTok branding.Ryan Vargas' CarThe 20-year-old alumnus of NASCAR's 'Drive for Diversity' program is an authentic TikTok fan and user, capturing the attention of over 40K users on the platform. From showing footage of past race victories to acting out comical NASCAR humor, Ryan showcases the joy of racing in an inclusive and inspirational way to the TikTok community. Ryan Vargas' SuitAfter a year filled with cancelled sporting events, racing fans are anxiously awaiting the return of NASCAR's fast-paced, rubber burning action. NASCAR and TikTok will partner together in several co-marketing opportunities to further amplify Ryan's story and bring the excitement of racing to a broader audience.“We’re thrilled to see a platform like TikTok make such a significant investment in our sport, especially with a young rising star like Ryan Vargas,” said NASCAR Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, Tim Clark. “Ryan’s familiarity with the platform makes him a great fit for the brand, and we look forward to continue working with TikTok to showcase the excitement of NASCAR racing to a wide and highly-engaged audience.”  “TikTok has provided me with an incredible outlet to reach new fans and demographics through fun and creative content, and I've seen the highest growth in followers on TikTok over my other social channels.,\" says NASCAR driver, Ryan Vargas. \"The opportunity to run the #6 TikTok Chevrolet Camaro in the NASCAR Xfinity Series for the rest of the season is an absolute dream come true. The Johnny Davis Motorsports team took a chance on me last year and I’m excited to bring this amazing TikTok partnership their way. I wouldn’t want to make this partnership a reality anywhere else.\"“Creators of all sizes and backgrounds show up to TikTok with their genuine, authentic selves” said Nick Tran, Head of Global Marketing at TikTok. “Partnering with an iconic brand like NASCAR to sponsor Ryan Vargas on his racing journey is a way for us to continue to support, celebrate and elevate the diverse creators that make our TikTok community what it is today.

We're inspired by seeing our community lift each other up, lend support during challenging times, and celebrate the unique qualities that make us all who we are. These daily moments of empathy across our community help make TikTok feel incredibly unique and special.As a society, weight stigma and body shaming pose both individual and cultural challenges, and we know that the internet, if left unchecked, has the risk of exacerbating such issues. That's why we're focused on working to safeguard our community from harmful content and behavior while supporting an inclusive – and body-positive – environment.We want to share some of the steps we're taking in this regard, including nurturing the ways in which a global community like ours can help those who may be struggling find support, affirmation, and empathy from those around them. Improving our ad policies on weight loss and dieting productsBrands play an integral role on our platform, and our advertising policies are developed to help establish parameters for the ad content within that community experience. To that end, we're introducing new ad policies that ban ads for fasting apps and weight loss supplements, and increase restrictions on ads that promote a harmful or negative body image. These types of ads do not support the positive, inclusive, and safe experience we strive for on TikTok. Additionally, we're introducing new ad policies to combat problematic and exaggerated claims in diet and weight loss products, and placing stronger restrictions on weight loss claims and references to body image. These policies include:Weight management products can only reach users age 18+Stronger restrictions on weight loss and implied weight loss claimsFurther restrictions to limit irresponsible claims made by products that promote weight loss management or controlAds promoting weight loss and weight management products or services cannot promote a negative body image or negative relationship with foodBuilding community partnerships and resourcesTikTok is proud to partner with the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) to connect users looking for support to important resources, directly from our app. As part of this, we'll soon begin redirecting searches and hashtags – for terms provided to us by NEDA, or associated with unsafe content we've removed from our platform – to the NEDA Helpline, where NEDA can then provide our community with confidential support, tools, and resources.In addition, TikTok will be supporting Weight Stigma Awareness Week (September 28 - October 2) by launching a dedicated page in our app to support NEDA's #EndWeightHateCampaign. This page will be featured in our Discover tab and will educate our community about what weight stigma is, why it should matter to everyone, and how they can find support or support others who may be struggling.TikTok partner and National Eating Disorders Association CEO Claire Mysko said: \"We are encouraged to see a prominent platform like TikTok join the movement to End Weight Hate and challenge fatphobia. Weight stigma has been documented as a significant risk factor for depression, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem. Research shows that those who experience weight-based stigmatization are at an increased risk for eating disorder symptoms. Weight stigma and discrimination harms all of us. Social media is a powerful tool to create safe and inclusive spaces where all bodies are accepted and celebrated.\"Putting controls into the hands of our usersTo support community members who might be struggling with weight stigma or an eating disorder, we offer a number of in-app controls to manage your TikTok experience, including:Reporting: If you come across ads or content that promote harmful behaviors or imagery, you can report it by long pressing on the video, selecting \"report,\" and choosing \"self-harm\"Not interested: If you come across content that might be triggering or upsetting to you, long-press on the video, select \"not interested,\" and choose to hide future videos from the creator or hide videos that use the same soundComment filters: We offer two ways to quickly and easily filter comments you don't want to see. In the Privacy section of our app settings, select \"comment filters.\" The first option automatically hides offensive comments our systems detect on your videos; the second options lets you create a custom list of keywords so that comments containing those words will be hidden automatically, too.Blocking: If you're experiencing unkind behavior from a member of our community, you can block and report them directly from their profile so that they can't find or engage with your content TikTok creator and body positivity advocate, Anna O'Brien (@glitterandlazers), said: \"These changes to the ad policies make me feel safer, more welcome and prouder to be a TikTok creator. Diet culture isn't welcome on TikTok, because diverse voices are.\" Though there's always more work we can do in this critical area, we think these are steps in the right direction. We continue to look for new ways to support our community and foster a positive environment for everyone on TikTok."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-h-1-2020-transparency-report","date":"2020-09-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Our H1 2020 Transparency Report","text":"By Michael Beckerman, VP, Head of US Public Policy & Eric Han, Head of Safety, TikTok USToday we released our global Transparency Report for the first six months of 2020.

It's why we release these reports to hold ourselves accountable to our community and provide transparency into the actions we take to help keep TikTok safe for everyone. It's the reason we opened our global Transparency and Accountability Centers, where lawmakers and experts can see first-hand how we moderate content, secure our platform, and prioritize user safety and content diversity as we build TikTok. At our physical centers, we've even made TikTok's source code available for testing and evaluation by experts.Hundreds of millions of people around the world come to TikTok for entertainment, self-expression, and connection. Our focus remains on promoting a safe app experience that fosters joy and belonging among our growing global community. Here's what's covered in our global H1 2020 Transparency Report. Promoting safety and community on TikTok In the first half of 2020 we made numerous improvements in our continuous strive to offer a safe and uplifting experience for people on our platform. we expanded our Community Guidelines, including new policies to counter misinformation and disinformationwe introduced fact-checking programs to help us verify misleading content about the novel coronavirus, elections, and morewe added in-app educational PSAs on hashtags related to important topics in the public discourse, such as COVID-19, the elections, Black Lives Matter, and harmful conspiracies, such as QAnonwe launched Family Pairing, a suite of industry-leading youth safety features that let parents and guardians connect their TikTok account to their teens' accounts to guide the type of content available to their teen, promote healthy screentime habits, and choose appropriate message settingswe built global partnerships with leading safety organizations, such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and WePROTECT Global Alliancewe created a Content Advisory Council of experts on topics like hate speech, inclusive AI, and youth safetyCommunity Guidelines enforcement TikTok has experienced incredible and continued user growth in 2020. As more of our lives moved online, people increasingly found meaningful ways to connect with each other on our platform. With significantly more content being created by our global community than ever before, our content removals have increased compared to our last report. 104,543,719 videos were removed globally for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, which is less than 1% of all videos uploaded on TikTok.

The report provides insight into the ways we work to keep TikTok safe and uplifting for everyone. To hold ourselves accountable to our community as we build trust through transparency, we regularly share information about the content we remove, including hate speech, misinformation, and other topics that violate our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service. Our commitment to keeping our users safe encompasses a broad effort which also includes features like Family Pairing, which we built to give parents better coordination with their teens; resources and education for our community, like our Youth Portal or educational safety videos; and industry partnerships we forge to collaborate and learn from others like the WePROTECT Global Alliance. Social and content platforms are continually challenged by the posting and cross-posting of harmful content, and this affects all of us – our users, our teams, and the broader community. As content moves from one app to another, platforms are sometimes left with a whack-a-mole approach when unsafe content first comes to them. Technology can help auto-detect and limit much but not all of that, and human moderators and collaborative teams are often on the frontlines of these issues. Each individual effort by a platform to safeguard its users would be made more effective through a formal, collaborative approach to early identification and notification amongst companies. Such collaboration is already happening when it comes to certain content most people agree are dangerous or harmful, such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM). But there's a critical need to work together to protect people from extremely violent, graphic content, including suicide. To that end, yesterday TikTok's interim head, Vanessa Pappas, sent a letter to the heads of nine social and content platforms proposing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that would encourage companies to warn one another of such violent, graphic content on their own platforms. By working together and creating a hashbank for violent and graphic content, we could significantly reduce the chances of people encountering it and enduring the emotional harm that viewing such content can bring – no matter the app they use. There is nothing more important to us than the safety of our community. Bringing joy and connection to our global community is the ultimate goal, and prioritizing the well-being of the people in that community is paramount to that. We believe other platforms share this goal. We are committed to working with others across the industry, as well as experts, academics, and non-profit organizations as we develop a framework and plan to bring this group to fruition. Our users deserve it. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The following letter was sent to the heads of nine social and content platforms.Recently, social and content platforms have once again been challenged by the posting and cross-posting of explicit suicide content that has affected all of us – as well as our teams, users, and broader communities. Like each of you, we worked diligently to mitigate its proliferation by removing the original content and its many variants, and curtailing it from being viewed or shared by others. However, we believe each of our individual efforts to safeguard our own users and the collective community would be boosted significantly through a formal, collaborative approach to early identification and notification amongst industry participants of extremely violent, graphic content, including suicide. To this end, we would like to propose the cooperative development of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will allow us to quickly notify one another of such content. Separately, we are conducting a thorough analysis of the events as they relate to the recent sharing of suicide content, but it's clear that early identification allows platforms to more rapidly respond to suppress highly objectionable, violent material.We are mindful of the need for any such negotiated arrangement to be clearly defined with respect to the types of content it could capture, and nimble enough to allow us each to move quickly to notify one another of what would be captured by the MOU. We also appreciate there may be regulatory constraints across regions that warrant further engagement and consideration.To this end, we would like to convene a meeting of our respective Trust and Safety teams to further discuss such a mechanism, which we believe will help us all improve safety for our users.We look forward to your positive response and working together to help protect our users and the wider community.Sincerely,Vanessa PappasHead of TikTok"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-for-our-tiktok-family","date":"2020-09-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"An update for our TikTok family","text":"By Vanessa Pappas, Interim Head of TikTokWhen I joined TikTok nearly two years ago, few Americans had heard of it. The marketplace of online social platforms had remained virtually unchanged for a decade. Few could have imagined TikTok would become a social phenomenon that would change the lives of hundreds of millions of people. In the process, TikTok has altered the competitive tech landscape, spurring companies across the industry to innovate. And at TikTok, we're just getting started.TikTok has always been unique from other platforms. The app gives our community excitingly simple tools with which to foster their creativity and power their entertaining short-form videos. Our For You feed, where you first land upon opening the app, offers up videos based on your unique interests and has changed the way companies think about recommendation and discovery. That same ease of discovery also changed the game for creators – on TikTok, anyone has a chance to reach an audience, without needing to be a celebrity or social influencer with a large following.TikTok's popularity grew much faster than any of us could have imagined. Today people come to this platform for entertainment, learning, and increasingly, as a place where small businesses can reach consumers and build a following. During the pandemic, like many platforms, we saw that growth increase significantly as families sought creative ways to connect with one another.With our success has come added scrutiny. We appreciate this, as the tech industry has rightfully been asked tough questions in recent years. While we strongly disagree with the implications of TikTok as a national security threat, we nonetheless understand the concerns. Over the last year we've taken numerous steps to increase transparency, including hiring a world-class Chief Security Officer with decades of US law enforcement and industry experience; launching a Transparency and Accountability Center where experts can inspect our algorithm, code, and moderation practices; hiring hundreds of engineers in the US; and publishing our first Transparency Reports.We're pleased that today we've confirmed a proposal that resolves the Administration's security concerns and settles questions around TikTok's future in the US. Our plan is extensive and consistent with previous CFIUS resolutions, including working with Oracle, who will be our trusted cloud and technology provider responsible for fully securing our users' data. We are committed to protecting our users globally and providing the highest levels of security. Both Oracle and Walmart will take part in a TikTok Global pre-IPO financing round in which they can take up to a 20% cumulative stake in the company. We will also maintain and expand the US as TikTok Global's headquarters while bringing 25,000 jobs across the country.TikTok has won the hearts of hundreds of millions of people around the world, including 100 million Americans, because it's a home for entertainment, connection, and expression. We're delighted that the individuals who've turned their creativity on TikTok into thriving careers, the small businesses using TikTok to connect with customers during the pandemic, and the families who've found joy and connection through our platform will be able to use TikTok for many years to come. We want to thank all of the members of our community who have shown tremendous support – to us, but more importantly, for each other – throughout this period of turbulence. TikTok is what it is because of all of you.Our team works tirelessly to provide a safe and inclusive platform, and we're thrilled that we will be able to continue serving our amazingly diverse and creative community. This is just the beginning for TikTok, and we're so excited to be with you in this journey for the long run."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/latinx-heritage-month","date":"2020-09-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"La TikTok #FamiliaLatina","text":"By ​Isabel Quinteros​, TikTok Music & ​Sophie Sanders​, TikTok Creator Community The TikTok community is made up of people of all backgrounds, experiences, interests and passions.

This Latinx Heritage Month, we are celebrating our #FamiliaLatina to honor the cultures and contributions of the TikTok Latinx community. Our #FamiliaLatina is made up of users, creators, and artists who trace their roots back to Latin American countries from around the world, including household names such as @jlo and @arod13, world-renowned @chefjoseandres, and digital entertainers like @lgndfrvr and @boomfamf. #Latina, #Latino, and #Hispanic combined have more than 31 billion views.

The histories, cultures, and contributions of Hispanic and Latino Americans of past and present are not lost on our community and we are excited to honor and celebrate them.TikTok TrailblazersTo kick off the month, we are unveiling our first Latinx TikTok Trailblazers. These creators have been nominated by the community as the next-generation of Latinx digital entertainment leaders. Their creativity, passion, and authentic spirit has gained them loyal followers and hundreds of thousands of 'likes.' Our inaugural Latinx Trailblazers are:@adamrayokay - Adam and his alter-ego, Rosa - a lovable, relatable, and charismatic persona - is a TikTok phenomenon who entertains and inspires the community.@devonrodriguezart - Devon spreads his creative vision and connects with the Latinx community through drawing, including popular portraits of subway riders from his community in New York. @itsnikki.g - As a queer, body-positive creator,Nikki wants to be the representation she didn't see growing up and spread positivity and acceptance across TikTok. @jennymartinezzz - Jenny gives her followers a taste of Mexican culture through food, sharing authentic recipes she learned from her mother with the community. @latinajesus - Jesus inspires people to laugh and enjoy life through his content. @lgndfrvr - Justice shares his authentic and raw journey as a Latino dad and embodies the spirit of family. @monicamamudo - Monica - also known as \"your Brazilian Big Sister\" - uses TikTok to talk about Brazilian culture, break down stereotypes and, of course, explain memes.@omayazein - Omaya showcases intersectionality and pride in being an Arab-Latina. @salicerose - As an original TikTok creator, Salice sparks joy and keeps followers smiling through her comedic videos.@siennamae - Sienna focuses on body-positive TikTok videos and promotion of self-love.@spencerx - Beatboxer, SpencerX, uses TikTok to share beatboxing culture in a fun and entertaining way. @zachv_pat - Lovable brothers, Zachary and Patrick strive to educate and entertain with their positive, comedic, and wholesome skits and dance videos.The Trailblazers are just the start of our Latinx Heritage Month celebrations.

We'll be dialing up the Latinx heat on TikTok LIVE. Check the Discover page daily for updates on Latinx Heritage Month LIVE programming. To further support Latinx music artists, we have curated a special Sounds page featuring artists that represent a diverse spectrum of Latinx demographics and music genres. We also created TikTok Latinx Heritage Month playlists on our official Spotify and Apple Music TikTok accounts, featuring songs from popular and emerging Latinx artists from the platform. And, of course, no TikTok experience is complete without special effects, which is why we've added fun #FamiliaLatina stickers to the Create page.We know there are more ways to support and celebrate the community beyond programming and entertainment, which is why we also partnered with the Hispanic Heritage Foundation (HHF), a non-profit established by the White House in 1987. We have added HHF to the TikTok Donation Stickers program and TikTok is providing a $750,000 grant to support HHF's COVID-19 community relief efforts. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) recently published that COVID-19 positivity rate among Latinx populations was about three times higher than for any other racial and ethnic group. Black and Hispanic individuals have a disproportionately high number of COVID-19 infections, given that they are more likely to be essential workers and less likely to have had the choice of working from home. We want to make sure we are doing our part to support our communities where we can, putting action behind our words, and providing a way for users to support as well. Celebrating and uplifting the diverse voices of the TikTok community is of utmost importance to us.

From people who lip-sync dialogue from television and film, to POV-style content where users develop their own dramatic scenarios, acting has always been on TikTok. Those formats have coalesced into a single popular trend that has gained notoriety on platform. In this version, users create \"Acting Challenges\" in which they encourage others to duet them and read specifically-colored dialogue from the original video. \"Acting Challenge! Duet me. You are the blue line.\" Once the duet is complete, it creates a scene between the two users.Initially, these were intended in a somewhat serious manner, but because the TikTok community is the TikTok community, the videos quickly shifted to embrace a more light-hearted and comedic perspective.

The Creator Fund is in its early stages, and we're continuously exploring new ways to improve the experience for our creator community and the way creators are rewarded. We’re looking forward to sharing more information soon!Last month we launched our $1B TikTok Creator Fund to support and reward creators for the time and dedication they put into creating entertaining, inspiring, and uplifting content for the TikTok community. So far, tens of thousands of US creators have applied and joined the Creator Fund, including finance guru @humphreytalks, creative mixologist @theparadise.bartender, and woodworking expert @johnsoncowoodworking. Over the last few weeks, we've seen more diverse and engaging content than ever before, from learning about the difference between a Honey Badger and a Tasmanian Devil to how to cut a jackfruit to what school teachers find comical. As we continue to make progress with the program, we're excited to announce that the Creator Fund wallet will soon be available. In just a couple of weeks, creators will be able to transfer funds from the Creator Fund to their linked payment method, and at the end of each month, creators will be able to withdraw their earned funds and enjoy the fruit of their creativity and passion.From well-known creators to stars on the rise, we're thrilled to be able to support and reward those who contribute to the ever-evolving and growing TikTok community. Since this is a new program, we also know that there are questions and even theories about how the Creator Fund operates, and we want to address two of those that we hear most frequently. First, being in the Creator Fund has no direct impact on the TikTok recommendation system. On TikTok, For You feed recommendations reflect preferences unique to each user and the recommendation system doesn't know whether or not a creator is part of the Creator Fund. Therefore, being part of the Creator Fund doesn't affect how your videos will perform – it just means you will now be rewarded for them.We reviewed a sample set of users whose follower counts range from 10K to 10M and who have consistently uploaded videos, seven days before and seven days after they joined the Creator Fund. We found that video viewership continued to fluctuate, though a majority of users' video views increased after joining the program. We then looked at the data more broadly - at the performance of creators in the fund, and those outside of the fund - and found viewership performance was the same.Community-favorite creator, author, and entrepreneur, @hankgreen1, tested things out by exiting the Fund for a period of time to observe whether or not his video views improved, then re-joined and shared his learnings with us:\"I was just proving to some creator friends of mine that turning off creator fund wasn't going to fix my drop in views. Not sure if you've seen the theories, but when a platform makes a big change like this, it's easy to anchor any change in views on the new thing rather than other possible explanations. It was also nice to go through the process of turning it off and on just to see how it worked. Super smooth!\" - @hankgreen1 Second, funds are calculated based upon a number of factors. These factors include video views, video engagement, authenticity of a view, region in which your video is viewed, total participants in the program, as well as adherence to the Community Guidelines and Terms of Service. What is uniquely TikTok about the Creator Fund is that a video has the opportunity to reach global audiences. Like video views, funds are therefore dynamic.The Creator Fund is in its early stages and we appreciate your patience and ideas as we continue to improve the experience for those in the program, better explain how it works, and evolve things to meet the expectations and needs of our community.

That’s where TikTok comes in.TikTok is the place for creativity and joy, and a big part of that is fashion. In celebration of our community and all-things style on the platform, we’ve partnered with a range of amazing fashion companies and creators to launch something fabulous: #TikTokFashionMonth. From now to October 8th, the TikTok community, fashion brands, creators and celebrities will come to TikTok to strut their stuff through a series of hashtags, LIVE streams and new creative effects. \"We've seen the fashion industry reinvent what luxury fashion means to culture and society through TikTok by bringing fashion into the homes of our community during quarantine. With the launch of our TikTok Fashion Month, this is just another way for our brand partners to leverage the platform's authentic and community-driven approach to showcase their art, creativity and personalities in a unique and truly TikTok way,” says CeCe Vu, Fashion Content Partnerships Lead at TikTok. “We're so thrilled to be able to offer an inclusive and immersive virtual fashion month experience for our community and are excited to see how they engage with each piece of live programming, hashtag challenge and creative effect.\"LIVE from the Runway, With Love from TikTokNow through October 8th, we will host two LIVE streams per week, featuring runway shows by luxury designers including Saint Laurent, JW Anderson, and Louis Vuitton.Check out the schedule here: 9/2 - Louis Vuitton Men’s Runway 9/6 - ‘Fashion Essentials’ with Wisdom Kaye9/9 - Saint Laurent Runway 9/18 - ‘Get The Look’ with Ariam 9/24 - Prada Runway 9/28 - JW Anderson Collection Reveal 10/8 - TikTok Runway Odyssey with PUMA and Alice + Olivia“It's always been important for JW Anderson to work with new technologies and platforms.

That's why we opened our global Transparency and Accountability Centers for experts and lawmakers to see first-hand how we're working to build a safe and secure platform for our growing and diverse community. Due to physical constraints around the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, opening the center has meant evolving our original plans to offer a virtual experience until we can welcome guests to the full tour at our physical locations in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. To date nearly two dozen experts and Congressional offices have visited virtually, allowing them to learn and ask questions about our safety and security practices. Content moderationIn our virtual experience we provide extensive detail on how our moderators review content and accounts that are escalated via user reports and technology-based flagging. This includes walking visitors through our safety classifiers and deep learning models that work to proactively identify harmful content and our decision engine that ranks potentially violating content to help moderation teams review the most urgent content first. We also demonstrate our object detection models that flag things like hate symbols to our human moderators for further review. At our physical centers, guests will be able to sit in the seat of a content moderator, use our moderation platform, review and label sample content, and experiment with various detection models. RecommendationsDuring the virtual experience, we also share details about how our recommendation system operates and how we consider user experience and safety in building recommendations. This includes sharing how our systems work to diversify content in the For You feed and additional insights into how content is tailored to the preferences of each user. Finally, we review some of our efforts to address the common challenges of recommendation engines.Privacy & Security Under the leadership of our Chief Security Officer, Roland Cloutier – who has decades of experience in law enforcement and the financial services industry – our teams work to protect our community's information and stay ahead of evolving security challenges. Our virtual experience shows visitors how we store TikTok user data in the US and safeguard that data from hackers and other threats with encryption and the latest technology. We also detail how we work with industry-leading third party experts – the same ones used by the federal government – to test and validate our security processes. In our physical centers, we'll also give experts a first-hand look at how we keep our platform safe 24 hours a day, seven days a week through a cutting-edge fusion center. Our virtual Transparency and Accountability Center builds on work we're already doing to increase visibility into how our platform operates, including publishing Transparency Reports, launching a Transparency hub, sharing more about how we recommend content, and more.We believe all companies should disclose their algorithms, moderation policies, and data flows to regulators, and we hear from lawmakers that that's what they want, too. We're proud to be the first to take this important step toward an unprecedented level of accountability and transparency. If you’re a lawmaker or policy, content safety, or security expert looking for more information about our virtual tours, please email transparency [at] tiktok [dot] com."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/skin-school-with-hailey-bieber","date":"2020-09-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"#SkinSchool with Dr. Barbara Sturm and Hailey Bieber","text":"Our important, continued commitment to wear masks and face coverings to keep everybody around us safe has been challenging on our skin. ‘Maskne’ - portmanteau that is now everyday vernacular to describe face acne and irritation from wearing a mask - is real and we are teaming up with Dr. Barbara Sturm, creator of the now famous ‘vampire facial’, and founder and CEO of her namesake, celeb-loved skincare brand, to bring her educational series, Skin School, to TikTok with special guest and TikTok Queen Hailey Bieber. As an extension of #LearnOnTikTok, the duo will help teens and young adults (and late skincare bloomers, too!) get a safe start on their skin journey.

Like Duet, Stitch is a way to reinterpret and add to another user's content, building on their stories, tutorials, recipes, math lessons, and more.Users can decide in their settings whether or not others can Stitch their content, just like with Duet. The option can be accessed on the Privacy and Safety page under 'Settings and Privacy,' where users can enable or disable Stitch for all videos.

Every video made with Stitch attributes the original creator in the new video's caption, and the caption attribution links directly to the original, clipped video. We have lots of ideas about how users will make use of Stitch, but we're confident we'll be delighted and surprised by our community's ingenuity in creating with it and bringing new stories to life.

You can speed videos up, slow them down, add transitions, and apply all kinds of creative effects, voiceovers, and filters to your posts. In just the same way, you can bring your photos to life on TikTok, too, with a variety of special effects and features made just for still images. Make your photos stand out with some of these tips, tricks, and delightful photo features on TikTok. Green Screen StickersYou already know and love TikTok's Green Screen video effects - from the original Green Screen effect (which supports photos and videos) to Green Screen Sky and Green Screen Thought Bubbles. But for the times you want to share photos mid-video, we recommend trying the Green Screen Sticker, which allows you to drop a photo sticker into any TikTok video. To access Green Screen Stickers, press the Effects button at the bottom-left corner of the Record Video page. From there, find the effect icon that looks like a person gazing up at the Green Screen logoOnce you click the effect, you'll be able to select an image from your device and load it into your video as a Green Screen Sticker. This effect is a great way to reference photos in your video by pasting them directly into different clips, whether you're providing commentary on the photos you embed or, in some cases, delivering flawless character impersonations that require photo references. Make a slideshow with your photosThere are some stories that can only be told in photos. If you find yourself wanting to share a photo album in video form, you might consider building a photo slideshow. You can make a slideshow by going to the Record Video page, pressing the \"Upload\" button at the bottom-right corner of the screen, toggling from \"Videos\" to \"Image,\" and selecting the photos you'd like to include in a slideshow. Once you've selected your photos and hit \"Next,\" your images will be played in slideshow format in the same order that they were selected. From there, you can choose to add filters, voiceover, sounds, text, and more to your slideshow. Make it creative! Make a video with just a single photo That's right, even a single photo can now be transformed into a video on TikTok! Just like with slideshows, click the \"Upload\" button on the Record Video page and select a single photo you'd like to have turned into a video on TikTok. Then, press the \"Next\" button, and you'll be all set. That's all you have to do! TikTok handles the rest by automatically adding sound and effects to your image, giving it dimension and making it pop.

Bardcore, of course, refers to the performance of modern popular songs in Medieval styles. Think \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" played with a harp, or someone covering \"WAP\" with a lute. These songs have become somewhat popular because of their uniqueness and recently drove an entire content format on TikTok.Beginning with a Medieval cover of Shakira's \"Hips Don't Lie\", users followed an anachronistic format where they would find a bardcore song, use Green Screen to upload a painting from the Middle Ages, and then show themselves dancing in front of the art with TikTok Text that described a light hearted, \"ancient\" behavior. Whether it was saying \"good day instead of good morning,\" using the word \"parched instead of thirsty,\" or just imagining Medieval-inspired fandom, the content was extremely diverse and high-quality.Over time, the content expanded to include a variety of Bardcore-inspired covers, including \"Barbie Girl\" and \"Watermelon Sugar.\" Notable Video New Effect: Laser BackgroundWith a nostalgic image, the Laser Background effect set the perfect backdrop for the popular #Queerbook trend. Hot Track: Classical MusicTikTok showed off it's classy side by making \"Classical Music\" one of the hottest sounds on the app...behind \"WAP.\" Whether your telling a story, showing off a skill, or feeding your crocs, this sound elevates any video.

As a major launching pad for new artists and popular hits, TikTok is proud to play a role in propelling songs up the charts.In March, the TikTok community fell in love with the “#BlindingLightsChallenge,” a family-friendly group dance set to The Weeknd’s shimmering anthem “Blinding Lights.” The After Hours song inspired over 4 million video creations, and videos tagged with the “#BlindingLightsChallenge” hashtag racked up over 437 million views. Last night, The Weeknd took home the Moon Man for “Video Of The Year,” reaffirming the artist’s unique and special visual aesthetic which he took to a new level on the “The Weeknd Experience,” a highly-successful TikTok LIVE stream. TikTok’s community has the unique ability to launch artists into new career heights, so it’s no surprise that Doja Cat, the VMA winner for “Best New Artist,” had a massive year on TikTok. Originally released in 2019, Doja Cat’s “Say So” reached a new commercial peak when it caught fire on TikTok in the Spring, inspiring over 19 million video creations and a viral dance craze, created by user @yodelinghaley that Doja included in the song’s official music video. When Nicki Minaj hopped on the remix, “Say So” reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Doja Cat is one of the most popular artists on TikTok, with viral hits like “Like That” ft. Gucci Mane, “Boss B*tch,” and more. H-Town hot girl Megan The Stallion won the VMA for “Best Hip Hop Video” for “Savage,” beating out fellow TikTok sensation Roddy Ricch. Spurred by a dance craze created by teenaged choreographer @keke.janajah, “Savage” is one of the most popular songs in TikTok history, inspiring over 30 million video creations and billions of views. “Savage” experienced a meteoric rise up the Billboard charts after it was the most-viewed TikTok sound of March 2020 (7.5 billion views), and jumped to Billboard’s #1 in May, when Megan’s fellow Houstonian Beyoncé hopped on the remix with a TikTok-referencing verse (“Hips Tik Tok when I dance”). One of the night’s big winners was BTS, the legendary K-Pop group whose fervent fans flock to TikTok by the tens of millions to view their videos and create their own using BTS sounds. The group is one of the most-followed music accounts on the platform (18 million+ followers), and they made waves by premiering their single “ON” exclusively on TikTok in February. The “#btson” challenge earned more than 108 million views on its videos. Ever a cultural force, the group has another viral hit on its hands with “Dynamite,” their first-ever song recorded wholly in English, which has already generated over 450K video creations in under two weeks.

Jay La Rosa, Global Security, TikTokAt TikTok, our security team is constantly working to make people safer in an environment of ever-evolving threats. Over the past few years, consumers have become much more aware of potential risks. A smarter, more well-informed community is better for everyone, including those of us in the security field. It pushes us to constantly improve our systems and efforts, and question all of our underlying assumptions. This is part of why we've continued to rapidly develop our team – including adding hundreds of engineers in the US over the last year.We also know it's not enough to keep users safe from real threats – we also need to further reduce the potential confusion that can arise from things that can be perceived or misinterpreted as threats. As engineers, we're innately attuned to actual and potential threats, but providing users with true peace of mind can only come when we stretch ourselves beyond the actual and potential realm, and appreciate perception.Earlier this year, for example, we saw speculation about clipboard access that we believe posed no actual risk, but appreciated that there was concern. We immediately took steps to reduce clipboard access – even though information was never leaving a user's device and was consistent with the behavior of what other apps, including most news media apps, were doing.We believe it is more important to provide peace of mind to our community than to provide marginal functionality of a feature, or give convenience to a user or engineer. In line with this, we continue to work on similar efforts around cleaning up inactive code in the app to reduce potential confusion or misconceptions. For example, we are enhancing the ecosystem around our self-developed code for automated attack defense that detects and prevents inauthentic and bot-like behavior and integrating new and advanced industry leading partners to prevent abuse.These efforts go beyond what many of our peers do and require extensive time and resources, but we view this as one of the most important moves we can make to build trust with our community. We appreciate when security experts ask critical questions about how technology companies are keeping our community safe because this moves trust and safety forward for all users, which is the most important thing companies can achieve.After all, TikTok's goal is to inspire creativity and bring joy. And we can achieve that most effectively when users have complete peace of mind."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-files-lawsuit","date":"2020-08-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Why we are suing the Administration","text":"Today we are filing a complaint in federal court challenging the Administration's efforts to ban TikTok in the US. As a company we have always focused on transparency, so we want to explain why we are taking this step.Over the past few years, people of all backgrounds have embraced the TikTok community. Today, 100 million Americans turn to TikTok for entertainment, inspiration, and connection; countless creators rely on our platform to express their creativity, reach broad audiences, and generate income; our more than 1,500 employees across the US pour their hearts into building this platform every day, with 10,000 more jobs planned in California, Texas, New York, Tennessee, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, and Washington State; and many of the country's leading brands are on TikTok to connect with consumers more authentically and directly than they can elsewhere. Put simply, we have a thriving community and we are grateful – and responsible – to them.The Executive Order issued by the Administration on August 6, 2020 has the potential to strip the rights of that community without any evidence to justify such an extreme action, and without any due process. We strongly disagree with the Administration's position that TikTok is a national security threat and we have articulated these objections previously.Now is the time for us to act. We do not take suing the government lightly, however we feel we have no choice but to take action to protect our rights, and the rights of our community and employees. In our complaint we make clear that we believe the Administration ignored our extensive efforts to address its concerns, which we conducted fully and in good faith even as we disagreed with the concerns themselves:\"The executive order seeks to ban TikTok purportedly because of the speculative possibility that the application could be manipulated by the Chinese government. But, as the U.S. government is well aware, Plaintiffs have taken extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok’s U.S. user data, including by having TikTok store such data outside of China (in the United States and Singapore) and by erecting software barriers that help ensure that TikTok stores its U.S. user data separately from the user data of other ByteDance products. These actions were made known to the U.S. government during a recent U.S. national security review of ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition of a China-based company, Musical.ly. As part of that review, Plaintiffs provided voluminous documentation to the U.S. government documenting TikTok's security practices and made commitments that were more than sufficient to address any conceivable U.S. government privacy or national security concerns...\"The Administration ignored the great lengths that TikTok has gone to in order to demonstrate our commitment to serving the US market:\"The key personnel responsible for TikTok, including its CEO, Global Chief Security Officer, and General Counsel, are all Americans based in the United States—and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore.\"Further, as we note in our complaint, not only does the Executive Order ignore due process, it also authorizes the prohibition of activities that have not been found to be \"an unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as required by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), under which the Administration is purportedly acting:\"By banning TikTok with no notice or opportunity to be heard (whether before or after the fact), the executive order violates the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment.\"The order is ultra vires because it is not based on a bona fide national emergency and authorizes the prohibition of activities that have not been found to pose 'an unusual and extraordinary threat.'\"In the complaint we also point to the fact that the August 6 Executive Order is a misuse of IEEPA:\"...the actions directed in the August 6 executive order are not supported by the emergency declared a year earlier in Executive Order 13873. \"That previous executive order was designed to address asserted U.S. national security concerns about certain telecommunications companies’ ability to abuse access to 'information and communications technology and services' that 'store and communicate vast amounts of sensitive information, facilitate the digital economy, and support critical infrastructure and vital emergency services, in order to commit malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage against the United States and its people.'\"TikTok Inc. is not a telecommunications provider and it does not provide the types of technology and services contemplated by the 2019 executive order. Specifically, TikTok Inc. does not provide the hardware backbone to 'facilitate the digital economy,' and TikTok Inc. has no role in providing 'critical infrastructure and vital emergency services.'\"In the complaint we also go into significant detail about the nearly year-long effort we made in good faith to provide the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) the voluminous information requested – was disregarded – and the numerous steps we offered to take in our commitment to transparency and cooperation:\"In 2019, CFIUS contacted ByteDance to consider whether to review its acquisition of Musical.ly, a China-based video-sharing platform—even though Musical.ly was based in China and had very limited assets in the United States. This review was highly unusual in that ByteDance had acquired Musical.ly two years earlier in 2017, Musical.ly was previously Chinese-owned and based in China, and ByteDance had predominantly abandoned Musical.ly’s limited U.S. assets by the time of CFIUS’s outreach in 2019.\"During this period, and through the course of the CFIUS review, ByteDance provided voluminous documentation and information in response to CFIUS’s questions. Among other evidence, ByteDance submitted detailed documentation to CFIUS demonstrating TikTok’s security measures to help ensure U.S. user data is safeguarded in storage and in transit and cannot be accessed by unauthorized persons—including any government—outside the United States. \"CFIUS never articulated any reason why TikTok’s security measures were inadequate to address any national security concerns, and effectively terminated formal communications with Plaintiffs well before the conclusion of the initial statutory review period. Notwithstanding the U.S. government's failure to identify any security risk, in an effort to address any conceivable concerns that the U.S. government may have and to assure continuity for the U.S. users who had come to value and cherish the platform that TikTok provides, Plaintiffs took the extraordinary step of offering to restructure their U.S. business...\"Despite these repeated efforts and concrete proposals to alleviate any national security concerns, the agency record reflects that CFIUS repeatedly refused to engage with ByteDance and its counsel about CFIUS’s concerns.\"Finally, despite all of these efforts, without the standard communication appropriate in a CFIUS case, and with little regard to the mitigation proposals that TikTok had made, CFIUS rushed out its decision within five minutes of its deadline:\"At 11:55 p.m. on July 30, 2020—the final day of the statutory CFIUS review period—the Committee issued a letter stating that 'CFIUS has identified national security risks arising from the Transaction and that it has not identified mitigation measures that would address those risks.'\"The CFIUS letter was principally based on outdated news articles, failed to address the voluminous documentation that Plaintiffs had provided demonstrating the security of TikTok user data, and was flawed in numerous other respects.\"Likewise, in the August 6 Executive Order issued under IEEPA, the Administration failed to follow due process and act in good faith, neither providing evidence that TikTok was an actual threat, nor justification for its punitive actions. We believe the Administration's decisions were heavily politicized, and industry experts have said the same. As the complaint explains:\"The executive order is not rooted in bona fide national security concerns. Independent national security and information security experts have criticized the political nature of this executive order, and expressed doubt as to whether its stated national security objective is genuine...\"The President’s demands for payments have no relationship to any conceivable national security concern and serve only to underscore that Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs with the due process required by law.\"To be clear, we far prefer constructive dialogue over litigation. But with the Executive Order threatening to bring a ban on our US operations – eliminating the creation of 10,000 American jobs and irreparably harming the millions of Americans who turn to this app for entertainment, connection, and legitimate livelihoods that are vital especially during the pandemic – we simply have no choice.We will continue the work we have long been undertaking to earn the trust of our full US community. For example, our Transparency and Accountability Center is central among those ongoing efforts as an industry-leading step to build trust and understanding of our moderation policies, source code, and data practices. Our legal challenge is a protection to ensure that these efforts can take place without the threat of an unwarranted ban hovering like a dark cloud over the joy and creativity of our community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/countering-hate-on-tiktok","date":"2020-08-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"Countering hate on TikTok","text":"By Eric Han, Head of Safety, TikTok USTikTok is a diverse and growing community. Our users include grandparents who show us their dance moves; farmers who show us their fields; nurses who share what life's like on the front lines of the pandemic; and activists who bring us along to marches and protests. Part of the magic of TikTok is how people from all walks of life use the platform to connect through creative, authentic expression. As the Head of Safety, my team and I work to protect our users from the things that could interfere with their ability to express themselves safely and have a positive experience on the app. In what can feel like an increasingly divisive world, one of the areas we're especially intent on improving is our policies and actions towards hateful content and behavior. Our goal is to eliminate hate on TikTok. Today we want to share five ways we're working diligently to counter the spread of hate on our platform. 1) Evolving our hate speech policy. We continue to take a proactive approach to stopping the spread of hate and known hate and violent extremist groups. It starts with our Community Guidelines – the code of conduct for our growing global community – which prohibit any form of hateful speech or ideology, as well as harassment and bullying. We define hate speech as \"content that intends to or does attack, threaten, incite violence against, or dehumanize an individual or group of individuals on the basis of protected attributes like race, religion, gender, gender identity, national origin, and more.\"  We work to proactively detect and remove such content before it reaches our community, and we carefully review content our community reports to us. We regularly consult with experts to help our policies evolve as hateful behavior itself does. For example, this year we expanded these policies to better account for scenarios that make others feel excluded or marginalized. It's our job to remain vigilant for the sake and safety of our community. 2) Countering hateful speech, behavior, and groups. We do not tolerate hate on TikTok. We remove hateful content – including race-based harassment – from our platform as we become aware of it. We also ban accounts that repeatedly promote it. We have a zero tolerance stance on organized hate groups and those associated with them, like accounts that spread or are linked to white supremacy or nationalism, male supremacy, anti-semitism, and other hate-based ideologies. In addition, we remove race-based harassment and the denial of violent tragedies, such as the Holocaust and slavery. We may also take off-platform behavior into consideration as we enforce our policies, such as an account belonging to the leader of a known hate group, to protect people against harm. Since the start of 2020, we've removed more than 380,000 videos in the US for violating our hate speech policy. We also banned more than 1,300 accounts for hateful content or behavior, and removed over 64,000 hateful comments. To be clear, these numbers don't reflect a 100% success rate in catching every piece of hateful content or behavior, but they do indicate our commitment to action.Another strategy is making it more difficult for people to find hateful content and accounts, which creates room for more positive and joyful content. For instance, if someone searches for a hateful ideology or group, such as \"heil Hitler\" or \"groyper,” we take various approaches to stop the spread of hate, including removing related content, refraining from showing results, or redirecting the search to our Community Guidelines to educate our community about our policies against hateful expression. It's not a fail-safe solution, but we work to quickly apply this approach to hate groups as they emerge. 3) Increasing cultural awareness in our content moderation. As a Safety team, it's on us to recognize the many forms hate takes so that we can develop policies and enforcement strategies to combat it effectively. We periodically train our enforcement teams to better detect evolving hateful behavior, symbols, terms, and offensive stereotypes. For example, we acknowledge that different communities have different lived experiences, and language previously used to exclude and demean groups of people is now being reclaimed by these communities and used as terms of empowerment and counterspeech. We're working to incorporate the evolution of expression into our policies and are training our moderation teams to better understand more nuanced content like cultural appropriation and slurs. If a member of a disenfranchised group, such as the LGBTQ+, Latinx, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Black, and Indigenous communities, uses a slur as a term of empowerment, we want our moderators to understand the context behind it and not mistakenly take the content down. On the other hand, if a slur is being used hatefully, it doesn't belong on TikTok. Educating our content moderation teams on these important distinctions is ongoing work, and we strive to get this right for our users. 4) Improving transparency with our community. We want our community to know that we're listening to their feedback, and we're working to increase transparency into the reasons content may be removed. For example, we recently released a feature that notifies users if they duet or react to a video that was removed for violating our Community Guidelines. This feature was built in response to feedback from users who made duets condemning other content; without clarity, they often felt betrayed to find their own video removed, which would happen because the original video they duetted with was taken down. We’re also working to improve our appeals process and proactively educate about our Community Guidelines. As an example, if a user searches for #whitelivesmatter, they'll be reminded of our guidelines and our commitment to fostering a respectful and diverse community.5) Investing in our teams and partnerships. We continue to invest in our ability to detect and triage hateful or abusive behavior to our enforcement teams as quickly as possible. We recently added leaders with deep expertise in these areas to our product and engineering teams to focus on enforcement-related efficiencies and transparency. We also actively work to learn and get feedback from experts, like those on our Content Advisory Council and civil society organizations. Our industry hasn't always gotten these decisions right, but we are committed to learning from the mistakes of others' – and our own. We expect to be held accountable for any shortcomings and progress; by working together, we will continue to improve our policies, processes, and products that keep TikTok a place where everyone feels welcome.We recognize the perhaps insurmountable challenge to completely eliminate hate on TikTok – but that won't stop us from trying. Every bit of progress we make gets us that much closer to a more welcoming community experience for people on TikTok and out in the world. These issues are complex and constantly changing – not just for us, but for all internet companies. We are committed to getting it right for our community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-mi-pan-su-su-sum","date":"2020-08-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: Mi pan su su sum","text":"TikTok users remixed Russian cereal commercial to created the #MiPan top trend. Take a deeper look at content form this trend in addition to top videos, creators, songs, and effects. Current Top Trend: #MiPanThe TikTok community has embraced a remixed Russian cereal commercial song from 2010, because why not. Built around a jingle for the Russian cereal, \"Miel Pops,\" the #MiPan trend started when Russian user @chernaya.princessa, who uploaded an a cappella cover of the song on May 27th. The track moved through TikTok videos, before eventually being remixed by @isterrrrika, who raised the pitch and sped up the track while setting it on top of gameplay footage from video game, Roblox. The audio was discovered by @awa_de_horchata_uwu, who used the sound as the backdrop for an animated dancing llama, helping the song take off on \"Alt TikTok,\" the side of TikTok known for less mainstream tastes. Videos using the sound feature similar dances with bread and quirky \"Alt TikTok\" content. This trend shows how sounds can spread across countries and languages on TikTok and that anything can turn into a viral sensation on the app. Songs may spring to #1 like Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's \"WAP,\" and they can rise through a slower burn. If you aren't sure what to think of this unique trend, then you're clearly too mainstream for \"Alt TikTok.\" Notable Video New Effect: Green Screen TileThe new \"Green Screen Tile\" is latest in TikTok's line of popular green screen effect. This edition lets users replace their background with a tiled version of their camera, adding to the diversity and impact of videos. Hot Track: BulletproofLa Roux's \"Bulletproof\" has become a top song on TikTok with the help of a trend where users explained what made them emotionally bulletproof. The trend opens with a caption that reads \"You think you can hurt my feelings?\" before the user lists something they were made fun of for now or when they were younger. Whether that be a family connection, physical feature, or something more personal, these users have banned together to show how they can withstand hurtful words. Creator Spotlight: My NguyenMy Nguyen, otherwise known as @myhealthydish, might not always make healthy dishes but they're always delicious, at least in most users' eyes. This culinary creator was voluntarily roasted by Gordon Ramsay for her low carb bell pepper sandwich. Despite Ramsay's harsh words, the duet helped Nguyen gain exposure and grow her dedicated following of up-in-coming home chefs who love delicious, healthy cooking.

Videos travel far and wide as they're discovered, shared, and reimagined in Duets. As an idea catches on, so too does its impact across borders, cultures, languages, and communities. What begins as seconds of authentic creativity often turns into much more: careers blossom, memes develop, hobbies flourish, communities coalesce, and obscure songs climb to the top of music charts. Once a story For You, it becomes a story for her, for him, for them, for us. We continue to be inspired by all that starts on TikTok, from the creators to the commenters, LIVE streamers, viewers, and fans who propel unique and inspiring content into memorable cultural moments and movements. We're only halfway through the year, but the impact of the TikTok community on every facet of culture – arts, food, beauty, fashion, film – is undeniable. Today, we're celebrating you, our TikTok community, for making TikTok a ubiquitous part of everyday American life.Careers are born Creators have launched impressive careers by sharing their stories, songs, and talents on TikTok. Dixie D'Amelio, a community favorite, parlayed her talents on TikTok to a music and acting career. In early quarantine days, Curtis Roach's \"Bored in the House\" gathered millions of views as people around the world made all kinds of content to his original sound, helping land Curtis a collaboration with Tyga and a promising music career. Sarah Cooper, known for her sketch videos, recently landed a comedy special on Netflix. And to think it was only a year and a half ago that Lil Nas X first shared Old Town Road with the TikTok world, bringing cowboy hats to dance floors around the world.Hobbies find a homeWhether #SkateTok is your TikTok vibe or you call #CottageCore your home, people of all backgrounds and interests find connections and develop bonds on TikTok through shared passions. From TikTok's home improvement universe to #PlantsOfTikTok, people have been inspired to try new crafts, take on DIY projects, and pursue newfound passions because of the daily doses of inspiration within our community's sharing, making, and crafting. Families come togetherFrom the McFarland family's #BlindingLights dance skills, to Jalaiah Harmon and her mom encouraging handwashing, to Jennifer Lopez and her kids trying something new, we love seeing families cook, dance, party, and perform together for audiences who are inspired to do the same at home. Moms perform sing-alongs with their daughters, pet owners and their fur babies try dance challenges, and father-son teams jump on the 'Love Story' viral challenge. One trend inspires another, bringing families closer for movie nights and making grandparents the superstars they deserve to be.Learning is reimaginedThere's so much learning that starts on TikTok. Our community is teaching everything from basic algebra to fast facts about pufferfish and entropy. Beloved American science educator, Bill Nye, continues to show us that that science is fun and entertaining. We've practiced recipes for healthy meals, studied new languages, and learned how to dress up loungewear in quarantine. Teachers are finding new ways to connect and reach students where they are, and discovering their own talents, passions and dancing shoes along the way. Causes find supporters Our community has also helped launch awareness campaigns around causes that matter, giving back to those who need it most. TikTok creator Lexy Kadey uses her videos to raise funds for enormous tips that she then pays forward to restaurant waiters, deliverymen, performers, and more. Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk put on a first-ever 12-hour TikTok LIVE stream that brought over $2 million in donations (through a TikTok Donation Sticker), as part of the ALL IN Challenge. The Weeknd rallied more than two million users for a virtual concert benefitting the Equal Justice Initiative. Across the country and around the world, creators stood in solidarity with the Black community, igniting important conversations about systemic racial injustice and amassing nearly 20 billion uses of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter.

From likes and favorites to comments and shares, your video has the potential to touch the lives of many people, and bring joy to the TikTok community and beyond. You may wonder what type of impact the time, passion, and dedication you put into each video might have, which is why we've built in TikTok Analytics - so you can observe the performance of your videos and measure their reach and impact. To access Analytics, you'll first have to switch to a Pro Account. Just head to the \"Settings and Privacy\" page, choose \"Manage My Account,\" and tap \"Switch to Pro Account.\" Once you've switched, you'll find your analytics in the \"Pro Account\" page of your settings. On desktop, you can access the Analytics page by hovering over your profile photo in the upper-right corner of your screen and clicking \"View Analytics.\" You can also download and export your Analytics directly to your computer when you access TikTok from your desktop device. You'll find three sections on the Analytics page: Overview, Content, and Followers. OverviewThe Overview section gives you a high-level summary of your account's performance over time. You'll see the total number of times your videos were viewed, the number of users who follow your account, and the number of times your profile was viewed. ContentIn the Content section, you can see your videos from the last seven days in order of newest to oldest videos. You can also see the videos that are trending on your account. These are the top nine videos with the fastest growth in view numbers over the past seven days. FollowersYou can also view your following count over time and observe the trend of your account's audience growth. You'll see an overview of the total likes, comments, and shares your videos have received. There are also analytics available for each video you share. Video analytics will help you understand how long viewers watched a video, the total views the video received, its average watch time, and more information about audience traffic.In reviewing your analytics, we recommend considering the big picture of your video performance over time. Lots of factors determine how content is recommended in the For You feed, so no one engagement metric is necessarily more important than another as you survey how your videos are performing. You should make note of high-level trends in your analytics, and broadly how audiences are engaging with your content and account – rather than focusing on a single metric (such as likes or comments) from video to video. Remember that at their core, video analytics tell a story: they represent all the ways people across the TikTok community have engaged with your creativity and self expression. As you post more videos, the numbers, stats, and graphs in your analytics will paint an image of the impact you make and the people you reach every time you share your ideas, creativity, and voice on TikTok."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/the-first-annual-kerwin-frost-telethon-supershow-goes-live-this-sunday","date":"2020-08-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"The 1st Annual Kerwin Frost Telethon Supershow goes LIVE this Sunday","text":"TikTok is a place for artists to showcase their creativity and help make a difference in their community.

Using excerpts from the tracks \"Say No to This\" and \"The Reynolds Pamphlet,\" the songs combined to create a clear story, perfect for TikTok creation. The lyrics used tell the story of Alexander Hamilton's secret affair, and his later public admission to the scandal. TikTok users followed the same concept, by using the audio to tell stories of sharing things that might better be kept private. The success of #NobodyNeedsToKnow can be attributed to the logical name that coordinated with the audio, and the ease of video creation.This trend shows us that audio still drives formats, and that concise, digestible storytelling powers trends. In addition, this continues the trend of users taking popular brands/properties and breathing new life into their content. This was an incredible trend, and incidentally, a great organic advertisement for Hamilton.

And we are building this platform for the long term. TikTok will be here for many years to come.We are shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process. For nearly a year, we have sought to engage with the US government in good faith to provide a constructive solution to the concerns that have been expressed. What we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses.We made clear our intentions to work with the appropriate officials to devise a solution to benefit our users, creators, partners, employees, and the broader community in the United States. There has been, and continues to be, no due process or adherence to the law. The text of the decision makes it plain that there has been a reliance on unnamed \"reports\" with no citations, fears that the app \"may be\" used for misinformation campaigns with no substantiation of such fears, and concerns about the collection of data that is industry standard for thousands of mobile apps around the world. We have made clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor censored content at its request. In fact, we make our moderation guidelines and algorithm source code available in our Transparency Center, which is a level of accountability no peer company has committed to. We even expressed our willingness to pursue a full sale of the US business to an American company. This Executive Order risks undermining global businesses' trust in the United States' commitment to the rule of law, which has served as a magnet for investment and spurred decades of American economic growth. And it sets a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets. We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly – if not by the Administration, then by the US courts.We want the 100 million Americans who love our platform because it is your home for expression, entertainment, and connection to know: TikTok has never, and will never, waver in our commitment to you.

People on our app value authentic content, and we do too – which is why our teams work diligently to uphold our Community Guidelines and keep misleading, harmful, or deceptive content and accounts off TikTok. To strengthen these efforts, we're announcing three new measures to combat misinformation, disinformation, and other content that may be designed to disrupt the 2020 election. We're updating our policies on misleading content to provide better clarity on what is and isn't allowed on TikTok. We're broadening our fact-checking partnerships to help verify election-related misinformation, and adding an in-app reporting option for election misinformation.We're working with experts including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to protect against foreign influence on our platform.While TikTok isn't the go-to app to follow news or politics, we're focused on supporting our users with education and authoritative information on important public issues. This is why we partnered with NAMLE to launch our latest safety video series geared towards media literacy, and we continue to provide authoritative COVID-19 information and resources for our community.Enhancing our misinformation policiesOur Community Guidelines prohibit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public, including content that misleads people about elections or other civic processes, content distributed by disinformation campaigns, and health misinformation. We always strive to be more transparent about our policies and content moderation, and today we're updating these guidelines to better reflect the scope of our existing policies. These updates were developed with industry experts, and the language reflects input from members of our Content Advisory Council.We're adding a policy which prohibits synthetic or manipulated content that misleads users by distorting the truth of events in a way that could cause harm. Our intent is to protect users from things like shallow or deep fakes, so while this kind of content was broadly covered by our guidelines already, this update makes the policy clearer for our users. We're making our policy around coordinated inauthentic behavior more transparent. Our Community Guidelines already prohibit content from disinformation campaigns, and this addition makes our stance against coordinated inauthentic behavior unambiguous: \"Do not engage in coordinated inauthentic activities (such as the creation of accounts) to exert influence and sway public opinion while misleading individuals, our community or the larger public about the account's identity, location or purpose.\"Our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service apply to everyone who uses TikTok and all content they post. We use a mix of technology and human moderation to enforce these policies, including by removing content, banning accounts, and making it more difficult to find harmful content, like misinformation and conspiracy theories, in recommendations or search. Technology helps us identify inauthentic behavior, patterns, and accounts dedicated to spreading misleading or spammy content. Our content moderation team reviews reported content, proactively identifies potential misinformation, responds to emerging trends or threats, and works with our fact-checking partners to verify whether content is false or misleading. We don't accept political ads, because the nature of paid political ads isn't something we think fits with the experience our users expect on TikTok.Expanding reporting options and fact-checking Working with misinformation, disinformation, and security experts is critical to successfully combating harmful content and accounts. In addition to our Content Advisory Council, which includes experts on deep fakes, free speech, inclusive AI, and more, we're forming important partnerships to better stay on top of emerging threats and respond quickly and responsibly.We're expanding our partnerships with PolitiFact and Lead Stories to fact check potential misinformation related to the 2020 US election. Fact-checking helps confirm that we remove verified misinformation and reduce mistakes in the content moderation process. We're building on our current partnerships with these organizations that already cover misinformation related to COVID-19, climate change, and more.In the coming weeks, we'll be adding an election misinformation option to our in-app reporting feature so that people can easily report content or accounts for review, and introducing an election information center to connect people to authoritative information.Countering foreign interference In 2018, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the Countering Foreign Influence Task Force (CFITF) as part of the National Risk Management Center within the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency. We're proud to work with the CFITF to help stop the threat and dangers of foreign influence on elections. In addition to sharing insight about possible disinformation campaigns across the industry, the task force connects local election officials with online platforms and law enforcement so that we can help protect the integrity of the vote.We're also working with a number of industry-leading threat assessment platforms to bolster our ability to detect inauthentic activity and improve our safeguards against it. Looking aheadWe're committed to being transparent about how we execute our policies and safeguard our platform. With our Transparency and Accountability Center now available for virtual tours, along with the release of regular Transparency Reports and our new Transparency webpage, we aim to give users, lawmakers, and experts unprecedented insight into how we work to keep TikTok safe and secure.Misinformation, disinformation, and threats to civic engagement are challenges no platform can ignore. By working together as an industry with experts and civil society organizations, we can better protect the civic processes that are so essential to our users. We'll continue to share updates and keep our community updated along the way."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-creators-host-airbnb-online-experiences","date":"2020-07-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok creators host Airbnb Online Experiences","text":"In recent months, the proliferation of informative, instructional, and motivational content has enlightened and engaged the TikTok community, many of whom have been 'bored in the house, bored in the house, bored' and looking to #learnontiktok. We've seen a growing interest in more enriching and useful videos - such as those that highlight life hacks like secrets to style or craft cocktail recipes - alongside the light-hearted, humorous, and fun content. TikTok creators present the content in creative and innovative ways, making learning on TikTok enjoyable. To provide our community with more ways to learn and engage with TikTok creators, we've collaborated with Airbnb to bring users a new collection of Airbnb Online Experiences, now bookable on the Airbnb app and website. Online Experiences will give users the chance to connect with their favorite creators and learn an assortment of new skills across photography, comedy and wellness from the comforts of home, and give creators the opportunity to earn meaningful income. Online Experiences now available to book on Airbnb include cooking secrets shared by My Nguyen (@MyHealthyDish), photography tips from Bonnie Rodriguez (@bonnierzm), total body burner with Trevor Bell (@TrevorBell), and more. For other Online Experiences hosted by TikTok stars, visit Airbnb Online Experiences.Collaborating with Airbnb to bring TikTok creators to Online Experiences builds upon our ongoing commitment to support our creators as they pursue opportunities to realize actual earnings for the time and care they put into creatively connecting with an audience that's inspired by their ideas. In May, we rolled out the TikTok Creative Learning Fund to help creators with the production of learning content, provide resources for learners, and introduce emerging teachers to the TikTok platform through #learnontiktok. We recently announced the TikTok Creator Fund to encourage those who dream of using their voices and creativity to spark inspirational careers. This fund will grow to over $1 billion in the US in the next 3 years, and more than double that globally. TikTok would not be the platform that it is today without the passion and dedication of our talented and diverse community of creators. The inspiring, uplifting, thought-provoking and entertaining content they create and share brings joy to millions of people around the world every day. We are excited for them to continue using their personality, talents, and creativity to spread joy on TikTok, at Airbnb Online Experiences, and beyond."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/5-tips-for-tiktok-creators","date":"2020-07-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"5 tips for TikTok creators","text":"This is part two in our blog series about the For You feed, where we’re sharing background about content, recommendations, and discovery on TikTok. For more on the For You experience, see our first post in this series.When you post a video on TikTok, it has the potential to travel to For You feeds far and wide. Every post is your chance to tell a story, share your creativity, and connect with users who share your same interests.We made the For You feed to help people discover a broad range of content that they are uniquely interested in, and to amplify the voices and creativity within our community by connecting creators with viewers who love their content. We get asked often about how you can make your videos stand out – questions about what to post, when to post, and how you can connect with viewers who love what you share. In this blog, we'll answer these questions and more, share some best tips and tricks, and bust some myths. While there's more to TikTok than making it big on For You feeds, we know that getting your videos discovered is a big part of what makes it so fun to be a creator. We hope you find these pointers helpful, and we're excited to see what you share – happy creating! Making videos that stand out Captivating videos often have lots in common: they tell stories, draw us in, and spark conversation. But what can you do to make your videos stand out from the rest? It often comes down to a few basics:Video format: Vertical videos perform best on TikTok, as do videos that are longer than five seconds. Video captions: Sometimes a great caption is just as captivating as the content of a video. Use the space in captions to add context and share more about a video.Creative effects, voice effects, and sounds: Whether you're freeze-framing, voice-overing, or dueting with a friend, creative effects and video tools can help bring your content to life. You'll find creative effects on the record video page at the bottom-left corner of your screen. Measuring video performance A great way to gauge audience interests is to review your video analytics. By switching to a Pro account, you can use our Analytics tool to gain a better understanding of content performance and engagement. Analytics offer an overview and insights on things like your weekly and monthly views, follower growth, and trending videos. So how should you use Analytics, and which metrics matter most? Consider the big picture: Lots of factors determine how content is recommended in the For You feed, so no one engagement metric is necessarily more important than another as you survey how your videos are performing. You should make note of high-level trends in your analytics, and broadly how audiences are engaging with your content and account – rather than focusing on a single metric (such as likes or comments) from video to video. Measuring performance for new videos: For You feed recommendations generally pull from videos posted within the last 90 days, and newly uploaded videos will generally see a peak in engagement soon after they've been published. If viewers continue to find your video interesting, it will continue to be recommended. Video performance extends over a couple of days, so if you don't immediately see the performance you expect, keep your video up to give it time to generate full performance results.Keeping viewers interested: Watch time factors into how a video gets recommended, so capturing viewers' attention early and maintaining it throughout makes for watchable, shareable content. Our recommendation system takes watch time as a signal that users are enjoying your content – keeping this in mind as you create will help you make videos that are deeply engaging from beginning to end and, as a result, positioned for strong performance. Connecting with the right audiencesAs you post videos and track viewer engagement, you'll start to get an idea of the content your audiences love. Once you know what resonates, you can take that as a signal about content that your audience wants more of. Put yourself in the minds of your viewers by considering how they've engaged with your videos in the past and posting videos you think they'd like to see next.To increase the likelihood that your videos will connect with the right audiences, consider the following:Hashtags: Add hashtags to your captions that are relevant to your videos so they're more likely to be found by the right audiences. More hashtags won't guarantee a broader reach, and there's only so much space in your captions, so only add hashtags that best represent what your video is about. Music and sounds: From chart-topping music to sounds made for lip-syncs, adding audio to your videos helps them stand out and connects your content with viewers who love the dances and challenges that go with the songs and sounds made popular on TikTok. Whether users save your original sound for their next video and turn it into a trend, or find your content on the Sounds search page as they scroll through results for their favorite tunes, adding sounds helps make your videos more discoverable and shareable.Experimenting with content: The amount of videos you post won't impact how your content is recommended in the For You feed, and views vary from video to video. That leaves you free to experiment, get creative, and post different kinds of content to see what resonates. So... What about #ForYou and #FYP? We all love finding out that our content has landed in someone else's For You feed, and lots of creators will include hashtags like #FYP in hopes that doing so will push their videos into more feeds. In reality, hashtags like #FYP, #ForYou, and #ForYouPage work just like all other hashtags on TikTok, so adding these to your caption won’t necessarily improve your chances of getting on someone’s For You feed. Instead, we recommend using the space in your caption to add context to your video along with hashtags that are relevant to your content. You might consider tagging another creator whose content inspired yours or is relatable to yours, or joining in on trending hashtags, which highlight trending topics or video challenges. Remember: anyone can be a creatorAbove all, remember that anyone can be a creator. On TikTok, everybody has the potential to inspire and uplift others, build community and express themselves authentically. Our platform is a space where you're free to share your ideas, start meaningful conversations, and showcase your creativity. We hope the tips we've shared here empower you to create, share, and express yourself, whether you're already a prolific creator or you're recording your first video today. We're excited to see how you use these tips to continue creating videos that inspire creativity and bring joy to audiences all around the world."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/the-weeknd-experience-on-tiktok-live","date":"2020-07-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"The Weeknd announces special 'After Hours' album experience exclusively on TikTok LIVE stream","text":"‘The Weeknd Experience’ happens as a live fan interactive & immersive XR moment on TikTok August 7th with encores to follow.We’re raising funds for the Equal Justice Initiative and donating to help challenge racial and economic injustice.TikTok is proud to debut our first-ever in-app cross reality experience, featuring The Weeknd. In partnership with XO, Republic Records, and Wave, we’re bringing you The Weeknd Experience, the very first virtual experience of one of the biggest albums of 2020 in After Hours.

The introduction of a successful new product fuels growth and dynamism in any industry. It is unfortunate for creators, brands, and the broader community that it has been years since a company came along and reimagined what a social entertainment platform could be. But TikTok did just that. TikTok brought a unique and intuitive interface. It gave creators easy, powerful tools. It also encouraged the formation of inclusive and meaningful communities. In short, TikTok brought successful competition to the marketplace. This is why I joined the company as CEO earlier this year: to help lead the next generation of creators to connect with their newly energized audience, while bringing fun entertainment to people's lives.TikTok has become the place where new music is discovered and explodes onto the scene, such as Lil Nas X's \"Old Town Road.\" During the pandemic, we saw the resonance of Curtis Roach, whose \"Bored in the House\" mantra became an anthem for putting a positive spin on tough times and helped people better cope with the lockdowns. And best of all, we witnessed many examples of families coming together to perform multi-generational song and dance, which warmed all of our hearts. With our success comes responsibility and accountability. The entire industry has received scrutiny, and rightly so. Yet, we have received even more scrutiny due to the company's Chinese origins. We accept this and embrace the challenge of giving peace of mind through greater transparency and accountability. We believe it is essential to show users, advertisers, creators, and regulators that we are responsible and committed members of the American community that follows US laws.Even more, we believe our entire industry should be held to an exceptionally high standard. That's why we believe all companies should disclose their algorithms, moderation policies, and data flows to regulators. We will not wait for regulation to come, but instead TikTok has taken the first step by launching a Transparency and Accountability Center for moderation and data practices. Experts can observe our moderation policies in real-time, as well as examine the actual code that drives our algorithms. This puts us a step ahead of the industry, and we encourage others to follow suit. Beyond our commitment to accountability, we also believe all players in the industry should make a positive impact in the community. Our $200 million Creator Fund will help American creators get the most out of TikTok, and we expect that this will grow to over $1 billion in the US in the next 3 years, and more than double that globally. In addition to supporting these creative entrepreneurs, we are also on track to create 10,000 new TikTok jobs across the US.At TikTok we welcome competition. We think fair competition makes all of us better. To those who wish to launch competitive products, we say bring it on. Facebook is even launching another copycat product, Reels (tied to Instagram), after their other copycat Lasso failed quickly. But let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor – namely Facebook – disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the US.Without TikTok, American advertisers would again be left with few choices. Competition would dry up and so too will an outlet for America's creative energy. We are not political, we do not accept political advertising and have no agenda – our only objective is to remain a vibrant, dynamic platform for everyone to enjoy. Consumers can only benefit from the growth of healthy, successful platforms like TikTok and we will fight to continue to give American creators, users and brands an entertaining outlet for many years to come. We are willing to take all necessary steps to ensure the long-term availability and success of TikTok. The one thing that will not change is our commitment to ensuring that TikTok remains a safe and secure platform for the tens of millions of American families that derive joy from it. For our skeptics, I am confident we have the answers and where we do not, we will improve. The onus is on us to step up. We are doing so, and will continue to take the bold steps needed. I accept and appreciate the challenge.TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy. The bigger move is to use this moment to drive deeper conversations around algorithms, transparency, and content moderation, and to develop stricter rules of the road. We are taking the first step of many to address these concerns, and call on the industry to follow our lead for the benefit of users and creators everywhere."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tiktok-bill-nye-garden-marcus-and-rags-2-riches","date":"2020-07-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Trending on TikTok: Wearing Masks, Garden Marcus, and Rags2Riches","text":"TikTok users have come together in support of wearing mask to protect themselves and others from COVID-19, creating the top trend, #WearAMask.

While the past few months have been challenging for many, we've been awed by the outpouring of empathy, humor, and truly uplifting content from our users. We love seeing community form on TikTok in uniquely expressive ways. The growth of relatable content, and the entertaining and refreshing experience on the app, is a direct testament to the spirit and creativity of our talented creators. That spirit and ability to connect with and bring joy to large audiences has already propelled thousands of creators into brand partnerships, sponsorships, and representation deals with some of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies.

As part of our commitment to accountability, Roland Cloutier, our Chief Information Security Officer, wrote about our ongoing review of our security infrastructure and practices. As you may know, the use of third-party SDKs (software development kits) is a common practice in the industry to foster a more convenient user experience, but we have decided to take the step of eliminating all clipboard access not explicitly requested by the user. This includes blocking SDKs that go beyond typical practices in the sector in order to give users greater peace of mind. During a recent review, we identified a few examples of third-parties, such as Facebook's SDK, attempting to access our users' clipboards, and today we sent an update to the App Store to block this kind of SDK access.I'd like to take a step back and describe how we cooperate with third-party app developers. Most apps work with a number of developers to enable people to create great content and reach larger audiences. For example, developers like Adobe or Lightricks may launch a photo template or video editing app. We partner with these trusted developers so that users can easily share content made on an outside or third-party app to TikTok.When a user wants to share content created on a third-party app, it is critical that we authenticate the outside app. This helps to protect our platform and our community from malicious actors. In the past, we used UIPasteboard in iOS to copy authentication credentials over to TikTok. These credentials included:Bundle id: the third-party app identifier with Apple;Client key and secret: unique identifiers that authorize the third-party app with TikTok; and,Unique id: an identifier provided by the third-party developer to attribute an id with the content that is being shared. This id is created by the third-party developer.We have removed the code that enabled the process described above. Moving forward, we will authenticate developers through a URL schema. We've already informed existing third-party developers of the fix, and they are working on their end to make the transition smooth. (If you are a third-party developer, please visit our TikTok for Developers website for the latest updates and news). In the meantime, users might see that they are unable to share a video or photo to TikTok until the third-party developer updates to TikTokOpenSDK 4.0.0. We recognize the extra work this creates for developers, and we appreciate their commitment to helping us protect the privacy of the TikTok community.TikTok also partners with third-party developers so that users can share TikTok videos on their social channels, such as Instagram or Snapchat. In order to make this happen, some third-party apps access a device's clipboard through an API. Starting with the new update, TikTok will only allow a third-party app to access a users clipboard when an action is expressly initiated by a user, such as sharing to Snapchat or Instagram Stories. We are building a better experience that brings joy to the TikTok community and safeguards sensitive data and information. As Roland says, security is a job that is never done, but we are going to aggressively build an experience that respects and protects our community. Thank you to our partners for helping us achieve excellence over and over."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-trends-to-binge-from-june","date":"2020-07-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok trends to binge from June","text":"People turn to TikTok to create unique, engaging content and many of those videos resonate so strongly with the community that they become TikTok trends. During June, TikTok creators used their platform to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement with footage of protests to demand justice. Hashtags like #blacklivesmatter, #blackvoicesheard, #blm, #justiceforgeorgefloyd and #protest became some of the most creation-inspiring tags.Throughout June, creators also brought levity through trends focusing on energetic puns, personal obsessions, and infectious dances that make scrolling through TikTok a positive experience. The month also saw the emergence of a fashion creator showing off lavish looks for all users. Top 3 Trends#BlackLivesMatterThroughout the nation and across the world, protests rose in support of the black community and the fight for racial equality and justice, igniting conversations about systemic racism, police brutality, and their impact on Black communities worldwide. As a platform for diverse voices and stories, the TikTok community joined the stand, and throughout June and to present day, videos related to Black Lives Matter continue to fuel conversation on the platform.Creators have been using TikTok to document the protests and educate one another through documenting their experiences and activism. It's been inspiring to see that our community feels empowered to share and learn from each other on TikTok. We're proud that #BlackLivesMatter has become one of the most viewed hashtags in TIkTok's history, showing the importance of this hisrotic movement to TikTok users and our nation as a whole. #ObsessedWithItThe #ObsessedWithIt trend tells the story of when a hobby becomes an obsession, and the creators who are happy to show off their harmless fixations. Originating with a video from @r_i_c_h_k_i_d, this trend uses a sound clip from the TLC show \"My Crazy Obsession\" to showcasesimpressive collections ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners to fastfood sauces organized by color. The trend provided a simple prompt for users to share their interests in a tongue-in-cheek way. In addition, the trend remained a no-judgemental zone as users either uploaded their own collections, or took to the commitments on individual videos to relate in their own unique ways. #DontLeaveMeOne pun is good, two puns are fun, but videos with multiple puns and over the top reactions make a trend. The #DontLeaveMe takes creative wordplay and marries it with positivity and infectious laughter creating a trend that'll leave a smile on anyones face. Modeled after a video from Josh Alfred, a comedian from Lagos, Nigeria, the trend shows creators dropping quick verbal puns, followed by the camera operator and friend chasing them and yelling \"Don't leave me!\" as a sign of support and comradery. Without the need for audio or clever editing effects, there was little barrier to entry for the average user, which prompted users from across the country to share their own puns and world play. Notable video of the month Top Effect: FlashbackDo you remember back before the flashback effect took TikTok videos to another time with wavy visual cues? Originally launched last August, Flashback was one of the first \"transition\" types of Creative Effects introduced and users initially struggled to figure out ways to make the effect work in their videos. It gained traction in June as creators used the effects with the sound \"Daddy Issues,\" based around the lyrics \"You ask me what I'm thinking about,\" which works perfectly with the effect. The effect helped visually show an entrance into creators' minds as they showed the hilarious, random things they were thinking about. June's Hottest TikTok Track: KolorsWhen @kvng.ryyy created the dance for \"Kolors\" he didn't know he'd be creating one of the biggest trends of the month. This smooth dance was picked up by Charli D'Amelio and King Science who helped propel \"Kolors\" to be the top viewed track for June. Creator Spotlight: @wisdm8Fashion creator Wisdom Kaye has grown a following of 2.8 million fans by offering engaging content showcasing unique, creative looks. He was recently profiled on Vogue for being \"the best-dressed guy on TikTok,\" in which he shared, \"what sets my page apart, and what has contributed to my growth, is that I show the limitlessness of fashion.\" Regardless of your fashion sense, Wisdom Kaye will get your attention with engaging looks."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-be-informed-series-stars-tiktok-creators-to-educate-users-about-media-literacy","date":"2020-07-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"TikTok's \"Be Informed\" series stars TikTok creators to educate users about media literacy","text":"By Stephanie Hind, Creator Management and Operations, TikTok US and Tara Wadhwa, Trust & Safety, TikTok USTikTok is fueled by viewers, doers, creators, and makers. And each day people around the world create and share millions of videos on TikTok. We love that our community feels empowered to express themselves on the platform, while also using it to learn more about the world around them. To help people explore TikTok safely, today we're proud to launch a new safety video series, called \"Be Informed,\" which shows users how to help keep TikTok a place where authentic content can thrive.The \"Be Informed\" series addresses an important building block for an informed online experience: media literacy. Being media literate means having the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using all forms of communication. The \"Be Informed\" series builds on our previous safety videos (\"You're In Control\"), a series which highlighted TikTok's safety features, to now provide advice on how to evaluate content online and use those skills and TikTok's in-app features to help protect against the inadvertent spread of misleading information. As with our \"You're in Control\" video series, the \"Be Informed\" series can be accessed directly in-app on @TikTokTips.User safety is something we take seriously and we're proud to work with experts and leading organizations, including the Family Online Safety Institute and ConnectSafely, to help guide our approach in maintaining the well-being of the community. To develop the \"Be Informed\" series, we partnered with the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE). NAMLE is a network of educators, scholars, researchers, practitioners, media makers, and thought leaders in the field of media literacy. Like NAMLE, we believe that media literacy is crucial to enhancing the online experience for everyone.\"In an increasingly digital world, it's imperative that social media platforms partner with the media literacy education community and adopt a more active role in educating their users on how to engage with and understand the content they encounter as part of their safety measures. It's been great to partner with TikTok on this important work and we're glad to see these important skills highlighted on their platform.\" - Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, Executive Director, NAMLEUser education and safety have always been important to us, and the health of our community is, too. With social distancing of top priority during the coronavirus pandemic, this series was notable as the first safety videos filmed entirely remotely. The TikTok creators we partnered with to bring this series to life all acted, took virtual direction, and filmed themselves from their homes.\"These videos, set against the backdrop of a set of infomercials, truly showcase the personality of our creators, each of whom added their own unique twists and ideas to the filming,\" said Kudzi Chikumbu, Director of Creator Community, TikTok. \" We're honored to have a creator community that cares so deeply about their TikTok community, and we hope these videos can help encourage people to think critically about what they see – whether on our app or anywhere online – in a fun, lighthearted way.\" Check out some of our most beloved TikTok creators in the \"Be Informed\" video series:\"Question the Source\" asks users to find out who is authoring the content that they see.\"Question the Graphics\" challenges the TikTok community to analyze the visual images they come across.\"Question Your Bias\" reminds users to consider how their experiences influence what they believe. \"When to Share vs. When to Report\" encourages users to reflect on whether the content they want to share, should be shared.\"Fact vs. Opinion\" helps users determine whether statements are expressing truths or beliefs.\"Not Interested\" shows users that they can control what they see.You can find the entire \"Be Informed\" video series on the @TikTokTips account, and check out the dedicated creators who participated in this project: @cosette, @gabe, @leethe4th, @chemteacherphil, @shreksdumpster, @josiah.hughes, @tylerjoe, @adamw, @spence and, of course @hi_im_chewie.\"Working on a TikTok safety video remotely was definitely a challenge I was excited to take on. The most challenging parts of shooting the safety video series remotely were mirroring the phone into the call, making sure the right people were on mute, and maintaining a strong internet connection. As this was really one of the first times any of us had done an entire remote shoot at that production level, there was definitely a learning curve!\" - @cosette\"I had never filmed with a full crew before but the experience was fantastic. Everyone was so professional and did everything to ensure filming was planned to the smallest detail and executed with precision. The most challenging aspect for me was making sure that I was listening carefully to directions and keeping my body in the right spot. I have such respect for actors and production crews now...you don’t realize how hard it is until you have to do it yourself and realize how much specific guidance is given behind the scenes and how difficult it can be to match what you’re being asked to do! The whole experience was something I’ll never forget and hope to get to experience again.\" - @chemteacherphil\"Thanks to the amazing tools provided and communication, I felt it was an effective and enjoyable collaboration. I worked on the project for two full days, setting up different shots and playing the part of an online detective. It was challenging to overcome the connection delay due to shooting in 4k, but I took the time to watch and felt confident with each completed scene before moving on. I really enjoyed working with a green screen because it allowed more creativity and imagination.\" -@gabe\"Filming content remotely is always a challenge. There were definitely a few times where I would frame up a shot, shoot, and then think that I did a great job. Then I would go back to review my footage only to find half of my body was cut out of the frame. Fail.\" - @TylerJoe"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-h-2-2019-transparency-report","date":"2020-07-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Our H2 2019 Transparency Report","text":"By Michael Beckerman, VP and Head of US Public Policy and Eric Han, Head of Safety, USToday we published our global Transparency Report for the last half of 2019 (July 1 - December 31, 2019). This report provides insight into the volume and nature of requests we receive from law enforcement bodies around the world and how we responsibly respond to them. To increase transparency into our content moderation practices and actions, we've expanded this report to include information about our approach to enforcing the policies and practices that keep TikTok a safe and authentic place for creative expression. This means we're sharing for the first time the global volume of videos removed for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, including the 5 markets with the largest volume of removed videos.BackgroundWe published our inaugural Transparency Report last December which covered the legal requests we received and our response to them during the first half of 2019. We're publishing these reports regularly and plan to provide more information in future reports as we continue to invest in our infrastructure, improve our reporting systems, and develop new safety policies, practices, and partnerships.Our approach to safety Around the world, tens of thousands of videos are uploaded on TikTok every minute. With every video comes a greater responsibility on our end to protect the safety and well-being of our users. As a global platform, we have thousands of people across the markets where TikTok operates working to maintain a safe and secure app environment for everyone. This includes our US-based safety team, which has grown considerably over the last year under the leadership of our Head of Safety for TikTok US, as well as our Trust & Safety hubs in California, Dublin, and Singapore. Our global safety teams comprise experienced industry professionals whose backgrounds span product, policy, compliance, child safety, law, privacy, and NGOs. These dedicated hubs are focused on strengthening policies, technologies, and moderation strategies and ensuring that they complement both local culture and context. Our Trust & Safety leaders collaborate closely with regional regulators, policymakers, government, and law enforcement agencies in our pursuit to promote the highest possible standard of user safety. To enforce our Community Guidelines, we use a combination of technology and content moderation to identify and remove content and accounts that don’t meet our standards. Technology: Our systems automatically flag certain types of content that may violate our Community Guidelines, which enables us to take swift action and reduce potential harm. These systems take into account things like patterns or behavioral signals to flag potentially violative content.Content moderation: Technology today isn't so advanced that we can solely rely on it to enforce our policies. For instance, context can be important when determining whether certain content, like satire, is violative. As such, our team of trained moderators helps to review and remove content. In some cases, this team proactively removes evolving or trending violative content, such as dangerous challenges or harmful misinformation. Another way we moderate content is based on reports we receive from our users. We try to make it easy for users to flag potentially inappropriate content or accounts to us through our in-app reporting feature, which allows a user to choose from a list of reasons why they think something might violate our guidelines (such as violence or harm, harassment, or hate speech). If our moderators determine there's a violation, the content is removed. We continue to educate our users about the additional options and controls available to our users by directly sharing that information through in-app safety and well-being videos and on our Safety Center. On our new Transparency webpage we also share more information about the steps we're taking to help keep our platform safe, details about our company operations, and resources like our Community Guidelines and Transparency Reports.How we enforced our Community Guidelines & Terms of ServiceAt TikTok, we celebrate creative expression, but we also prioritize protecting against harm. Taking action on content that violates our policies is a critical part of fulfilling our responsibility to our users.In the second half of last year (July 1 - December 31, 2019), we removed 49,247,689 videos globally, which is less than 1% of all the videos our users uploaded, for violating our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. Our systems proactively caught and removed 98.2% of those videos before a user reported them. And of the total videos removed, 89.4% were taken down before they received any views. Our Transparency Report provides detail on the markets with the largest volumes of removed videos.At the end of last year, we started to roll out a new content moderation infrastructure that enables us to be more transparent in reporting the reasons that videos are removed from our platform. In this report, we're sharing a breakdown of policy category violations for videos removed in the month of December under that new content moderation infrastructure. Note that when a video violates our Community Guidelines, it's labeled with the policy or policies it violates and is taken down. This means that the same video may be counted across multiple policy categories. We've since transitioned the majority of our content review queues to our new content moderation system, and our subsequent reports will include more detailed data for the full time period of each report.In addition to removing content, we continue to take meaningful steps to promote a positive platform and provide visibility into our practices. For example, this year we've introduced more sophisticated policies; created our U.S. Content Advisory Council; launched Family Pairing safety features; announced global Transparency Centers in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.; explained how videos are recommended #ForYou; joined WePROTECT Global Alliance; and announced our support for the Voluntary Principles to counter online child exploitation. Legal requests for user informationLike all internet platforms we receive legal requests for user information from government agencies around the world. Any information request we receive is carefully reviewed for legal sufficiency to determine, for example, whether the requesting entity is authorized to gather evidence in connection with a law enforcement investigation or to investigate an emergency involving imminent harm. In the second half of 2019, we received 500 legal requests for information from 26 countries, and our report details how we responded. Government requests for content removal From time to time we receive requests from government agencies to remove content on our platform, such as requests around local laws prohibiting obscenity, hate speech, adult content, and more. We review all material in line with our Community Guidelines, Terms of Service, and applicable law and take the appropriate action. If we believe that a report isn't legally valid or doesn't violate our standards, we may not action the content. During the second half of 2019, we received 45 requests to remove or restrict content from government bodies in 10 countries. Our report includes more detail. Takedowns for Infringement of Intellectual PropertyOur Community Guidelines and Terms of Service prohibit content that infringes on third party intellectual property. The creativity of our users is the fuel of TikTok. Our platform enables their self-expression to shine, and we do our best to protect it. In the second half of 2019, we evaluated 1,338 copyright content takedown notices, and our report shows how we responded. Looking aheadAs our young company continues to grow, we're committed to taking a responsible approach to building our platform and moderating content. We're working every day to be more transparent about the violating content we take down and offer our users meaningful ways to have more control over their experience, including the option to appeal if we get something wrong. We'll continue to evolve our Transparency Report to provide greater visibility into our practices and actions, and to address the feedback we hear from our users and outside stakeholders. Additionally, we're on track to open our global Transparency Centers in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. this year. These centers will provide invited experts and policymakers with an opportunity to view first-hand how our teams address the challenging and critically important work of moderating content on TikTok.Our ultimate goal is to keep TikTok an inspiring and joyful place for everyone to create."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-business-launches-new-smb-solutions","date":"2020-07-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"TikTok For Business Launches New Solutions to Help Small Businesses Connect and Grow with the TikTok Community","text":"New self-serve advertising platform now gives businesses of all sizes the resources and flexibility to engage new audiences\"Back-to-Business\" ad credit program is designed to support the small business community as they begin to rebuild for the futureToday we launched new advertising solutions to empower small and mid-size businesses to tap into the power of TikTok For Business to grow their brand.

What has been clear since I started this job almost three months ago is that the team at TikTok is fully committed to protecting the privacy of our users and providing transparency on our overall security efforts. As I wrote a few weeks ago, my team of security experts and I are undertaking a broad review of our security processes and infrastructure. With this in mind, I would like to update the community on some recent developments. First let me start with some background. Earlier this year a report noted that many prominent apps, including TikTok and other major entertainment as well as news apps, were requesting access to users' clipboards. There are many legitimate reasons why something like this would occur. For example, if you copy text for a website in one app and then open a browser, most browsers will ask if you want to paste the text and go to the URL directly. This is an example of how browsers attempt to make your user experience better, but it requires the app to know that a URL is sitting on the clipboard. There are dozens of other reasons why apps might want to see if information is sitting on a user's clipboard.In the case of TikTok, this notification had been triggered by integration of the Google Ads SDK. While this type of data was not sent to TikTok, we appreciate that this issue was confusing to many users and could have led them to believe that TikTok itself was using the data for unclear purposes. Further, the ubiquitous nature of third party ad programs helps explain why so many other apps indicated similar behavior. In response, on April 16 we updated our app so the ad program would not be able to access users' clipboards.Last week, following the launch of Beta iOS 14, TikTok users saw a similar iOS notification when they tried to type comments on a video. Users also saw notifications on a number of other popular apps. While I can't know for sure why users saw notifications for other apps, I can explain why this happened with TikTok, how this occurred shortly after a similar issue, and what we are doing to stop it again, given the perception that this type of action might compromise user security.We are constantly building new features to improve the experience on TikTok. In this case, we had been working to address the problem of spam and incidents where users sometimes post the same comments on hundreds of videos. Our technology allowed us to identify users who were copying comments and placing them over and over in the comment section for different videos. We took this as a signal that the user had an agenda, such as promoting themselves to gain followers, or trolling other users. We launched an anti-spam feature so that we could quickly detect spam and improve the experience for our community. This feature was added in the iOS version of the app released on May 22.From a technical point of view, this anti-bot defense technology performed a string matching validation from the clipboard. Its only function was to validate whether matched text inputted into the application came from the clipboard. There was no collection of any data on the clipboard, simply a validation against data input into the app, like hashing validation. In layman's terms, the anti-spam program never sent user data off the user's device. Nonetheless, we understand that the notification had the unintended consequence of making it appear as though we might be doing more with the feature. Last week we sent an update to the App Store removing this feature, and it has been resolved in version 16.6.1 of the TikTok app, which appeared in the Apple App Store on June 27. As always, we encourage all of our users to update their apps to the latest version.The anti-spam feature was never added to the Android version of the app, and we are now addressing the issue of spam in both versions through other technology that does not involve the clipboard.The anti-spam feature that was operational from May 22-June 27 is similar to other types of features that dozens, if not hundreds, of different apps have that triggered notifications from iOS 14. At the same time, we appreciate that it would have been better to avoid adding a feature that would raise questions about TikTok's access to the clipboard in any scenario, particularly so shortly after we had worked to eliminate this type of access for a different feature.We also understand that while many apps are triggering this type of notification, often for innocuous reasons, users have legitimate questions about what companies are doing with data. We fully accept that and strive to be a leader in the industry, not only working every day to protect the safety and privacy of our users, but also being transparent and forthright about our practices.With this in mind, I am leading a sprint initiative to conduct thorough, ongoing app security assessments, remediations, verifications, and pre-deployment tests and validation prevention efforts. This is the highest priority for the team, and we have the full support of our executive management team to conduct our analysis and take action. We will have a team of engineers fully dedicated to this project.Further, we are conducting a review of our feature release processes to help limit the possibility that such issues might arise in the future when we roll out new features.As part of this, we've undertaken a full review of all clipboard issues to consider other possible scenarios where this could occur. In particular, we looked at scenarios where there could be any type of clipboard access action that was not directly initiated by the user. For example, pasting information into TikTok would be a user-initiated action, and it brings value to the user. Over the next several days, we will work with our third-party partners to complete that review and confirm that no other such scenarios exist. We will report back on our findings shortly.We're committed to building an app that respects the privacy of our users and to being more transparent with our community. We'll continue to update you about ways we are improving TikTok, and later this year, we'll open our Transparency Center to give experts a behind-the-scenes look at how we keep people safe and protect their privacy. Security is a job that is never finished, but I can tell you we'll continue to aggressively build an experience that respects and protects our community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/lets-go-crazy-the-music-of-prince-comes-to-tiktok","date":"2020-06-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Let's go crazy!

Creativity is how our users express themselves, create trends, and come together as a community. TikTok celebrates storytellers, and we've witnessed the positive impact that creativity and storytelling brings to the TikTok community and the experience of our platform. Brands are an important part of the TikTok experience. Whether they are starting trends, connecting communities, or bringing awareness to critical public service initiatives, brands are creating authentic audiences built on the foundation of sharing joy. They are embracing the creative and authentic spirit of TikTok, and giving users a new way to discover and engage with the products they love.Today, we're excited to introduce TikTok For Business, our global brand and platform that is home to all current and future marketing solutions for brands. TikTok For Business solutions are designed to give brands and marketers the tools to be creative storytellers and meaningfully engage with the TikTok community.New Platform for Brands to Amplify Their Voice on TikTok Over the past year, brands have found success resonating with the TikTok community not because they had the glossiest ad or the biggest names in their campaign, but because of their ability to creatively engage and connect with users through feelings, actions and sounds. The magic of TikTok is not just the chance to create, but the chance to discover – and to be found. With TikTok For Business, our goal is to give marketers the tools to be discovered and connect with the broader communities around them. On TikTok, marketers can tap into the unique opportunities that can only be found on TikTok to connect with our community, build their brands, and achieve their goals, including:Scale & creativity: TikTok is a growing platform for marketers to leverage as a must have destination. TikTok is an entertainment based platform, offering users and brands the tools to tell their stories. Sight, motion & sound: With TikTok, the industry can build for a mobile, sound-on environment. And, there are so many opportunities for sound: music, sound effects, voice-overs, reactions and more. Inclusive & participatory community: TikTok is all about \"join.\" This presents an original opportunity for marketers to create work that becomes a part of our community. On TikTok, people can become so engaged and inspired by a marketing campaign, that they'll create their own version of it. Brands can actually experience the impact their campaigns have on people. The place where culture is made: TikTok is an open platform where anyone and any brand can be discovered. The opportunity to learn about what is happening all over the world is limitless. Culture is created in an open and inclusive way on TikTok, every day. Seamless & simple solutions: Our products deliver across every marketing touchpoint and allow for rich and immersive storytelling.

The creative, light-hearted, and fun content is so uniquely TikTok – and we've been inspired to see our community welcome a variety of content as well.For brands, this opens an entirely new window of opportunity to create content that speaks to people, to invite the community to join in the conversation, and...to Make TikToks.Creativity & ExpressionTikTok has come to represent an expression of how people are feeling and what they are experiencing. We continue to work each and every day to create a supportive environment for our community to embrace authenticity and diversity in their content. The TikTok community is constantly refining their approach to storytelling based on what they're doing and what they're seeing. With TikTok, advertisers have the opportunity to flip traditional marketing on its head, and place their brand at the forefront of innovative storytelling and creative content to connect with today’s generation.Open & AccessibleFor every voice, there is an audience. Because TikTok is an open platform where anyone can be discovered, the industry is not limited to learning only from their own friend groups or followers. Culture, trends, and content are created and shared globally, which means anything can go viral across the globe within a matter of hours and reach diverse audiences across cultures, ages, ethnic groups, and languages. TikTok is an original opportunity for brands to create great work that becomes a part of our community and the experience.Creator & Brand UnityCreators reflect the heart and soul of TikTok. The courage our diverse creator community has to bring their whole selves to their content presents a new opportunity for marketers to be real, authentic and creative. Additionally, creator collaborations with brands campaigns are a powerful way to tap into the creativity and the communities creators have built. To help foster brand and creators collaborations, TikTok is testing a platform called Creator Marketplace in select regions. On TikTok Creator Marketplace, brands can discover and partner with innovative content creators on paid brand campaigns to drive awareness and attract new customers.A Creative Place for All With the launch of TikTok For Business, we set out to embrace the creative, positive, and real moments that make our community so special with solutions for businesses to connect and grow with our wonderfully expressive community. Brands have taken notice that being yourself is good for business, and we aim to continue providing a platform so they can build a meaningful presence. We champion authenticity, creativity, and expressiveness because it's who our users are and how they stand out. As we continue to build a platform where brands bring immense value to the user experience, we're excited to continue investing in solutions that give brands a platform to inspire others, be discovered, and meaningfully connect with the TikTok Community. To learn more about TikTok For Business, visit www.tiktok.com/business."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/progress-report-how-were-supporting-black-communities-and-promoting-diversity-and-inclusion","date":"2020-06-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Progress Report: How we're supporting Black communities and promoting diversity and inclusion","text":"By Vanessa Pappas, TikTok US General Manager, and Kudzi Chikumbu, Director of Creator CommunityAs we shared in a blog post at the start of this month, racism and discrimination have no place on TikTok and we are committed to specific, concrete actions in our push toward building an inclusive platform reflective of our diverse world.Recently, we invited Black creators to share their concerns and experiences in a Town Hall with our CEO, Head of Safety, Head of Culture & Diversity, and the two of us. Our team also held a roundtable to hear the perspectives of our student ambassadors from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). In these discussions, our community has emphasized the need for TikTok to take more proactive steps against harassment, better understand cultural sensitivities, and broaden our own team's perspectives. Internally, forums with our Black employees are facilitating ongoing conversations to make sure we're aligning our on-platform and community initiatives off the platform as well.We are determined to have these important, albeit challenging, conversations – with our community and about our own company – as we take action toward fostering a strong and inclusive platform. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy through the TikTok experience, and that isn’t possible unless our users feel safe and heard on our platform. The voices, images, and emotional stories resonating on our platform and around the world are an important reminder of the responsibility TikTok has to its users.Today we want to provide an update on some of the steps in our ongoing commitment that we’ve taken so far. Introducing our Creator Diversity CollectiveTikTok creators are diverse, and want to make sure they are seen and their voices are heard. Today, we are announcing the formation of our Creator Diversity Collective, which brings people from different backgrounds together to help ensure diversity, inclusion, and representation in our programs and on our platform. These creators were chosen due to both their knowledge of TikTok and their dedication to advocating for a more inclusive platform. The inaugural members of the Collective, who will be joined by more creators of diverse backgrounds in the coming weeks, will first gather in early July and will meet regularly with TikTok employees to share the perspectives of the creator community.Welcoming Mutale Nkonde to our Content Advisory CouncilToday we are also announcing that Mutale Nkonde has joined TikTok's Content Advisory Council; she attended her first meeting yesterday, where we tackled how to appropriately handle hateful behavior. Her expertise and perspective, including her research focused on understanding racial bias in algorithms, will help us as we continuously enhance our policies to keep TikTok a safe and welcoming place for everyone.\"As TikTok becomes the online destination for Gen Zers, the construction of race and expressions of racism are becoming a foundational part of how users understand each other. I am honored to join this council to help bring attention to the challenges and opportunities this presents and ensure Black, Indigenous, and other negatively racialized young people enter an affirming and inclusive online space.\" – Mutale Nkonde, Fellow at Berkman Klein at Harvard and Fellow at Digital Civil Society Lab at StanfordUpdating and enhancing our platform and systemsWe want TikTok to be a platform that celebrates Black voices in our community, and it's critical that our product and policies treat users fairly and get continually better at protecting users from harassment. Again, racism, hate, harassment, and discrimination have absolutely no place on TikTok, and hate speech will not be tolerated on our platform. When our enforcement teams detect known hate or violent extremist groups we quickly remove the violating content, ban accounts, and work to block the spread of hate terms in search. This is a challenging area and we won't always get it right, but conversations with our community and experts like our Content Advisory Council continue to help inform our product and policies as we also invest in our ability to quickly detect and triage hateful or abusive behavior, including growing our product and engineering teams in our Trust & Safety hubs to focus specifically on enforcement efficiencies.Additionally, we're making product changes to offer clarity around content removals. We recently released a feature that notifies users if they duet or react to a video that was removed for violating our Community Guidelines. Previously, users who made duets condemning what they felt to be racist content felt betrayed to find their own video removed – as a result of the original video they duetted having been removed. We have a series of other improvements underway to improve notifications and appeals, which will begin rolling out next month.Since users spend most of their time exploring their For You feeds, last week we also took an important step in providing insight into our recommendation system to help users understand their options for shaping their unique experience. We want to be open about the inherent challenges recommendation systems face and how we work to protect against bias. Our teams are intent on developing ethical machine learning processes that reflect inclusivity and diversity, but we know there's work to be done in this area and we are committed to further research and investment toward that goal. Honoring and elevating Black history and creatorsIn celebration and remembrance of the 155th anniversary of Juneteenth, we created a dedicated page for users to learn more about the holiday and Black history through resources and informational videos from creators and social justice organizations. Following Juneteenth, this page has shifted to focusing on how systemic racism continues to impact the Black community, including highlighting videos and accounts of Black creators who are raising awareness of the issues that are important to their communities. We are mindful of the role that TikTok can play in the lives of our users, and we are committed to fostering a platform that amplifies Black voices – not just during isolated occasions, but as an ongoing part of the fabric of TikTok.Supporting organizations that fight for equalityWhile the voices of our community are powerful, we know elevating them on our platform is not enough – which is why we're also making financial contributions to organizations that fight for racial equality and justice; nonprofits that provide programs and resources to local Black communities, including empowering underserved youth, girls, and seniors and working to increase access to health care, education, financial literacy, and cultural awareness; and museums that preserve stories of courage and heroism in the Black community, stimulate open dialogue about race, and inspire everyone to take steps to learn, listen, and heal.We're contributing $2 million to organizations that work to establish and support inclusive communities across America, including the Accion Opportunity Fund, BET + United Way COVID-19 Relief Fund, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and Black Girls CODE. These organizations are also part of our employee donation-matching program, and will soon be added to our in-app Donations feature so the greater TikTok community can support them as well. We're committing $1 million to the Center for Policing Equity to help them fight for justice by condemning racism and bias in policing across the country. Our donation will support CPE’s work to give their community-based partners data-driven solutions that keep dignity and fairness at the core of public safety. We're providing $850K in microgrants to the Brooklyn Community Foundation, Chicago-based My Block My Hood My City, and The Brotherhood Crusade in South Los Angeles, and future grants will support other organizations working to undo the damage caused by systemic racism through actionable public policy.We're also supporting Black museums across the country through a donation of $150K. These donations will go to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, California African American Museum, and The Legacy Museum, founded by the Equal Justice Initiative. As we engage with our community, we continue to receive valuable feedback on how we can increase transparency, improve systems, prevent inherent bias, and amplify diverse voices – and we are hard at work on updates to that end. We realize that these are just first steps; no one action, donation, or blog post is going to fix a broken system. At TikTok, we are fully committed to supporting and promoting diverse voices and perspectives. We must be part of the solution, not the problem. We look forward to providing further updates on our progress and hearing feedback from our community in the months to come."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-after-school-all-stars-partner-to-bring-the-summer-songwriting-academy","date":"2020-06-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok and After School All-Stars partner to bring the Summer Songwriting Academy","text":"Every day, musicians on TikTok create songs that have a positive impact on people in their community and allow them to connect emotionally and creatively with an audience.

For African Americans, it marks the day in which the United States ceased its barbaric practice of legalized slavery. Sadly, this was two years after the Emancipation Proclamation had already granted that very same freedom to African Americans in January of 1863. As with most holidays, June 19, 1865 marked a pivotal moment in history: the day the last group of African Americans in Texas were notified they were no longer in bondage, effectively ending slavery in the United States. This year, on the 155th anniversary of Juneteenth, communities of all races – Black, Latinx, Native American, Asian, and countless others – will come together to celebrate, educate, and advocate. Juneteenth is a day for remembering the freedoms that are endowed to all people living in the United States. Today, users will find a dedicated page in our app filled with resources to learn more about the holiday and Black history, informational and thoughtful videos from creators, and social justice organizations that users can support by clicking the #Juneteenth banner on the Discover page. We are also partnering with BLKFREEDOM.org, a digital commemoration of Juneteenth, to connect users to this special initiative launched by six Black museums and historical institutions across the United States. The site will debut a video presentation on the significance of emancipation featuring Dr. Carla Hayden, Librarian of Congress, the first woman and the first African American to lead the national library; Dr. Johnnetta Cole, anthropologist, educator, museum director, and the first female African American president of Spelman College; and Lonnie G. Bunch III, the first African American and first historian to serve as the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The presentation will begin at 9am PT/ 12pm ET and can be accessed by clicking the Juneteenth banner.We recognize the Juneteenth holiday as a day of celebration for African Americans; a time for reflection and learning, connection and engagement, and support and action.

We're building a global community where you can create and share authentically, discover the world, and connect with others. The For You feed is part of what enables that connection and discovery. It's central to the TikTok experience and where most of our users spend their time. When you open TikTok and land in your For You feed, you're presented with a stream of videos curated to your interests, making it easy to find content and creators you love. This feed is powered by a recommendation system that delivers content to each user that is likely to be of interest to that particular user. Part of the magic of TikTok is that there's no one For You feed – while different people may come upon some of the same standout videos, each person's feed is unique and tailored to that specific individual.The For You feed is one of the defining features of the TikTok platform, but we know there are questions about how recommendations are delivered to your feed. In this post we'll explain the recommendation system behind the For You feed, discuss how we work to counter some of the issues that all recommendation services can grapple with, and share tips for how you can personalize your discovery experience on TikTok.The basics about recommendation systemsRecommendation systems are all around us. They power many of the services we use and love every day. From shopping to streaming to search engines, recommendation systems are designed to help people have a more personalized experience.In general, these systems suggest content after taking into account user preferences as expressed through interactions with the app, like posting a comment or following an account. These signals help the recommendation system gauge the content you like as well as the content you'd prefer to skip. What factors contribute to For You?On TikTok, the For You feed reflects preferences unique to each user. The system recommends content by ranking videos based on a combination of factors – starting from interests you express as a new user and adjusting for things you indicate you're not interested in, too – to form your personalized For You feed. Recommendations are based on a number of factors, including things like:User interactions such as the videos you like or share, accounts you follow, comments you post, and content you create.Video information, which might include details like captions, sounds, and hashtags.Device and account settings like your language preference, country setting, and device type. These factors are included to make sure the system is optimized for performance, but they receive lower weight in the recommendation system relative to other data points we measure since users don't actively express these as preferences.All these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.While a video is likely to receive more views if posted by an account that has more followers, by virtue of that account having built up a larger follower base, neither follower count nor whether the account has had previous high-performing videos are direct factors in the recommendation system.Curating your personalized For You feedGetting startedHow can you possibly know what you like on TikTok when you've only just started on the app? To help kick things off we invite new users to select categories of interest, like pets or travel, to help tailor recommendations to their preferences. This allows the app to develop an initial feed, and it will start to polish recommendations based on your interactions with an early set of videos. For users who don't select categories, we start by offering you a generalized feed of popular videos to get the ball rolling. Your first set of likes, comments, and replays will initiate an early round of recommendations as the system begins to learn more about your content tastes.Finding more of what you're interested inEvery new interaction helps the system learn about your interests and suggest content – so the best way to curate your For You feed is to simply use and enjoy the app. Over time, your For You feed should increasingly be able to surface recommendations that are relevant to your interests.Your For You feed isn't only shaped by your engagement through the feed itself. When you decide to follow new accounts, for example, that action will help refine your recommendations too, as will exploring hashtags, sounds, effects, and trending topics on the Discover tab. All of these are ways to tailor your experience and invite new categories of content into your feed.Seeing less of what you're not interested inTikTok is home to creators with many different interests and perspectives, and sometimes you may come across a video that isn't quite to your taste. Just like you can long-press to add a video to your favorites, you can simply long-press on a video and tap \"Not Interested\" to indicate that you don't care for a particular video. You can also choose to hide videos from a given creator or made with a certain sound, or report a video that seems out of line with our guidelines. All these actions contribute to future recommendations in your For You feed. Addressing the challenges of recommendation enginesOne of the inherent challenges with recommendation engines is that they can inadvertently limit your experience – what is sometimes referred to as a \"filter bubble.\" By optimizing for personalization and relevance, there is a risk of presenting an increasingly homogenous stream of videos. This is a concern we take seriously as we maintain our recommendation system.Interrupting repetitive patternsTo keep your For You feed interesting and varied, our recommendation system works to intersperse diverse types of content along with those you already know you love. For example, your For You feed generally won't show two videos in a row made with the same sound or by the same creator. We also don't recommend duplicated content, content you've already seen before, or any content that's considered spam. However, you might be recommended a video that's been well received by other users who share similar interests.Diversifying recommendations Diversity is essential to maintaining a thriving global community, and it brings the many corners of TikTok closer together. To that end, sometimes you may come across a video in your feed that doesn't appear to be relevant to your expressed interests or have amassed a huge number of likes. This is an important and intentional component of our approach to recommendation: bringing a diversity of videos into your For You feed gives you additional opportunities to stumble upon new content categories, discover new creators, and experience new perspectives and ideas as you scroll through your feed. By offering different videos from time to time, the system is also able to get a better sense of what's popular among a wider range of audiences to help provide other TikTok users a great experience, too. Our goal is to find balance between suggesting content that's relevant to you while also helping you find content and creators that encourage you to explore experiences you might not otherwise see. Safeguarding the viewing experienceOur recommendation system is also designed with safety as a consideration. Reviewed content found to depict things like graphic medical procedures or legal consumption of regulated goods, for example – which may be shocking if surfaced as a recommended video to a general audience that hasn't opted in to such content – may not be eligible for recommendation. Similarly, videos that have just been uploaded or are under review, and spam content such as videos seeking to artificially increase traffic, also may be ineligible for recommendation into anyone's For You feed.Improving For YouDeveloping and maintaining TikTok's recommendation system is a continuous process as we work to refine accuracy, adjust models, and reassess the factors and weights that contribute to recommendations based on feedback from users, research, and data. We are committed to further research and investment as we work to build in even more protections against the engagement bias that can affect any recommendation system. This work spans many teams – including product, safety, and security – whose work helps improve the relevance of the recommendation system and its accuracy in suggesting content and categories you're more likely to enjoy.Ultimately, your For You feed is powered by your feedback: the system is designed to continuously improve, correct, and learn from your own engagement with the platform to produce personalized recommendations that we hope inspire creativity and bring joy with every refresh of your For You feed.Note: At the TikTok Transparency Center in Los Angeles, invited experts will have the opportunity to learn how our algorithm operates along with reviewing TikTok source code, which will be made available at the center for testing and evaluation."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video","date":"2020-06-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Product tutorial: Reply to comments with video","text":"TikTok is built upon the foundation of creative expression and we want to provide our users with the creative tools to make it easy to produce fun, joyful content on the app. This post is part of our TikTok Tutorial Series, where we spotlight our newest or little-known product features to educate users on how to use our tools in the TikTok creative suite and improve their content creation. There's nothing quite like the connection between creators and their fans.

While this delay was ongoing, a user who was considering adding a hashtag to a post they were composing would be shown a view count result of 0 views, even if there were billions of views. This display issue - which impacted a total of 225,611 unique hashtags, but could have impacted any searched hashtag - was due to inefficiencies in our data stream flushing service design.Today, we want to clarify exactly what happened, how it happened, and why it happened. We'll go into details on how our system returns information on hashtags to users, what we did to fix the issue in the short term, and how we're going to ensure that this problem doesn't happen again.How did we learn about the issue?On May 28th, 2020, we learned through user reports that view counts on a large number of hashtags – including #georgefloyd and #blacklivesmatter – were showing 0 views in the Compose screen (where users prepare their post before uploading).What did we find out?Upon hearing about the issue, we began exploring the two paths that would be most likely to cause this error: (1) an issue in the code or (2) a data loading or lagging issue. We found that:(1) The code was bug free and provided eventual consistency. (2) There was a lag in the data-stream that counts the number of times a video is viewed.What did the data lag look like?When we say we had a lag in a data-stream, we mean some data was so backed up that it needed to be queued to be consumed called. Normally, we calculate the computing power needed so as to consume the queued data with little to no delay or lag time. In this case, as shown in the above graph, the queued unprocessed hashtag data piled to some millions in scale, which still needed to be processed one-by-one, causing a lot of data to not be able to be pushed online/back to the user. Eventually the server might have returned a value to the user, but it would have taken several days, at which point the view count it displayed would also have been out of date.In the above graph you can also see several peaks and valleys to the data consumption slopes. While this might appear as though the issue was resolving itself every few days, this is actually a self-protection mechanism of the data-stream infrastructure: When the lagging is too devastating to the data stream, it will decide to abandon all the lagged data and start all over again, which is why we see a regular peak and then suddenly the lag would fall down to 0. This caused the lag to be longer.Why did the hashtag count view data pile up?To understand how the hashtag count view data piled up, we need to look at how hashtag count view searches work under normal circumstances and how the data is consumed:If the system is working correctly, the request for the hashtag works through a server proxy and a data stream flushing service - the process of the data stream system consuming the queued data - that keeps the entire system moving quickly. Ideally, this will return a value immediately. Generally speaking, a one-to-one mapping check that includes a data flushing service is always much faster than a thorough search (including indexing, matching, ranking etc.). In this case, and for a period of time, the data flushing failed, which caused the data lag, and the system to assume there was no value to return (or 0 views).What happened that caused the data flushing system to fail?The system is supposed to support global hashtag flushing, and it flushes every attribute of a hashtag nearly 150 times (one country a time). This is unnecessary because most of the attributes stay the same among all countries(eg: plaintext, hashtag-ids), and can cause lags, like the one that caused this issue.So how did we fix it?Once our engineering team ascertained that the issue was caused by the data stream flushing not working, we fell back to a thorough search procedure to normalize the query and back search the hashtag library. This meant essentially cutting out the mapping data and the data stream flushing, and focusing on pulling the data in plaintext and then communicating between the server proxy and the hashtag library to get the proper hashtag ID and therefore view count. It looks something like this:As mentioned above, this method is slower, but in this case it was effective in more quickly, accurately pulling the view counts for hashtags in the Compose screen. Unfortunately, switching to plaintext didn't solve the problem for all other case changed version of a hashtag. This meant that if you attempted to put in #GeorgeFloyd or #BlacklivesMatter you would see a 0 view value. This happens because we store all of our plaintext hashtags in lowercase.How did we solve the uppercase issue?We solved the upper and multi-case issue by normalizing all plaintext, case-sensitive permutations to lowercase before our system counted them in the hashtag library, and then doing a final check and accounting before returning to the user. It looks something like this: So, now the server has multiple checkpoints where it normalizes the plaintext query entered by the user to lowercase before sending it to be counted from the hashtag library, then checks if the result returned by the recommendation side has a corresponding lowercase version. This helps ensure that every time a user enters a hashtag in the Compose screen they are seeing every view of that hashtag.What's next?We've explored the design of our data stream flushing and found inefficiencies. We're upgrading the design to eradicate this issue. Specifically, the new system will recognize identical attributes and not flush redundantly. So, if an attribute is the same among all countries, we will flush it only once instead of 150 times (per country). This will allow us to process faster than before while using far less computing resources, meaning we shouldn't see a lag issue like this again.Moreover, as an extra layer of precaution, we will be increasing our monitoring, which will notify us of delays in data stream processing early on and help us correct these issues as they arise."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-trends-to-binge-from-may","date":"2020-06-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok trends to binge from May","text":"Every month, people turn to TikTok to create unique, engaging content. Many of those videos resonate so strongly with the community that they become TikTok trends. Throughout May, TikTok users have found creative ways to stay active and express themselves by showcasing clean transitions, looking at old friendships, and giving us an inside look at the houses they've been spending all their time in during the pandemic. They've continued to stay connected with each other through moments that highlight their personalities while they're social distancing in their homes. Toward the end of May, the TikTok community also showed their support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Footage of protests to demand justice began to grow organically on the platform in late May, and become a powerful movement heading into June. Hashtags like #blacklivesmatter, #blackvoicesheard, #blm, #justiceforgeorgefloyd and #protest became some of the most creation-inspiring tags. We'll explore this deeper in next month's report.Below we take a look at some of the trends from May, along with a creative effect that brought the 2020 yearbook to TikTok, and spotlight a creator who's using his animation skills to make a splash on the app. Top 3 Trends#WipeItDownThe #WipeItDown challenge brought together a catchy song, seemless transitions, and unique characters to create a Trend that took over TikTok. Built around the song \"Wipe it Down' from BMW KENNY, users showed themselves wiping down a mirror as their normal selves, before wiping up and revealing themselves in an alternate outfit or costume. Initially, the trend developed within the Cosplay community on TikTok, but quickly spread across the app being used by everyday users, top creators, and notable celebrities like Jason Derulo. #GonnaBeFriendsEvery friendship has a story and May's #GonnaBeFriends trend told the tale of countless creators meeting their besties and developing relationships that'll last a lifetime. Built around a popular song from The White Stripes set to the lyrics \"I can tell that we are going to be friends,\" creators made a montage of old videos and photographs from the time they met their best friend - and sometimes a little more than friends. From enduring lifelong friendships to couple goals, this heartwarming trend showed us that the best ship is friendship. #MyCrib\"Whatup MTV, welcome to my crib!\" These are all words we've dreamed of saying and with the #MyCrib trend, dreams became reality. Creators began showing off their homes during quarantine and thanks to a partnership with MTV, they were able to add authentic sounds and logos from the actual MTV Cribs show! From custom house buses to stylish studios and aggressively high tech houses these cribs show us that home decor can fit in any space. The most watched video of the month Top Effect: Yearbook 2020As users were stuck inside for the last part of the schoolyear, TikTok helped bring a bit of normalcy to this abnormal time with the Yearbook 2020 effect. Designed to mimic the appearance of high school yearbooks, the Creative Effect also leveraged the format of popular \"randomization filters\" to give out superlatives. This effect was launched during TikTokGraduation programming and became a popular trend when users paired it with the song \"Movin' Right Along\" by Fozzie Bear and Kermit the Frog from The Muppets. With everyone from Charli D'Amelio, to David Dobrik, Emma Chamberlain, and Brittany Broski taking part in #Yearbook2020, this effect brought us into summer laughing. May's Hottest TikTok Track: Party GirlStarting as a popular dance trend being performed by users and collab house members across TikTok, \"Party Girl\" by StaySolidRocky became the anthem of a good-natured essential worker that stole our hearts. Creator Spotlight: @king.scienceFocused on animation, the 20-year-old King.Science creates colorful, imaginative videos set to popular songs and comedic sounds. He also blends his live action footage with animation to bring his cartoons into the third dimension. With his trippy vibes and unique style, it's easy to get lost in the videos made by this talented creator."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-security-and-data-privacy-roadmap","date":"2020-06-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"TikTok's security and data privacy roadmap","text":"By Roland Cloutier, TikTok Chief Information Security OfficerWhen people think of TikTok, two words come to mind: creativity and joy. My goal is to add safety to that list. As I wrote in April, TikTok has always been committed to protecting the privacy of our community, but security is a job that is never done. We must always strive to do better and evolve to overcome the next set of industry challenges. With this in mind, my team of security experts and I are undertaking a broad review of TikTok's security infrastructure and practices. In the months since we began this review, we've created a Security Roadmap to help us build best-in-class security infrastructure, champion transparency and accountability, and partner with third-party experts and regulators to validate our progress. We are working on these focus areas simulataneously and will update you on our progress as we go along.Build best-in-class security infrastructurePeople are the foundation of any organization. We're focused on hiring the world's top security experts to lead our efforts, while also expanding our security teams who work out of Mountain View, California and Washington, D.C. Our goal is to hire an additional 100 security, data, and privacy protection experts in the U.S. by the end of the year. We are creating a centralized global security function, headquartered out of the U.S. and internationally deployed across all markets we serve. This will ensure consistency, availability, and faster responses to emerging global issues and threats to our users and platform. We will also expand our response efforts in Europe, the Middle East and Asia to further supplement ongoing and future security initiatives. The key areas of focus will be cyber defense and user-data access assurance, digital crimes, insider threat, cyber-threat intelligence, and risk management.Champion transparency and accountabilityIn March, we announced the opening of our Transparency Center in Los Angeles, California. I'm excited to share with you that we will also open a Transparency Center in Washington, D.C. Both of these centers will give lawmakers and experts the opportunity to look under the hood of TikTok and assess our security practices and infrastructure.In addition, we will release a Transparency Report twice a year, providing more information on accounts that we have taken down for violations against our terms of service, unlawful acts, and issues that threaten the safety of users. Partner with third-party experts and regulators to validate our progressWhile we have worked very hard to build best-in-class security infrastructure, we know that it's not enough to build it. We have to test it, validate it and work with our partners to make sure we're addressing the entirety of the threat surface we face every day. We must challenge our own concepts on vulnerabilities and our ability to defend against them. To that end, have been working with leading global security firms to ensure we comply with globally recognized security control standards like ISO 27001, SOC2, and NIST CSF. In the coming months, we'll announce more partnerships with security experts and regulators to ensure our community can trust that their data and privacy are protected. We'll continue to make improvements to our security program, and we'll update you every step of the way. In the meantime, if you have questions or concerns, please let us know. We're here for you."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/blackout-tuesday-theshowmustbepaused","date":"2020-06-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Blackout Tuesday","text":"By TikTok's Music TeamToday TikTok is observing Blackout Tuesday, standing in solidarity with the Black community of artists, creators, and the music industry as a whole against the horrendous recurrence of injustice in the long fight against inequality, racism, and violence. This is not a day off, but a day of action. There will be no playlists or campaigns on TikTok's Sounds page today out of respect for the movement. The effect that Black music, artists, and creators have on TikTok is undeniable. TikTok is proud to be a platform and community where Black music thrives, talent is discovered, and creativity flourishes. Yesterday we shared that TikTok is providing support in honor of our Black creators by donating $3 million from our Community Relief Fund to non-profits that help the Black community, which has been disproportionately affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unequivocally, we believe the strength in diversity of our community is what makes our platform such an amazing and wonderful place. We take great pride and responsibility in knowing that we provide underrepresented communities a platform to be seen and heard. We've been reflecting on how we can do better and wanted to share an update.First, to our Black community: We want you to know that we hear you and we care about your experiences on TikTok. We acknowledge and apologize to our Black creators and community who have felt unsafe, unsupported, or suppressed. We don't ever want anyone to feel that way. We welcome the voices of the Black community wholeheartedly. On May 19, Black creators and allies took an important stance in changing their profile pictures and connecting on the platform to speak out against how they feel the Black community has been marginalized on TikTok. And at the height of a raw and painful time, last week a technical glitch made it temporarily appear as if posts uploaded using #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd would receive 0 views. This was a display issue only that widely affected hashtags at large, and powerful videos with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag continued to be uploaded, viewed, and engaged with – in fact, videos with these hashtags have currently generated well over 2 billion views, which is a testament to their importance to and resonance among our community. Nevertheless, we understand that many assumed this bug to be an intentional act to suppress the experiences and invalidate the emotions felt by the Black community. And we know we have work to do to regain and repair that trust.Our platform exists to create joy and inspiration, and that is made better because of our diverse community of users, creators, partners, artists, and employees. It's important to us that nobody feels unwelcome, unheard, or unsafe on TikTok. We are inspired by our Black creators, artists, and partners who have touched so many people across the country and around the world. Without them, TikTok would not be the joyful and creative community we aspire to be.We also fully acknowledge our responsibility to not simply wish for and talk about the importance of diversity on our platform, but to actively promote and protect it. We share in the pain our country is in, and it is palpable across our TikTok communities. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Black community and, as we write this, our teams are working on ways to elevate and support Black voices and causes.At TikTok, creating a positive experience for people is at the heart of everything we do. Our Community Guidelines exist to protect users against harm and to foster an environment where people of all backgrounds feel safe, supported, and empowered to share and create. Racism and hate speech are not tolerated on TikTok and expressly violate our guidelines. We use technology and a dedicated team of human moderators to remove content that violates these guidelines, but we know that our systems are not perfect and we want users to flag content they feel violates those standards so we can take appropriate action. We want to emphasize that nothing in our Community Guidelines seeks to discriminate against any creator nor diminish diversity on our platform, but we are committed to constantly examining our policies and practices to make sure they do not inadvertently limit exposure for creators based on who they are. We want to share some of the actionable steps we are taking to foster an inclusive environment on our platform:Investing in our technology and moderation strategies to better handle potentially violative content, and designing a clearer, more user-friendly appeals processEstablishing a creator diversity council and impact-driven programs geared towards recognizing and uplifting the voices driving culture, creativity, and important conversations on the platformFurthering the efforts of our internal diversity task force and engaging organizations and experts to analyze how our products and policies can better serve people of all backgroundsDeveloping a creator portal to expand communication channels with and opportunities for our broader creator communityThese are long-term and ongoing measures we hope will effect change on our platform, and we recognize that real commitment requires years of engaging and listening. However, the near-term matters too. Tomorrow, we will stand in solidarity with the Black community and the music industry by participating in Blackout Tuesday, when we will turn off all playlists and campaigns on our Sounds page to observe a moment of reflection and action. We are proud and inspired that TikTok is a platform where Black music thrives and is discovered, and throughout Black Music Month we'll be offering special programming to celebrate and highlight Black artists' contribution to music on our platform. We are committed to supporting and uplifting the artists and creators who bring new music, shape culture, and help build our community.We are also providing support in honor of our Black creators by donating $3 million from our Community Relief Fund to non-profits that help the Black community, which has been disproportionately affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is just a first step, and we will further develop our ongoing efforts in this space as we work to support underrepresented groups as a whole.We continue to work each and every day to create a supportive environment for the Black community and everyone across the world. Ultimately, our goal is for TikTok to feel like home for people everywhere. We appreciate being held accountable. We know that getting to a place of trust will take work, but we are dedicated to doing our part as we continue to foster a space where everyone is seen and heard."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/aapi-heritage-month-2020-recap","date":"2020-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"What we learned from AAPI Heritage Month","text":"By Joyce Chun, Creator Marketing, TikTok USOur TikTok community encompasses unique individuals who share content inspired by different backgrounds, ideas, and experiences – and for that we are immensely lucky because we are all made better by that, every day. We value that diversity of experience every day, but May – Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month – was a wonderful time to celebrate, listen to, and learn from our AAPI community.At TikTok, we celebrate the differences and uniqueness that make up our community. Our AAPI creators are diverse, talented, and inspired by each other, and we‘re honored to have shared this special month with them. Here's a look at how we celebrated AAPI Heritage Month together. We kicked off the month by launching the #AAPIFamily hashtag, and we were inspired to see our creators using it to express the importance of their cultures. Now more than ever, it's important for AAPI creators to have a safe space to share their stories and experiences. We invites several of our creators to take over TikTok’s Instagram channel, where we learned:...that @arbacn is inspired by how so many AAPI creators on TikTok broke from traditional paths to pursue their dreams....how @jacksontkim grew up in Oʻahu, Hawaii, which he credits as influential because it gave him the opportunity to interact with people from different backgrounds and perspectives.We also hosted a week of nightly livestreams that gave viewers a chance to cook with @Mrs_dee_penda, get fit with Saweetie, hear music from @88Rising, watch magic tricks from @seandoesmagic , and chat with @daxnewman769.It warms our heart to see our communities thrive and connect both in our app and off-platform. As AAPI Heritage Month drew to a close, we hosted our first virtual event, connecting 100 AAPI creators to discuss topics ranging from the importance of authenticity to how to build a personal brand.The first session, \"TikTok is Here For (The Real) You,\" focused on the incredible value of having diverse communities on TikTok and the importance of creating and sharing content that is authentic to each unique creator. @matt shared with the group that even though his family and friends don't always understand social media platforms, he feels his dedication will pay off and that his work \"can be in the same level as being a doctor.\"In \"Find Your Niche,\" creators were treated to a fireside chat with @alanchikinchow and Patrick Starrr (@patrickstarrr) centered around activities and discussions to help creators think about personal branding and reflecting on how their unique qualities can set them up for success. Patrick stressed the necessity of self-reflection before developing content, giving this advice: \"Find something about you—whether it's your hair color, your aesthetic, or the way you speak—this is what we call pillars. Find these pillars in your DNA and stick to them. If you have a unique voice and point of view, that will make your content stand out.\"The next day's session, \"Build It with TikTok,\" featured discussions with TikTok growth strategists, creators, and artists about how creators can leverage insights to build thriving careers through TikTok. The powerful lineup of speakers included Chriselle Lim (@chrisellelim), Maia (@mxmtoon), and Tim Chantarangsu (@timchantarangsu).For Maia, TikTok helps level the playing field for artists. She noted, \"The thing about TikTok is that everyone can be a part of something. What's so beautiful about the app is how it's brought down a lot of the walls within the music industry. And sometimes the things you want to achieve are out of reach because you don't have the right people backing you. You can be an artist in a bedroom making music and have the same chance for your song to go viral as if you have a major label backing you.\"Chriselle recommended that creators find joy as they make their content. \"You truly have to love the work that you're doing. Creating content is what I'm here for and that's what keeps me going. There are definitely days I need a break from it, but I think it's important to remember for all of us that it's more about being in the moment of something you truly love than the end product.\" -Chriselle LimFor @timchantarangsu, resilience and consistency are key. \"A lot of people get messed up when they start second guessing themselves. You have to be ready and prepared for rejection and a long period of no views and no money. If you really wanna pursue it, put in the time and energy.\"The webinar series wrapped up with \"A Seat at the Table,\" an inspiring fireside chat with beauty entrepreneur Michelle Phan (@themichellephan) and creator Zahra Hashimee (@muslimthicc) that centered around how crucial representation is. Both creators discussed how seeing people who looked like them do innovative work fueled their desire to break away from traditional careers—and they shared their hopes to inspire future generations within the #AAPI community themselves. Michelle shared how seeing images she could relate to helped fuel her passion to create. \"When I was growing up as a teenager, I didn't see anyone who I could look up to. I had to conform with my environment. In America, I felt like I needed to be more Caucasian. I grew up in the era of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. The creator of Sailor Moon inspired me to follow my creative interests by creating a category of 'magical girls.' She was young; she was Asian; she was my influencer growing up. She inspired me to get into astrology, anime, manga—this whole world where I don't know where I would be today.\"With many AAPI colleagues on the TikTok team, AAPI Heritage Month was a labor of love and pride. Thank you to all of the AAPI creators who participated and the users who tuned in.This month has given us the opportunity to reflect on how Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have contributed to our country's history and culture. We've been inspired by the strength of our AAPI creators' voices, and this celebration was a testament to the importance of embracing diversity in our communities. And although AAPI Heritage Month is celebrated once a year, we believe the creators and content from this community deserve to be recognized throughout the year."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/investing-to-help-our-community-learn-on-tiktok","date":"2020-05-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Investing to help our community #LearnOnTikTok","text":"By Bryan Thoensen, Head of Content Partnerships, TikTok USAs communities continue to shelter at home, communities on TikTok have come together to offer levity, positivity, and basic human connection.

Over the past month TikTok users have found creative ways to stay active and express themselves by using the daily tasks of staying home, watching TV, and playing videogames as the source of inspiration. They've connected with each other through common interests and used humor to poke fun at their current living conditions and congregate virtually around their favorite moments in pop culture. These top trends reveal a common thread of experience among users as they turn lemons into lemonade to stay happy at home. That plus we look at how one creative effect is letting users dance in the palm of their hand and shine a light on one creator who's vegan recipes and loving attitude have helped her become TikTok's caring mom. Top 3 Trends#RandomThingsWhen @her.atlas posted a video titled \"Random Things in my Japanese home that just make sense!\" she didn't know she would start one of the biggest trends of 2020 so far. The American expat living in Japan toured her home, describing the unique characteristics of Japanese homes that many users in the US might be unfamiliar with, including vented doors in kitchens and the use of sliding doors to maximize hallway space. The initial post was well received by the TikTok community, prompting @her.atlas to continue to series and other TikTok creators to make their own #RandomThings videos. With both earnest and sarcastic replications of the format, users have showcased their own homes with videos including \"random things in their college apartments,\" to \"random things that absolutely don't make sense.\" #TigerKingTiger King hit Netflix at a moment when we needed an escape from the banality of indoor living and the popularity of the show tore into TikTok like it was expired meat from a Walmart truck. As soon as users finished binge watching the show, they took to TikTok with memes, songs, and hilarious takes on the big cat collectives. One of the first videos on the topic, by user @taystern, shared the results of her family throwing a Tiger King-themed dinner. TikTok and Netflix worked together to have #TigerKing on the Discover tab and classics like the \"Carol Baskin Savage Remix\" were born. The hype from Tiger King has spilled across the internet with TikTok being the Tiger King king. #AnimalCrossingNintendo released it's newest instalment of Animal Crossing when homebound consumers needed a way to spend their newfound free time. The latest release in an extremely popular series, the TikTok community has embraced the game and created a massive amount of content related to the title including remixing a song from the game, showing off building skills, or using characters to participate in other trends. #AnimalCrossing and #acnh tags. The most watched video of the month Top Effect: Freeze FrameThis month, #FreezeFrame jumped into the top as this months-old Creative Effect finally thawed out and heated up like that frozen lasagna you've been saving. Extremely simple to use, the Creative Effect allows a user to 'freeze' their video while recording, maintaining a consistent background which they're then able to interact with, similar to Green Screen. Once users discovered how the effect could be used for memes, creativity took over launching a slew of unique videos like this one from Dillon Francis. Video creation with the Freeze Frame effect has evolved into users dancing on their own hands, recreating film studio logos, or just \"looking like quarantine snacks.\" This Month's Hottest TikTok Track: Toosie SlideToosie Slide's \"left foot, right foot\" lyrics inspired a simple dance trend that sent the track soaring with 1b views within a week on TikTok driving Drake's song to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Creator Spotlight: @iamtabithabrownVegan chef and well-loved personality Tabitha Brown connected with 1.7M followers over the last few months after the surging popularity of her cooking videos. Her rapid rise on TikTok also landed her a deal with top talent agency CAA. With her soothing voice and positive attitude it's easy to see why users love TikTok's mom, but that's their business."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-celebrates-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2020","date":"2020-05-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok Celebrates Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month","text":"Every May, the U.S. celebrates Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month to recognize the rich cultural history and impact the AAPI community has made.

But with stay at home orders and social distancing, some people are missing their yearly dose of the great outdoors. That's why we're bringing nature indoors with #NatureAtHome. We're showcasing the natural world with continuous TikTok LIVE streams, augmented reality (AR) animal effects, and hashtags to inspire nature-themed content during this beautiful time of year. Whether you're staying inside or sitting on your back porch, TikTok has wildlife that'll brighten your day. We've partnered with explore.org, the world's largest live nature network, to bring users a nonstop stream that shows several of the diverse, interesting species found around the world. Unlike standard livestreams, these \"zen dens\" will run constantly through the week giving users something to tune into whenever they want. You can access these streams from the Discover tab or explore.org's TikTok profile. Animals being streamed include: Decorah Eagles Homosassa Manatees Underwater Happiness Village PandasTembe Elephant ParkGrace GorillasNorthern Lights in the evening if visibleAfter you've spent all day watching cuddly pandas on a LIVE stream, we think it's time to bring nature to life with AR animals. Powered by TikTok's AR technology, this creative effect lets you add extinct or endangered animals like a dinosaur, sea turtle, or a monkey directly into your video.

People are asking tough questions of internet companies – and that’s a good thing. Since its creation, TikTok has been focused on protecting our users and building out an outstanding security team. However, we fully appreciate that the work of securing a global community of users is never done. We must constantly strive to do better and evolve to meet the next set of challenges.That means looking both backwards and forwards. Looking backwards means re-evaluating security practices that may have made sense when the platform was smaller, but which may no longer work at our current scale. Companies get into trouble when they assume that systems, technologies, policies, and practices that were sufficient at one point in time will work forever. That’s rarely the case. Companies change, threats change, and security practices must adapt or risk falling behind.Looking forward means trying to anticipate where the security needs of our community are going. That isn’t easy. Six months ago, nobody would have guessed that programs like #HappyAtHome would be viewed billions of times as a tool to help people cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, or that people would be coming to TikTok not just for playful videos, but also for crucial content from health organizations. My team is laser-focused on building out our advanced security infrastructure, designing relevant programs, and engaging with the broader industry to further develop our capabilities, and lead as our sector continues to evolve and change.With those goals in mind, in the weeks since I began, my team and I have been undertaking a broad review of TikTok’s security, our infrastructure and practices, testing current practices and actively seeking to anticipate what we will need in the future. As I begin my work at TikTok, I am excited for the new challenge and appreciate how much everyone on the team has made it clear that security is a top priority for the company. Let me take this chance to highlight a few areas where we are going to focus:We are engaged with the world's leading cyber security firms to accelerate our work advancing and validating our adherence to globally recognized security control standards like NIST CSF, ISO 27001 and SOC2.Transparency is the foundation of our next generation security programs underway here at TikTok, as we continue to work hard to earn our community's trust. Our Cyber Defense, Security Assurance, and Data Protection programs will be front and center in our new Transparency Center that we recently announced. Similar to industry peers, we will continue to drive our goal of limiting the number of employees who have access to user data and the scenarios where data access is enabled. Although we already have controls in place to protect user data, we will continue to focus on adding new technologies and programs focused on global data residency, data movement, and data storage access protections worldwide. Our goal is to minimize data access across regions so that, for example, employees in the APAC region, including China, would have very minimal access to user data from the EU and US. In the same way that I hope we all continue to wash our hands thoroughly long after the COVID-19 crisis has ended, so too will we continue to advance the protection and privacy of your data. That’s how together we can take some important lessons from this terrible crisis and use them to build a better, more secure future for us all."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-continued-support-for-families-in-need","date":"2020-04-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Our continued support for families in need","text":"By Vanessa Pappas, General Manager, TikTok US Earlier today we launched TikTok Donation Stickers, which let users make a positive impact through the TikTok app through a direct opportunity to join us in supporting communities affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

From the moment a friendly restaurant host greets you to the impeccable dining experience a waiter provides, the beautiful meal crafted by the chef, and the dishwashers and bussers that help re-set tables for hungry guests, it truly takes a village to keep the restaurant industry running like a well-oiled machine.Today, the coronavirus pandemic has deeply affected many in the industry as restaurants, bars, and other independent food and beverage operations nationwide have been forced to close. It's critical to us to support an industry that has brought so much joy and connection to our communities, and we are proud to donate $4 million to the service industry – providing $2 million each to the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation (NRAEF) Restaurant Employee Relief Fund (RERF) and the James Beard Foundation Food and Beverage Industry Relief Fund.The James Beard Foundation Food and Beverage Industry Relief Fund aims to provide critical financial assistance to small, independent restaurants who have an immediate need for funds to pay set operating expenses and keep from going out of business.“We are incredibly grateful for TikTok’s generous donation and support during this challenging time,” said Kris Moon chief operating officer of the James Beard Foundation. “With this donation we will continue to provide the financial relief necessary to prevent the closure of independent food and beverage businesses, some of which wouldn’t be possible without donations of this magnitude.”The NRAEF’s Restaurant Employee Relief Fund (RERF) supports U.S. restaurant workers financially impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, and industry icon Guy Fieri has led a nationwide fundraising drive for the Fund via a Restaurant Relief America campaign. Fieri is the renowned chef, restaurateur, author, and Emmy Award Winning television Host of the Food Network’s Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The restaurant industry has been devastated by the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, with workers across the nation losing their jobs and livelihood due to forced business closures. The NRAEF created the fund to help those struggling workers, with 100 percent of the monies raised going to impacted restaurant workers.“We are thrilled and inspired by TikTok’s commitment to help restaurant employees throughout the industry and across the country impacted by the COVID-19 crisis,\" said Rob Gifford, president of the NRAEF. \"Thanks to their substantial donation we will have the ability to help thousands of people who are out of work and facing financial hardship.\" For the full story on how RERF was established by the NRAEF, check out Gifford’s longform blog post on LinkedIn.This is an extraordinarily challenging time for everyone, and the restaurant industry will undoubtedly look very different after this unprecedented experience. Serving the communities most impacted by the coronavirus crisis is of utmost importance to us during this time, and this donation is only one of the many ways we are supporting vulnerable communities. Restaurant employees are essential to the survival of the industry and we stand in solidarity with them as we all anxiously wait for this moment in time to pass.

Marc and Heidi D'Amelio here. You likely know our daughters, Dixie and Charli from TikTok. Over the past seven months, we have witnessed our girls go from dancing in their rooms to dancing on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. We have seen both our daughters go from typical school girls to reaching millions of you on TikTok. It happened because they were being themselves, doing something fun that they loved that was authentic and people liked seeing their enthusiasm and creativity.As parents, there's nothing better than seeing your children doing something that makes them happy - and being successful at it. Watching our girls create content that resonates with people across the world has been amazing. We also realize that what happened with our teens is unusual, but the concerns we have as parents are the same as all of yours. We know that there is a flipside to the creative expression that our kids engage with on social media. We all know that the internet can be an unforgiving place, especially for teens. Every parent wants their children to pursue their passions, but at the end of the day, the most important thing is to teach them how to be safe so they are equipped to make good decisions. And that we as parents understand what our children are doing.That’s why we are pleased to learn that TikTok is continuing to take concrete actions to prioritize safety for all of us: users and creators alike. We encourage every parent to learn about their age-based features, code of conduct outlined in the Community Guidelines, and access the tools and controls that are available both in app, and on the TikTok website. The fact is that platforms like TikTok are going to play a big part in our kids’ lives and ours too.Family Pairing will allow parents/guardians to access the safety and privacy settings of their children's TikTok account and set controls for Direct Message access, Screen Time Management, and Restricted Mode.We hope that TikTok continues building these types of tools and controls – and that across the internet we see more companies provide thoughtful resources for families. At the end of the day we want to say, parents we are all in this together and we hope you take this opportunity with us to continue to educate ourselves on internet safety."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/taking-center-stage-supporting-performing-arts-through-the-actors-fund","date":"2020-04-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Taking center stage: Supporting performing arts through The Actors Fund","text":"The performing arts have a unique power to inspire and entertain us – and now more than ever, when we can't go to a concert or attend live theater, that entertainment is coming to life on TikTok.

These funds will enable The Actors Fund to provide critical financial assistance to those in the entertainment and performing arts with immediate need. \"We are grateful to TikTok for this generous donation to support The Actors Fund's COVID-19 emergency financial assistance,\" said Actors Fund Chairman Brian Stokes Mitchell. \"These funds will help thousands across the country impacted by work stoppage in the performing arts and entertainment community​: actors, camera people, writers, directors, musicians, dancers, crew members, editors and so many more people who lift us up and brighten our days through their work.

That was, of course, happening before COVID-19, but it has only accelerated since the outbreak began and social distancing brought families closer together. The embrace of platforms like ours is providing families with joint tools to express their creativity, share their stories, and show support for their communities. At the same time, they are often learning to navigate the digital landscape together and focused on ensuring a safe experience.With families in mind we've taken a number of steps over the past year to improve and enhance our teams, policies, controls, and educational resources. We've made our policies more transparent and accessible, grown our trust and safety teams, built upon the resources in our Safety Center, and partnered with leading online safety organizations including the Family Online Safety Institute, ConnectSafely, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the PTA.Today, we are advancing our commitment to building for the safety of our users by introducing Family Pairing, which allows parents and teens to customize their safety settings based on individual needs. Family Pairing enhances our suite of safety tools and complements our work to provide greater access to product features as users reach key milestones for digital literacy. It is part of our continued work toward providing parents better ability to guide their teen's online experience while allowing time to educate about online safety and digital citizenship.Many users start their creator journey at 13 and are introduced to a wider array of app options for download, making it a critical time for teens and their families to learn about digital literacy and smart online behavior. In addition to Family Pairing, TikTok already offers a number of resources to support users on this journey, including educational safety videos and parental guides like our Top Ten Tips for Parents. We also encourage parents to talk with their teens about the code of conduct outlined in our Community Guidelines to help them understand what responsible community behavior looks like, how to identify and report content that may be in violation, and what it means to be positive digital community members.Family Pairing, which will be rolling out over the coming weeks, will allow a parent to link their TikTok account to their teen's and set controls including:Screen Time Management: Control how long your teen can spend on TikTok each day. In addition, TikTok has partnered with top creators to make short videos that appear right in the app and encourage users to keep tabs on their screen time. These fun videos use the upbeat tone our users love while offering a suggestion to take a break and do something offline, like read a book.Restricted Mode: Limit the appearance of content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. Even without Family Pairing enabled, parents can help their teen set Screen Time Management and Restricted Mode by visiting the app's Digital Wellbeing controls at any time.Direct Messages: Restrict who can send messages to the connected account, or turn off direct messaging completely. With user safety in mind, we have many policies and controls in place for messaging already – for example, only approved followers can message each other, and we don't allow images or videos to be sent in messages. Starting April 30, we will be taking those protections one step further as relates to younger members of our community, and automatically disabling Direct Messages for registered accounts under the age of 16.We are committed to giving parents insight into, and control over, how their teens use TikTok and helping facilitate important conversations within families about the responsible navigation of digital platforms. We believe these options promote a safer and more trustworthy experience for our users of all ages, but our progress in this area is also never finished. We look forward to working with all our stakeholders as we continuously seek to improve through new features and resources to help our community manage their digital experience. From our partners“As a dad of two teens, I see how TikTok enables them to express their thoughts, feelings and creativity; have fun; and connect with their friends, especially in our current environment.

We understand the importance of continuing educational success for students who are physically away from the classroom and we have been inspired to see students and teachers connecting over humor on TikTok. As part of our larger global efforts to give back to our communities amidst the coronavirus, TikTok is partnering with National PTA to donate $2M to help fund critical K-12 programs that support distance learning as well as school meal benefits. The funds will equip PTAs with resources to help meet critical needs of students, families, teachers and communities during these times.“National PTA is grateful to be named as a beneficiary of TikTok’s Community Relief Fund. This donation will help us further support and advocate for families, schools and communities across the country and help them navigate the many challenges that have arisen from COVID-19,” said Leslie Boggs, president of National PTA. “Now more than ever, PTAs nationwide are working hard to ensure our families and school communities are safe, healthy and have what they need—focusing right now on social and emotional wellbeing, resources for distance teaching and learning, bridging the digital divide and access to school meal benefits. Because of TikTok’s generous support, PTA will be able to dramatically step up our efforts in all of these critical areas.” We are so grateful to our educators who work each day on our behalf and it fills our hearts with joy to contribute to important efforts on behalf of the students, teachers, and families rely on TikTok to connect with their communities.

Whether they're narrating a story, adding their own voice to a song, or simply describing what's seen on camera, creators can use this new feature in countless ways to help make engaging content. Adding a voiceover adds a new dimension to content, as seen in this video by @ghosthoney.

These users are total pros at going live on TikTok and answered countless questions while showcasing what makes them unique and a top TikTok creator. Whether it was enjoying TikTaco's with the D'Amelios, putting on makeup with Adam, Jackie, and Loren, or getting ready for bed with Chriselle, each creator helped the community relax and chill out during a typically stressful time. As hump day hit, TikTok users were treated to an evening of impressive talents and entertainment.

Zach King took the screen to do some live magic and even taught uses a trick they could do themselves. Brittany Tomlinson lightened to mood with some celebrity impersonations and Tracee Ellis Ross sang an impromptu song about patatoes. The evening ended with a cooking class from Joshua Weissman where the chef taught the audience how to cook the perfect rib-eye steak in only 15 minutes. The evening was full of fun, entertaining guests who managed to teach us a new skill we can try ourselves during social distancing. Thursday brought EduTok, an evening filled with some of TikTok's creative and informative educators that included Jessica Alba, Isabella Avila, Dr. Phil, Bill Nye, Ashley Hupp, Matthew Hussey, and Phil Cook. Alba gave a talk on entrepreneurship and knowing when to \"turn your side hustle into your main hustle.\" It was night filled with intriguing information on topics like entrepreneurship, psychology, science, positivity, and even dating during social distancing. Each creator brough expertise on a unique topic and helped to educate the community on something important to them.We closed out the week with \"Sound Check,\" TikTok's virtual music festival. The nights lineup featured Alicia Keys, Jason Derulo, Megan Three Stallion, Hailee Steinfeld, Troye Sivan, Meghan Trainor, Lauv, Yungblud, Kelsea Ballerini.

Other highlights include a behind the scenes look at songwriting, a new puppy, and a makeup session featuring Daryl Sabara. The first week of TikTok's #HappyAtHome: Live brought families and users together during a struggling time when the stress of daily life can make it hard to take a break and relax. Science, music, and more!The second week of #HappyAtHome: LIVE! put a spotlight on individual artists each night of the week. On Monday, rapper Blueface invited users to a virtual party where he answered fan questions, showed off his souped-up car, and even did some man-on-the-street impromptu interviewing and songwriting with a stranger. Nick Uhas took center screen on Tuesday to give viewers an action-packed 30 minutes with fun, safe science experiments and demonstrations from his very own backyard. He closed his show by calling for helpful donations when possible saying, “Follow the hashtag #HappyAtHome and share the link to donate to the World Health Organization.”Ashley Tisdale turned to the comments section to guide her Wednesday livestream and delivered on all of the top requests. She gave her viewers some much needed words of wisdom, performed some of her favorite songs, answered live fan questions, and took live fan requests - including singing her High School Musical hit song “Fabulous“ for the first time since she filmed the movie! On Thursday, Marshmallow unveiled his real voice to speak with users spending their social distancing time watching his livestream. During this unprecedented show, he showed users his process and tools for creating music, answered fan questions, and mixed music live.

Using her trusty drawing generator as a starting point, Audrey's fans decided she should draw a monster in a beauty pageant.

She was even nice enough to make her monster's dress \"extra poofy for social distancing.\"On Tuesday, Demi Bagby walked her live viewers through an indoor workout they could do at home while social distancing. This full body burn didn't require any weights so everyone could follow along regardless of the equipment they had. She also took questions and gave some tips to stay motivated. Drake Bell got us through hump day with a one hour and 45 minute acoustic concert live from the tiki room in his house. He played his own hits and took live requests to cover some of his fans’ other favorite songs that included the Friends theme song and Hard Day’s Night by The Beatles. He even gave his live audience a step-by-step tutorial on how to play the Drake and Josh Theme song “I Found A Way” so his guitarist viewers could play along from home! This was Drake's first live stream on TikTok but it definitely won't be his last. Justin Willman made Thursday night miraculous by giving viewers at home a live magic show he titled \"Magic from Home.\" The \"Magic for Humans\" star wowed and amazed his audience with classic, hilarious tricks and even taught them how to perform some fun magic tricks of their own. Justin gave users a sneek peak at the third season of \"Magic for Humans\" and reminded everyone to try and live in the moment even during these unusual times. We closed out the week with an amazing DJ set by Tory Lanez AKA \"DJ Corona-Free Tory.\" Tory exclusively played classic 2000s hits during his set but eventually opened it up to requests and fan questions. It was a night filled with good tunes, dance moves, and positive vibes and the perfect way to kick off the weekend."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-commitment-to-covid-19-relief-efforts","date":"2020-04-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Our commitment to COVID-19 relief efforts","text":"We're pledging $250M to support front line medical workers, educators, and local communities deeply affected by the global crisisFurther commitments include $25M in ads to help trusted organizations deliver crucial public health information and $100M in ad credits as businesses look to rebuildTikTok was created to bring joy and inspiration to our community. That idea has come to life through the playfulness of our creators who've brought dance challenges, funny performances, creative memes, and delightfully unique moments. It's been largely about having fun.COVID-19 is giving all of us a new perspective, and in the face of this unprecedented crisis, we are collectively seeking moments of joy and inspiration. Sometimes that means dancing and having fun where we can. Sometimes that means experiencing the comfort and warmth that comes through simple human connection in the face of adversity. The TikTok community is uplifting one another, caring for one another, and lending a hand to one another. This may be a serious time, but on TikTok it can still be joyful – and deeply inspiring. We are committed to playing our part in that global outpouring of mutual support and giving. We want to magnify all we are seeing across our community and translate it into concrete relief for those most affected by this crisis. Among the efforts TikTok will be supporting with cash contributions are:TikTok Health Heroes Relief Fund: Health care workers are the heroes of this global battle, and deserving heroes within the TikTok community. We are passionate about our small role in supporting their efforts through the provision of $150M in funds toward medical staffing, supplies, and hardship relief for health care workers. These distributions will be focused on local organizations to support local health workers. For example, we're partnering with the CDC Foundation to donate $15M toward supporting surge staffing for local response efforts through state and local health departments. We're also looking to assist global health workers, including our $10M contribution to the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. Our employee matching program will deliver aid to organizations including Direct Relief and the Red Cross. And we are working with global and local partners to distribute masks and other personal protective equipment to hospitals across India, Indonesia, Italy, South Korea, and the US, among other hard-hit countries. TikTok Community Relief Fund: We are all operating in uncertain times, and vulnerable communities have been deeply impacted by the health and economic damage caused by this crisis. To provide critical relief to these communities, TikTok will allot $40M in cash to local organizations that serve groups representative of TikTok's diverse user communities, including musicians, artists, nurses, educators, and families that have come together on our platform. And since we’re all in this together, we will be further matching $10M in donations from our community to support the community. Through this fund we're supporting programs like After-School All-Stars, where we have already donated $3M to provide food for families who rely upon school lunch programs affected by school closures across the US, and $2M to MusiCares to support artists, songwriters, and music professionals whose livelihoods have been severely impacted as a result of cancelled performance and gig work.TikTok Creative Learning Fund: With tens of millions of students around the world out of school, educators and parents need help facilitating ongoing learning from a distance. The same is true for the millions of creative professionals, from nonprofits like museums to those in the wellness industry, who were suddenly forced to find new ways to connect with people who depend on their services. Creative educational content on platforms like TikTok can help, and we will be providing $50M in grants to educators, professional experts, and nonprofits whose real-world skills and expertise can help spread educational information and useful course material in an accessible, distance learning format.We are also supporting our community through initiatives that include: Helping SMBs restart and rebuild: As economies largely cease activity to encourage social distancing and protect public health, small and medium-sized businesses, which are key to community employment, are uniquely at risk. We are committed to helping SMBs weather this crisis, and we will be providing $100M in ad credits to help companies get back on their feet once economies are able to restart normal activity. The program will begin rolling out to markets in the coming months, depending upon the decisions of public health authorities around the world regarding when and how to restart business operations. Contributing to public education efforts: Around the world, health authorities are working to inform the public as quickly as possible on a range of issues, including the importance of social distancing or proper hygiene. To facilitate that education, we are providing $25M in prominent in-feed ad space for NGOs, trusted health sources, and local authorities, enabling them to share important messages with millions of people and meaningfully engage the TikTok community. We've also hosted educational livestreams from representatives of the WHO, IFRC, and popular voices for public health and science, like Bill Nye the Science Guy. In addition, we've created a range of in-app resources, educational livestreams, educational hashtag challenges, and more which can be found on the COVID-19 Resources Page on our Safety Center.Supporting the emotional well-being of our community: Suffice it to say we're all feeling the impact of this global crisis, and the uncertainty, fear, and stress can take a toll on our emotional well-being. Cherished patterns of life are being disrupted; in-person contact with friends, family, colleagues, and communities has been altered or ceased altogether; and we're united in our concern for loved ones who are working hard on the front lines of the global health battle. There is no easy way to overcome the hurt this causes, but we are intent on supporting our inspired users who are already producing imaginative and joyful content to unite and provide comfort through efforts like #HappyAtHome, a theme helping our community engage their minds, lift their spirits, and make the time at home feel just a little less daunting. Looking ahead, TikTok will be actively seeking more ways to contribute, including identifying the most effective ways to allocate these remaining funds to support ongoing relief needs. We understand that these are challenging times for everyone. Alongside businesses, governments, NGOs, and ordinary people across the globe stepping up in this critical moment, we are committed to offering the very best that we can to help out humanity. Together, we will persevere through this time of crisis and emerge a better community and part of a world that we fervently hope will be more united in common purpose than it was before."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-supports-artists-and-musicares","date":"2020-04-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Helping the artists who bring us so much joy","text":"By Corey Sheridan, Head of Music Partnerships and Content Operations, TikTok USDuring this time of social distancing, there are few things that are able to connect us in the same way that music does. Whether you’re dancing through your days at home to the beat of your favorite tunes or you’re tuning into livestream performances from artists around the world to keep your spirits up, there is no denying that music has the power to connect people. Music and memes are the magical combination that keep us all captivated. And both are at the core of TikTok. From the inaugural Sound Check Friday living room concerts and conversations that capped off the first week of #HappyAtHome and subsequent livestream events, top artists have been connecting with their fans on a deeply authentic level through TikTok, opening the window to their artistic process or singing acapella to bring joy to people during these uncertain times. We’re continually amazed by the way stars use TikTok to engage with their fans, and also by the way fans help up-and-coming stars rise to the top. Alicia Keys hosted a Friday night concert at home, Jason Derulo, Troye Sivan and Meghan Trainor went live to hundreds of thousands of viewers. Megan Thee Stallion did her own version of the popular #Savagechallenge that has propelled her song to the charts. Marshmello shared his real voice with fans while teaching us how he mixes a track. Justin Beiber has encouraged fans to keep grooving while teaching us the choreography he's creating to his latest releases. And countless other artists have taken to TikTok to chat with their fans, spread some joy in the community, and give us all a glimpse of life as a star. We are so inspired seeing artists like everybody’s favorite, Dolly Parton, spread the message of her Imagination Library to our community, and stars like Robyn and Sir Elton John joining TikTok while staying home, but we’re equally inspired by the up and coming artists and songs that have shot to fame because of skyrocketing on our platform first. Creators like Curtis Roach, who went viral with \"Bored in the House,\" produced an lo-fi earworm using simply his floor boards and fingers for percussion, leading the emerging artist to a collaboration with Tyga that developed his comedic short hook into a full song. Or take one of the recent meme-worthy songs like The Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" that have inspired cardio-while-quarantined family dances that span generations, and are keeping our #healthheroes entertained during this challenging time. All of these moments make people laugh and give families a much-needed moment of levity.At TikTok, creativity is our heartbeat. And music is often part of many forms of self-expression that we see on TikTok; often in the background of hilarious moments, cinematic storylines, and for dropping like it's hot. We know that musicians, artists, and those working in the industry have seen countless gigs canceled because of this pandemic. And we want to help support the community that keeps us entertained. Today we donated $2M to MusiCares®, an organization supporting artists, songwriters, technicians, crew, and other music professionals whose livelihoods have been severely impacted as a result of cancelled performances and work. While we know this won't replace being on tour, we hope it can help working artists and music industry professionals through this challenging time. Supporting artists and helping the community fight COVID-19 has been a key focus for us. We’ve made donations to charitable organizations that are near and dear to the hearts of the TikTok community and we’ve helped celebrities use the platform to elevate their voices for good. Over the past few weeks, artists have also been using their songs to help educate the community on the steps we all need to take to combat COVID-19. Dillon Francis started #PassTheSoap, set to his song \"You Do You,\" while Gloria Gaynor used \"I Will Survive\" as a platform to encourage users to wash their hands. We’re thrilled to be able to support the work of MusiCares® through today’s donation. We're thankful for all of the artists and entertainers who rely on TikTok to connect with their fans, and like their fans, we can’t wait until we can see them not from a social distance but live on stage again. But until then, we're so very happy to connect you with them in your home."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-activities-to-do-in-the-house","date":"2020-03-31T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok activities to do in your home","text":"With social distancing keeping most people in their homes, it's easy to get bored during this stressful time.

Being asked to stay home can be unnerving, especially when there's so much uncertainty. We feel it, too. But one thing that has really moved our team is seeing the TikTok community unite around the things that show we're more alike now than ever before. We're all adjusting to new normals: coping with boredom, processing our uneasiness, and adjusting our daily habits. At its core that's what TikTok is all about: bringing people together. We couldn't be more inspired by the strong show of compassion and solidarity across the TikTok community.To honor that spirit, we've partnered with a wide range of amazing celebrities and creators to launch something special: #HappyAtHome: LIVE!, a week of nightly programming that kicks off today at 5:00 PM PDT and will run each evening through Friday. The goal is simple: share in a bit of levity, provide some comfort, and embrace the responsibility we all have to do the right thing by staying inside and stopping the spread. There's a lot we can't do right now, but this is one small way we can all help each other during these trying times. We're excited to be able to bring together a group of such talented people to livestream with us this week. We invite our community to kick back, relax, and check out some of the LIVE! experiences we have planned for this week: Motivation Monday: We're kicking off the week with inspirational talks, workouts, dance classes, and cooking tips featuring Tyra Banks, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Derek Hough, tWitch & Allison Holker, and Eitan Bernath.Kick Back Tuesday: Join some of TikTok's most popular creators for game night, makeup tutorials, and chat sessions with the likes of Loren Gray, Charli D'Amelio, Adam Ray, and Addison Rae.Show & Tell Wednesday: Hear from Dear Evan Hansen star Jordan Fisher, step into magic tricks with Zach King, keep it real with iconic actress and entrepreneur Tracee Ellis Ross, and much more from TikTok's diverse community of creators.EduTok Thursday: We're teaming up with the likes of Dr. Phil and Bill Nye for thoughtful conversations, advice, and life tips you don't want to miss.

But this is just one of the ways we’re trying to help.

This humanity transcends borders and backgrounds, and we're moved by how people are sharing their strength when we need it most. Most importantly, it's been gratifying to see the global community rally behind the true heroes of this crisis: the health care professionals around the world who are battling on behalf of us all. There are no words to express the debt we all owe those who are putting their personal safety at risk, who are voluntarily separating themselves from their own families, who are working around the clock and under incredibly challenging circumstances to save lives. We believe it's essential to do everything we can to help the global health community in this fight, and today TikTok is donating $10 million to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Solidarity Response Fund. This fund helps the WHO carry out vitally important work, including sending essential supplies to front line health care workers, ensuring communities have access to the latest science-based information, and accelerating efforts to discover life-saving treatments or vaccines. Alongside many great companies and individuals, we're passionate about doing our small part to contribute to this important cause and the critical work the fund enables.This is another step in our drive to support the global health field and the pandemic's impact on local communities. We continue to donate critical supplies to countries and communities in need, including helping procure masks for health care workers and enabling the distribution of food support for students, teachers, and families affected by school closures. We're matching employee donations to a range of local and global initiatives, including WHO, Red Cross, and a number of direct relief programs. As a company we continue to seek out ways to get involved and lend a hand.“We can only stop this virus with a coordinated, global response, where everyone – from every sector – is doing their part. TikTok’s extraordinarily generous contribution to the World Health Organization’s global effort is a perfect example of that. Now is the time for all individuals and companies to come together and fight this virus – because the case for cooperation simply couldn’t be clearer.”– Elizabeth Cousens, President & CEO of the UN FoundationCognizant of the power of TikTok's global reach, we're also focused on using our platform to support the World Health Organization's efforts to keep the global community informed and healthy:We've hosted a number of livestreams with WHO experts, with users in over 70 countries tuning in for trusted information and live Q&AWe've partnered with WHO to create an informational page on TikTok that offers tips on staying safe and preventing the spread of the virus, and dispels myths around COVID-19We have labels on coronavirus-related videos which point users to trusted information, with resources directly in the app as well as in the dedicated COVID-19 section of our Safety CenterAs this fight continues, we will continue to identify ways to help health care workers and our local communities. We encourage anyone financially able to join us in donating to the Solidarity Response Fund in this crucial time.In the meantime, one thing every single person can do to help our health care heroes is to reduce our own risk of infection. Please, listen to and abide by the guidance being offered by your local government. If you’ve been advised to shelter in place, or to avoid crowds, do so. Maintain hygiene as rigorously as you possibly can. And take care of one another so that our health care workers can focus on taking care of those who need help the most."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/adorable-videos-of-kittens-to-brighten-your-day","date":"2020-03-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Adorable videos of kittens to brighten your day","text":"Life is undergoing a lot of significant changes with the current rise of COVID-19.

Millions of students, teachers and families depend on school resources for more than learning. The reality of this struck a nerve for the TikTok family, with many parents on our team and countless students, parents, families, and teachers in our community. As a company, we are committed to helping the broader TikTok family navigate through this extraordinarily difficult time. We are all operating in uncertain times, and it’s more important now than ever before, for both our local and global communities to come together to help those in need. Today we are donating $3M through a partnership with After-School All-Stars (ASAS) to help provide food for families who have been impacted by the loss of access to free or reduced-cost school meals. ASAS, an organization founded by former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that provides school-based, free, comprehensive after-school programs, is currently supporting 100,000 families year-round across 13 different states. Our donation will aid in the distribution of food credits and gift cards for local grocery partners, providing critical support for families in 60 cities across the U.S., including Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Newark, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington D.C., and more. These resources will help communities that have been hit the hardest by the residual impact of the coronavirus pandemic. And while this alone won’t mitigate the impact of the current situation, we hope it can relieve one worry for parents who are balancing social distancing mandates, work and caring for children who can no longer go to school each day. In addition, TikTok will also match up to $1M in employee donations to ASAS to further the organization's ability to provide food for those in need.\"While our After-School All-Stars programs are paused with schools closed, we take our responsibility to serve the 100,000 families we work with year-round to provide a safe place for their children to learn and grow after-school seriously. When I founded After-School All-Stars in 1992, the goal was always to support the families who need us the most. I want to thank my friends at TikTok for their donation, because it will allow us to pivot to use our After-School All-Stars team to deliver groceries and gift cards for groceries to the families we help.\" – Arnold Schwarzenegger, Former Gov. California and Founder of After-School All-Stars We will also continue to use our platform to facilitate other partnerships that will benefit families across the country and around the world.

Our diverse, expressive community makes spending time on TikTok feel lighthearted, real, heartwarming, and truly fun. TikTok is a place where everyone's creative side is welcome. As a company, we're motivated by a deep sense of responsibility to this community – the backbone of our platform – just as we're driven to build a product deserving of their creativity. This is summed up in our mission: to inspire creativity and bring joy.Mindful of our responsibility to our users, last year we shared our intention to form an external council of leading experts to advise TikTok on content moderation policies covering a wide range of topics. We've made great progress as a company since we took the first steps of partnering with global law firm K&L Gates LLP and their team, including former Congressmen Bart Gordon and Jeff Denham. Earlier this year we updated our Community Guidelines to provide clarity to our users, and last week we announced our Transparency Center that will provide content and coding insight to outside experts. Today, we're pleased to introduce the important gathering of technology and safety experts who will help shape our policies as the founding members of TikTok's Content Advisory Council. This Council brings together thought leaders who can help us develop forward-looking policies that not only address the challenges of today, but also plan ahead for the next set of issues that our industry will face.Commenting on the TikTok initiative, former Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) said: \"We are proud of the work TikTok's US leadership has put in, alongside our team, to form a group of experts with a diverse array of experiences and perspectives.\"In praise of the initial group of experts, former Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) stated: \"We firmly believe that this Council is more than capable of providing candid and productive advice as TikTok continues to strengthen its content moderation policies.\"The Council members we've assembled represent a diverse array of backgrounds and perspectives, and spent much of their lives researching, studying and analyzing issues relevant to TikTok and the space we operate in, such as child safety, hate speech, misinformation, and bullying. We will call upon our Council to provide unvarnished views on and advice around TikTok’s policies and practices as we continually work to improve in the challenging area of content moderation. That’s why we're excited to have members who represent legal, regulatory, and academic expertise, as well as the needs and perspectives of our diverse community.The initial Council members draw from the technology, policy, and health and wellness industries and will be led by Dawn Nunziato as chair. A professor at George Washington University Law School and co-director of the Global Internet Freedom Project, Dawn specializes in issues involving free speech and content regulation, and brings a wealth of knowledge to help steer the Council on the key issues affecting both TikTok and the broader technology landscape. In joining the TikTok Advisory Council, Dawn Nunziato, George Washington University Law School, said: \"A company willing to open its doors to outside experts to help shape upcoming policy shows organizational maturity and humility. I am working with TikTok because they've shown that they take content moderation seriously, are open to feedback, and understand the importance of this area both for their community and for the future of healthy public discourse.We look forward to surrounding ourselves with industry leaders in their fields as we continue to strengthen our content moderation policies and platform practices, and we are grateful for their advice and contribution to making TikTok a place where joy and creativity can thrive. Filling out the initial members of TikTok's Content Advisory Council, which will grow to a group of around a dozen experts, are:Rob Atkinson, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, brings academic, private sector, and government experience as well as knowledge of technology policy that can advise our approach to innovationHany Farid, University of California, Berkeley Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences and School of Information, is a renowned expert on digital image and video forensics, computer vision, deep fakes, and robust hashingMary Anne Franks, University of Miami Law School, focuses on the intersection of law and technology and will provide valuable insight into industry challenges including discrimination, safety, and online identityVicki Harrison, Stanford Psychiatry Center for Youth Mental Health and Wellbeing, is a social worker at the intersection of social media and mental health who understands child safety issues and holistic youth needsDawn Nunziato, chair, George Washington University Law School, is an internationally recognized expert in free speech and content regulationDavid Ryan Polgar, All Tech Is Human, is a leading voice in tech ethics, digital citizenship, and navigating the complex challenge of aligning societal interests with technological prioritiesDan Schnur, USC Annenberg Center on Communication and UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, brings valuable experience and insight on political communications and voter informationThe Council will meet alongside our US leaders to discuss areas of importance to the company and our users, with our first Content Advisory Council meeting at the end of this month focusing on critical topics around platform integrity, including policies against misinformation and election interference. Ensuring integrity and promoting authenticity around civic engagement are important challenges for content platforms, and we are cognizant of the need to build responsibly in this area. In addition to the many protections we've already enacted – including banning political ads, working to detect and remove deepfakes, enabling users to report misleading information, and partnering with third-party fact-checking and media literacy organizations – we want to surround ourselves with experts who can both evaluate the actions we've taken and provide guidance on additional measures we could be pursuing. All of our actions, including the creation of this Council, help advance our focus on creating an entertaining, genuine experience for our community by staying true to why users uniquely love the TikTok platform. As our company grows, we are focused on reflection and learning as a part of company culture and committed to transparently sharing our progress with our users and stakeholders. Our hope is that through thought-provoking conversations and candid feedback, we will find productive ways to support platform integrity, counter potential misuse, and protect the interests of all those who use our platform."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/who-to-livestream-on-tiktok","date":"2020-03-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"WHO to livestream on TikTok","text":"At TikTok we're focused on supporting our users by providing accurate information and resources from public health officials, as well as continued support, encouragement, and uplifting videos that our community share with each other during this challenging time. To that end, we've partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) to create an informational page on TikTok that provides trustworthy information, offers tips on staying safe and preventing the spread of the virus, and dispels myths around COVID-19. Beyond the library of information WHO offers users on our in-app landing page, it also serves as a valuable resource for our community by using its TikTok account to create videos that provide users critical and informed medical information and tips.On March 17th, the WHO will be livestreaming to our global community from their official TikTok page to share up-to-date information on what the steps users can take at this time, as well as answer questions you might have.To tune in with the World Health Organization live on TikTok, visit @WHO on March 17th at 12pm GMT. For more from WHO, visit their website. To learn more about TikTok's effort to support and educate our community through COVID-19, check out our COVID-19 resources page on our Safety Center.UPDATE: Due to the overwhelming response, the World Health Organization will be hosting an additional livestream on Thursday, March 19th at 1pm GMT from their account, @WHO.In Case You Missed It—Things We Learned from the WHO's Livestreams on TikTok:In the World Health Organization's first livestreams on TikTok, experts from the organization shared important information on novel coronavirus. In the first stream Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on the outbreak, detailed what the virus was and provided guidance on safety practices. The second livestream featured Lindsay Lee, the WHO's Technical Officer on disability, discussing how people with disabilities can stay safe during this time.Here are some highlights from the conversations:Understanding COVID-19COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that was discovered in November 2019. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that mainly come from animals, with some of these coronavirus will spill over into human populations.COVID-19 is a virus that causes respiratory disease in the people it infects and spreads through two manners: (1) via tiny droplets of liquid that come out from your mouth or nose when you cough, sneeze or speak and (2) via fomites, which are inanimate objects, such as counters and tabletop surfaces, that can become contaminated with infected droplets, which can then spread the disease when people touch them and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.Preventing the spread by practicing safe behaviorOne of the major ways to reduce the spread of coronavirus is frequent, thorough hand-washing, as soap and water kill the virus. Dr. Kerkhove recommends using an alcohol-based rubs if you don't have access to soap and water.Avoid touching your face, eyes, nose, and mouth.Another major safety precaution people can take is to stay home and avoid congregating with people. However, if you feel sick and are having trouble breathing, please contact your doctor and seek treatment.Navigating a pandemicFollow the guidance of national authorities on whether you should shelter in place. If you're recommended to stay home, then do so, but still follow the same fundamental rules of washing your hands, refraining from touching your face, and practicing respiratory etiquette by staying away from other people.It's safe to order online and receive packages, as the virus doesn't last on surfaces for very long, and parcels can be cleaned through disinfectants. You don't need to disinfect groceries, but you should wash produce and then wash your hands afterwards. Yes, you may still play with your pets :)Recognizing our differencesPeople who are most vulnerable for developing severe disease are those older than 60 as well as people with disabilities, including those who have underlying conditions like chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The WHO estimates that 15% of world's population experience some disability. And those that are disabled face unique challenges because they may experience barriers to implementing the basic hygiene measures and might be at a higher risk of developing a more severe case of coronavirus.However, there are measures that people with disabilities can adopt to stay safe during the pandemic, such as (i) enacting the basic hygiene measures the WHO has advised, (ii) developing plans to ensure they are able to obtain the supplies they need or contact those who are helping them, and (iii) communicating regularly with their support networks, irrespective of whether or not they are experiencing symptoms.Supporting those who may be more vulnerableThe number one thing people can do to support those with disabilities is to make sure they're following all of the basic protection measures the WHO is recommending (e.g. washing hands, staying home, keeping distance, not touching face). If everyone does this, they will be helping reduce the spread of the virus to those who are at a higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms of the virus.If you know of people in your community who might be at higher risk, check in with them and ask what you can do to help them— this will help them grow their support network and help assuage their anxieties.Business owners should make sure that their workplace is prepared for a COVID-19 outbreak.Healthcare workers providing care to those infected with coronavirus should make sure that they are doing so in ways that are accessible and inclusive. This means removing barriers to the facility (even financial barriers) and ensuring they are not treating patients differently because they have a disability.Both Dr. Kerkhove and Officer Lee noted that although there's a lot of fear and panic about coronavirus, these feelings are perfectly normal. These are the moments that give us the opportunity to turn our collective fear into action, giving us a real opportunity to support one another."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/the-cinematic-side-of-tiktok","date":"2020-03-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"The cinematic side of TikTok","text":"TikTok is home to videos of all styles that feature creators expressing themselves and some of these users have developed a talent for visual storytelling.

This new facility in our LA office will provide outside experts an opportunity to directly view how our teams at TikTok go about the day-to-day challenging, but critically important, work of moderating content on the platform.Through this direct observation of our Trust & Safety practices, experts will get a chance to evaluate our moderation systems, processes and policies in a holistic manner. That includes, but is not limited to, seeing:how our trained content moderators apply those Guidelines to review the technology-based actions that are escalated to them, and to identify additional potential violations that the technology may miss; how users and creators are able to bring concerns to our attention and how those are handled;ultimately, how the content that is allowed on the platform aligns with our Guidelines.We expect the Transparency Center to operate as a forum where observers will be able to provide meaningful feedback on our practices.

Today, we want to outline some of our protective measures in order to provide transparency on our practices and share our efforts to prevent and remove Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). This area is challenging but critically important for our industry, but TikTok has a zero tolerance policy for predatory or grooming behavior.PoliciesWe prohibit content that depicts or disseminates child abuse, child nudity, or sexual exploitation of children in digital or real world format. If we become aware of any such content, which is in direct violation of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, we will take immediate action to remove content, terminate accounts, and report cases to NCMEC and law enforcement as appropriate. Protecting against the threat of online child sexual exploitation and abuse is an issue that requires a global response, including collaboration between governments and industry, and the sharing of skills and resources to support a safe online environment. With this in mind, we're committed to promoting and supporting the implementation the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, adopted by Five Eyes alliance – a collaboration between intelligence agencies in the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. These Voluntary Principles outline a framework which can be consistently applied across sectors and services to respond to changing societal and offending behaviors and reduce risks for users. This is one of our many efforts to protect children both online and off.PeopleOur global safety teams comprise experienced industry professionals whose backgrounds span product, policy, compliance, child safety, law, privacy, and NGOs. Regional Trust & Safety hubs in California, Dublin, and Singapore oversee the development and execution of moderation policies and work to localize in each market. The hubs are focused on strengthening policies, technologies, and moderation strategies and ensuring that they complement both local culture and context. Our Trust & Safety leaders collaborate closely with regional regulators, policymakers, government, and law enforcement agencies in our pursuit to promote the highest possible standard of user safety. PracticesWe employ human and machine-based moderation tools like photo identification technologies, in alignment with industry standards, to identify and remove exploitative content. In addition, we filter red-flag language and share information with NCMEC about situations that may indicate grooming behavior, according to their policies and industry norms.ProductTikTok is an app for users 13 and over, and along with an age-gate, we've given the app a 12+ App Store rating so that parents can enable device-level restrictions on their child's phone. In the US, we accommodate users under the age of 13 in a limited app experience that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for a younger audience, in line with industry practice for mixed audience apps of splitting users into age-appropriate environments.Unlike other platforms, we don't permit images or videos to be sent in comments or messages. This was a deliberate decision on our part: studies have shown that a proliferation of Child Sexual Abuse Material has been linked and spread via messaging. TikTok was built to provide a positive place for creativity and we prioritize the safety of our users. From the very beginning we chose not to allow users to upload photos or videos to their messages. At TikTok, we do not want bad actors in our ecosystem and neither do our users, which is why we encourage our community to report content or accounts that may be in violation or our guidelines.

We partnered with McCann Worldgroup, the world’s premier advertising agency, to roll out a global creative competition. Called Inspire with TikTok, the competition aimed to give McCann Worldgroup’s 20,000 employees across the world a chance to explore TikTok’s creative possibilities and uncover how the platform could help its thousands of clients engage with our unique content type and audience.Launched in late 2019, the competition allowed McCann teams one month to develop a TikTok Hashtag Challenge, a unique format on TikTok that allows users to create content under a hashtag, let content find its right audience, and gather users with shared interests into communities. The competition received almost 100 entries from countries across North America, Europe, Middle East, South America and Asia. The McCann teams' creatives were also encouraged to create a Branded Effect, another format on TikTok that enables advertisers to have deeper engagement with users via interactive and creative effects. Every entry should be designed to drive awareness for a brand or a product of one of McCann Worldgroup’s clients. The Grand Prize winner would have a chance to turn their idea into an official TikTok Branded Effect.The judging panel – drawn from senior TikTok and McCann Worldgroup staff around the world, as well as Cosette Rinab,@cutiejpp,@afshanrooh, TikTok's top creators from the US, Japan and India – was impressed by the entries as they evaluated the work against five criteria: storytelling, creative idea, visual design, brand relevance, and soundtrack.After reviewing countless amazing submissions, the judges selected the top three entries:In third place was #SongLanguage, a campaign entered by McCann Birmingham (UK) on behalf of a lollipop brand. The goal was to bring home the challenge of living with deafness. With more than half of people admitting to feeling uncomfortable communicating with someone who is deaf, the campaign aimed to teach people basic sign language by showing them every day phrases taken from music tracks.In second place was a Hashtag Challenge for a shoe brand, an entry from McCann’s team in Oslo (Norway). Using the tried and trusted jump cuts challenge, the idea gave users the chance to show their week’s footwear with a simple-to-use lens set to Craig David’s 7 Days. The challenge was a perfect way to showcase the brand’s wide range of budget footwear styles.The grand prize winner also came from McCann in Oslo, but this time on behalf of The Munch Museum in Oslo, which celebrates the works of Norway’s most famous artist. The new Museum will open in the summer of 2020. #MunchScream took as its inspiration Edvard Munch’s most famous piece – The Scream – and gives TikTok users the opportunity to turn their own screaming faces into an interpretation of the painting.The judges loved the winning idea and praised it for the “eye-catching idea” and as a “fun way to get people to connect personally with art.”Our team is now working closely with McCann in Oslo to turn the winning idea into a Branded Effect; watch out for #MunchScream challenge coming soon!Visit TikTok's site to find out more about Branded Effect and other creative ways to reach your audience with TikTok."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/mls-achieves-tiktok-goals","date":"2020-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"MLS achieves TikTok goals","text":"TikTok is a place for major league sports teams to connect with their fans and deliver behind the scenes content featuring teams, players, and the game they love. To celebrate the start of a new season, Major League Soccer - @MLS - is hopping in on the fun and joining the TikTok community just in time to kick off their 25th season.With exclusive footage, access to players, and a sneak peek into the most popular sport on earth, the MLS and its clubs like the LA Galaxy and Chicago Fire are sure to deliver exciting new content to TikTok like a free kick delivered nicely into the upper 90 of a goal. The TikTok community can catch the start of the season on Saturday, February 29th and join in the fun with their own unique videos using #MLSisBack.#MLSisBack and we're ready...Just a few reasons to love soccer players Even cats love to play soccer Hold me closer tiny stealer Chicago Fire went oops"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/have-fun-be-smart-stay-safe","date":"2020-02-26T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"Have fun.

During the #MakeBlackHistory Summit, over 100 Black creators joined us in Los Angeles for two days of community building, inspiration, learning, and fun. The event featured performances by a top artist with a viral song on TikTok, discussions with celebrities and industry executives on the importance of cultural content creation, and working sessions focused on career development, personal branding, and more.It's always important to us to recognize, uplift and invest in those on our platform who are driving culture and creativity. Attendees of the summit included @shreksdumpster, whose vivid imagination always shines through her content, and @king.science, whose account is a testimony to the magic that happens when talent, creativity, and artistry collide. TikTok is proud to honor such an amazing group of creators who are contributing to community on the platform. Their stories help us understand how TikTok can continue to innovate and build products that have lasting impact. We believe that TikTok, at its best, creates opportunities for users to create content that resonates with others and helps them build a stronger community. We recognize that for many users TikTok allows them to showcase their creativity and reach new heights, and it's important to us that we are celebrating the diverse voices that exist on the platform.Building and supporting community is at the heart of everything we do at TikTok. At the kickoff dinner on Thursday evening, we welcomed the creators before businesswoman and entrepreneur Tyra Banks spoke to our guests about fostering an environment that encourages inclusivity allows users to feel comfortable creating, and ultimately sharing, their authentic selves.Iconic actress and entrepreneur, Tracee Ellis Ross was interviewed on stage by creator Drea Okeke aka @Dreaknowsbest. Tracee spoke to attendees about how she built her successful personal brand by being true to herself.“I've tried to be other people for so long, but I realized that I do me best.\" - Tracee Ellis Ross, before filming her very first TikTok: Another surprise speaker appeared at the summit - actor, musician, business executive, and television show host, Nick Cannon shared how hard work, coupled with adopting visualization exercises early in his career, allowed him to score roles on TV. Nick emphasized to the creators the importance that personal reflection can have in helping them reach their goals.\"Spend time with yourself, that's when your creativity really takes place.\" - Nick CannonA commitment to introspection and intentionality is also what propelled Tunji Balogun (Executive Vice President, A&R at RCA Records) and Robi Reed (Vice President of Talent and Casting, Original Programming at BET) to success. In a fireside chat moderated by Isabel Quinteros, who manages Music Partnerships & Artist Relations at TikTok, the two spoke to the creator audience about how to become the most successful version of themselves—something Tunji and Robi attribute to fueling their successful careers in the entertainment industry.\"Always be ready because you never know when your chance will come.\" - Robi Reed\"Never underestimate anyone, especially yourself.\" -Tunji BalogunIn the afternoon, the creators were treated to a discussion from their peers, @brycexavier and @mahoganylox, with entertainment and social media talent managers Gigi Harville and Christina Bachelor about how creators can achieve breakthrough success on TikTok. Bryce credits his success to determination and consistency. \"Along with doing content, it takes a lot of energy to focus and make sure the quality is there,\" he shared. Meanwhile, the managers stressed the importance of removing fear. Christina urged the attendees to \"take out the words I can't and put in the words I will try.\"At the end of the panels and sessions, a few creators got onstage and bravely shared their fears, their learnings, and their goals for the year ahead and received an overwhelming amount of warmth and encouragement from the other creators.The night opened with a gala dinner where actor, comedian, and activist Terry Crews gave a keynote speech imploring the audience to hold tight to their imagination.\"No one can replace your creativity, your creativity is you.\" - Terry CrewsThe gala ended with a a special private performance by artist Doja Cat, who sang her hit \"Say So\" as everyone in the room danced and cheered along to the song, which has become a viral trend on the platform. The #MakeBlackHistory Creator Summit was an amazing opportunity for us to support this thriving, talented community. Thank you to the guest speakers and performers for their enthusiasm and kindness, and for sharing their invaluable expertise. And a very special thank you to the Black creators who are inspiring joy and creativity on TikTok for everyone. We are honored to celebrate these individuals and look forward to continuing to grow with the community.Many thanks to the partners, @puma, @fentybeauty, and @beatsbydre who provided swag for the creators to wear throughout the weekend.

Today we want to provide an update on some of the recent steps we've taken toward these efforts.Growing our local presenceAs TikTok expands around the world, we're committed to building local teams that can help ensure our decisions and operations reflect the diverse communities we serve. Over the past year, we've grown to over 400 employees in the US who support and foster the app experience, and last month we moved into a new home in Los Angeles. The new space that reflects our creative, fun spirit and is large enough to house our talented, passionate, and growing team as we scale our local operations. We're also building out our team in places like New York City, San Francisco, Mountain View, and Austin.Expanding our expertise In conjunction with building our physical presence, we’ve made key hires to expand our expertise in vitally important areas. Some of our key US-based leadership hires in 2019 spanned functions including product, safety, content, music, sales, and operations. For example, our US-based safety team has grown considerably over the last year, including hiring a Head of Safety and a strong team of leaders in LA as we scale to better protect our users. Our Trust & Safety hub in the San Francisco Bay Area has also grown and now sits alongside similar hubs in Dublin and Singapore. Our global safety teams comprise experienced industry professionals whose backgrounds span product, policy, compliance, child safety, law, privacy, and NGOs. These dedicated hubs are focused on strengthening policies, technologies, and moderation strategies and ensuring that they complement both local culture and context. Our Trust & Safety leaders collaborate closely with regional regulators, policymakers, government, and law enforcement agencies in our pursuit to promote the highest possible standard of user safety. In just the past few weeks, we welcomed Erich Andersen, an IP policy, compliance and legal expert with 20 years of industry experience, as our Global General Counsel, and announced that Michael Beckerman, an experienced tech policy expert, will join us as Head of Government Relations and Policy. These hires add even more depth to our already phenomenal team, helping us continue to tackle the various and ever-evolving issues that TikTok and the entire industry face.Strengthening our youth safety effortsTikTok is an app with a broad reach and we care deeply about the safety of our users, particularly our younger teens. That’s why we recently teamed up with the Family Online Safety Institute and National Parent Teacher Association to launch initiatives aimed at educating families about safety on the app and guiding parents in having open, ongoing conversations with their teens. As part of the collaboration, we awarded 30 local PTAs from across the country with grants of $1,000 each to host family workshops on online safety at their school in conjunction with Safer Internet Day. We're committed to providing education to our own community as well, which we do in part through our safety video series, \"You're In Control\" – a series of videos designed with the user in mind that offers a fun, informative look at some of TikTok's safety features and best practices.Our youth safety efforts go deep into product and policy, too. Unlike other platforms, we don't permit images or videos to be sent in comments or messages. While this may seem unusual, it was a deliberate choice: studies have shown that a proliferation of child sexual abuse materials has been linked and spread via messaging. We've introduced several policy and product changes to protect younger users as well. In December, for example, we announced that we'd raised the minimum age for virtual gifting and now only allow those aged 18 and over to purchase, send, or receive virtual gifts. We continue to strengthen our internal controls and work with third parties in the internet youth protection space to better protect users.Building in line with our valuesA constant throughout this growth is our unwavering commitment to the integrity of the TikTok platform and the content it supports. Last year we released our first Transparency Report with clear information for each market to show how we balance cooperation with legal requests and protection of user rights. We recently introduced a comprehensive, expanded publication of the Community Guidelines that help maintain a supportive and welcoming environment on TikTok, giving users far more detail and clarity around how we define harmful or unsafe content that is not permitted on the platform. To keep ahead of evolving behavior and address industry-wide risks, we're working with third-party fact checking and media literacy organizations, such as the Poynter Institute and its MediaWise program, to counter potential misinformation. We've begun surfacing in-app notices around hashtags related to topical issues like coronavirus or election-related content to remind our users of our Community Guidelines, which make clear that we do not permit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public, including disinformation campaigns, manipulated content intended to cause harm, and content that misleads about elections or civic processes. We've also added more detailed reporting options, with reports of misleading information sent to a dedicated, highly-trained team of moderators based in our Los Angeles office that reviews the accounts and videos in accordance with our policies. As we've shared, we're working on a new initiative in combination with global law firm K&L Gates to further strengthen our teams, moderation policies, and overall transparency, including creating a committee of outside experts to advise on and review content moderation policies covering a wide range of topics, including child safety, hate speech, misinformation, bullying, and other potential issues.These are all continuing steps in a longer journey. Earning stakeholder trust requires us to be vigilant, make necessary investments and, above all, to listen and respond to feedback. We are committed to doing so. Ultimately, it is all part of fulfilling our mission of providing a welcoming space for all our users to express their creativity and find joyful, meaningful content."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-is-the-question-on-jeopardy","date":"2020-02-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok is the question on JEOPARDY!","text":"Last night, TikTok joined the ranks of historical figures, famous landmarks, and potpourri that have been honored with an answer on the classic game show \"Jeopardy!\" Deep in double jeopardy, beneath a $2000 sign, lay the answer \"This app that specializes in 15-second videos gets its name from the sound of a clock.\" The question, \"What is TikTok?\" was quickly given for easy money.

We're thrilled when this creativity brings joy, laughter, and inspiration to our community – and we place great importance on the measures we can take to support platform integrity so TikTok continues being a home where compelling, authentic content can thrive. In part, this means developing features and policies that promote the safety and well-being of our TikTok community.In this post, we want to highlight a few of the steps we've taken that empower our community to protect against the potential spread of misinformation.Maintaining integrityEarlier this year we added greater clarity to our Community Guidelines to detail how we define harmful or unsafe content that is not permitted on the platform. These guidelines support our vision for the platform and represent our core values – including our commitment to integrity and authenticity. To that end, we do not allow content intended to mislead our community, such as impersonation, spamming, phishing, or disinformation campaigns. We also do not permit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public, including content meant to incite fear, hate, or prejudice, and that which may harm an individual's health or wider public safety.Introducing new reporting optionsWe value our users' trust, and work hard to maintain that trust by removing content reported by our users that violates our Community Guidelines. We've also added more detailed reporting options to help our community flag things for us to review.If you come across a video you believe may contain intentionally deceptive information, you can report it by selecting the new \"misleading information\" category. If you notice an account that seems to post misleading information frequently, you can also now report the entire account for that reason. These reports will be sent to a dedicated, highly-trained team of moderators based in our Los Angeles office that reviews the accounts and videos in accordance with our policies on misleading information. To further aid our efforts, we are working with third-party fact-checking and media literacy organizations, such as the Poynter Institute and its MediaWise program. Supporting healthy community interactionsTikTok is an inclusive platform built upon the foundation of creative expression. We encourage users to celebrate what makes them unique, while finding a community that does the same. Hashtags are a popular way for our users to express themselves and connect with others around a shared topical interest, and we welcome the diverse conversations that emanate from our users' creative videos. As one of many approaches we take toward supporting a respectful environment, we will begin surfacing in-app notices on election-related hashtag pages to remind users of the importance of adhering to our Community Guidelines when creating, viewing, or interacting with content on the app. For example, our guidelines specifically prohibit misinformation that can cause harm or mislead the community about elections or other civic processes. Over time, we may expand or adjust the list of hashtags where we display this reminder.Tackling misinformation is just one of the ways we are committed to protecting the safety and integrity of the platform. We continue to work toward improving the app and user experience, and hope these tools around misinformation can help foster a welcoming space for all our users to express their creativity and find joyful, meaningful content."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-celebrates-artists-and-creators-at-the-grammy-awards","date":"2020-01-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok celebrates artists and creators at the Grammy Awards","text":"A year of exciting musical moments, mega hits, and breakout stars rising to fame on TikTok culminated last night with the Grammy Awards.

We're also committed to keeping this community safe.Today, we're releasing a comprehensive, expanded publication of the Community Guidelines that help maintain a supportive and welcoming environment on TikTok. These guidelines reflect our driving philosophy – providing a platform for creative self-expression while remaining safe, diverse, and authentic – and define a common code of conduct on our platform. We want to be sure users understand TikTok's guidelines, including when and why we place some restrictions on what is or isn't allowed on the app. Users will begin receiving notifications of the updated guidelines starting today, and can always refer to them on our Safety Center and directly in the app.Updated for greater transparencyThe Community Guidelines we've published today give users far more detail than previous versions. Over the past year our global trust and safety team has grown, just as our platform has, and we've combined our experience to bring greater transparency to our guidelines.Users will also notice we've grouped violations into 10 distinct categories, each of which includes an explanation of the rationale and several detailed bullet points to clarify what type of misbehavior would fall into that category.These changes offer clarity around how we define harmful or unsafe content that is not permitted on the platform. It’s important that users have insight into the philosophy behind our moderation decisions and the framework for making such judgements.The values behind our guidelinesWhile the language and structure of our Community Guidelines are new, the fundamental values that shape them remain unchanged.TikTok is an inclusive platform built upon the foundation of creative expression. We encourage users to celebrate what makes them unique, within a community that does the same. Our community is diverse and global, and we aim to cultivate an environment for authentic interactions. We believe that feeling safe helps users feel comfortable expressing themselves openly and allows creativity to flourish.Our global guidelines are the basis of the moderation policies TikTok's regional and country teams localize and implement in accordance with local laws and norms. Our teams remove content that violates these guidelines, and suspend or ban accounts involved in severe or repeated violations.Inspiring creativity and bringing joy to users across the globeAnother way to view our mission is this: spending time on TikTok is meant to be rewarding and fun. That doesn't mean serious or controversial content doesn't have a place on our platform; ultimately, the platform is built to support our users and their diverse thoughts, experiences, and interests.

This report provides important insight and clarity to our users regarding the volume and nature of governmental requests for our users' account information and other legal notifications.At TikTok, we are committed to enabling our users to create and have fun in a safe and supportive environment. We believe that when people feel safe, their creativity can flourish. That's why we want to be transparent about how we work appropriately with the legitimate requests of governments and law enforcement authorities. Like all global internet platforms, TikTok is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in each country. Occasionally we are presented with requests from various official bodies in the countries where the TikTok app operates, such as government agencies or law enforcement officials, asking us to take certain actions at their behest. These include requests to take down content deemed to be in violation of local laws, or to provide information related to accounts under certain defined circumstances, such as to assist in a criminal investigation or emergency request.We take such requests extremely seriously, and closely review each request that we receive to determine whether, for example, the request adheres to the required legal process or the content violates a local law. TikTok is committed to assisting law enforcement in appropriate circumstances while at the same time respecting the privacy and rights of our users. For more on our policies and practices, please see our Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines.To foster candid dialogue essential to earning and maintaining trust, we're releasing our first Transparency Report this year to show how we responsibly engage with government bodies in the markets where TikTok operates. In this report, users will find details pertaining to how we've responded to legal requests related to content and account information from January 1 – June 30, 2019. For example, the report shows how we responded to the 298 legal requests for information we received from 28 countries over this 6-month period. In balancing our responsibilities to law enforcement with our respect for the privacy of our users, we respond only to legally valid requests and only with the requisite amount of information needed.

From exciting, entertaining, and informative videos to showcasing their talents to a community, users of all ages can find a place on the app. While it's important for creators to express themselves originally, we understand that the full TikTok experience is not for all ages. There are several measures in place designed to help keep younger users safe while enjoying TikTok.We accommodate users under the age of 13 in a limited app experience - \"TikTok for Younger Users\" - that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for an audience that is under 13 years old. TikTok for Younger Users allows us to split users into age-appropriate TikTok environments, in line with FTC guidance for mixed audience apps. Users enter the appropriate app experience after passing through an age-gate when they register for a TikTok account. Within TikTok for Younger Users, users are provided a viewing experience that does not permit sharing of personal information and puts extensive limitations on content and user interaction. In this ecosystem, users cannot do things like share their videos, comment on others' videos, message with users, or maintain a profile or followers. However, they are able to experience what TikTok is at its core – showcasing creativity – as they enjoy curated content and experiment with TikTok’s unique, fanciful, and expressive features.In addition to the TikTok for Younger Users experience, TikTok has been given a 12+ rating in the Apple App and Google Play stores. Both iOS and Android provide parental controls that allow parents to block or limit specific apps, features, movies, music, and more at the device level. If you are a parent, this allows you to use controls built-in to the device, to simply block apps that have the 12+ rating from your child’s phone. Please see the Apple App Store or Google Play Store instructions for more on parental controls (or “restrictions”) and how to enable them.TikTok is committed to the safety of all users regardless of age and there are several resources and educational materials that can help users get the most out of their app experience.

In this post we want to clarify the timeline of events, apologize for an error, and explain more about our moderation philosophy and the next steps our team will be taking in our continued commitment to our community.First, a clarification on the timeline of eventsNovember 14, 2019 @ 2:34pm ET – On a previous account (@getmefamousplzsir), a TikTok user posted a video that included the image of Osama bin Laden, resulting in an account ban in line with TikTok's policies against content that includes imagery related to terrorist figures. No China-related content was moderated on this account.*While we recognize that this video may have been intended as satire, our policies on this front are currently strict. Any such content, when identified, is deemed a violation of our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service, resulting in a permanent ban of the account and associated devices.November 14, 2019 @ 7:53pm ET – The user posted to a newly-created, second TikTok account (@getmefamouspartthree). As of the time of this blog post, that account had 19 videos in total.November 23, 2019 @ 7:05pm ET – The user posted a video to that second account that talked about the Uighur community in China. As of the time of this blog post, the video has been viewed more than 1.5 million times on the app.November 25, 2019 @ 3:32am ET – As part of a scheduled platform-wide enforcement, the TikTok moderation team banned 2,406 devices associated with accounts that had been banned for one of three types of violations: (1) Terrorism or terrorist imagery, (2) Child exploitation, (3) Spam or similar malicious content. Because the user's banned account (@getmefamousplzsir) was associated with the same device as her second account (@getmefamouspartthree), this had the effect of locking her out of being able to access her second, active account from that device. However, the account itself remained active and accessible, with its videos continuing to receive views.November 27, 2019 @ 7:06am ET – Due to a human moderation error, the viral video from November 23 was removed. It's important to clarify that nothing in our Community Guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed. November 27, 2019 @ 7:56am ET – The video went live again on the platform after a senior member of our moderation team identified the error and reinstated it immediately.In total, the video was offline for 50 minutes. An apologyWe would like to apologize to the user for the error on our part this morning.In addition, we are reaching out to the user directly to inform her that we've decided to override the device ban in this case. Our moderation approach of banning devices associated with a banned account is designed to protect against the spread of coordinated malicious behavior – and it's clear that this was not the intent here. This user can again access her active account (@getmefamouspartthree) from the device she was using previously.Our moderation philosophy and commitment to our communityThe work of preserving TikTok as a safe, positive, and welcoming environment for our users, while also protecting our users' freedom of creative expression to post content that may be serious or uncomfortable, is complex and challenging. Like other internet platforms, we have invested enormous resources in technology that can act as a first line of defense against content that is clearly in violation of our Community Guidelines, such as displays of extreme violence, child exploitation, pornography, or spam. The second line of defense consists of human moderators operating on the basis of those Community Guidelines. Those individuals have an incredibly difficult task of reviewing many thousands of videos, and trying to make sound judgments where an answer is not always clear. We acknowledge that at times, this process will not be perfect. Humans will sometimes make mistakes, such as the one made today in the case of @getmefamouspartthree’s video. When those mistakes happen, however, our commitment is to quickly address and fix them, undertake trainings or make changes to reduce the risk of the same mistakes being repeated, and fully own the responsibility for our errors. To that end, we are reviewing both the procedural breakdown in this incident, as well as conducting a broader review on our process, to identify areas where we can improve our practices. We will also be reviewing our policies to allow carve-outs for things like education and satire, as other platforms do. To continue to provide transparency for our users, we will also be releasing our first transparency report as well a much fuller version of our Community Guidelines, both of which are on track to share with our community within the next two months.We remain committed to working collaboratively with our community and stakeholders to achieve our common goal of providing a platform that fulfills its core purpose of bringing creativity and joy to its users."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-celebrates-grammy-artists","date":"2019-11-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"TikTok celebrates Grammy artists","text":"Lizzo and Lil Nas X recently received well-deserved Grammy nominations and we want to send a heartfelt congratulations from the TikTok community!

With a private account you can approve or deny follower requests, and only users you’ve approved as followers can see your content.Whether you have a public or private account, anyone can choose to make a specific video private. Private videos are visible only to you, and you can select this setting when you originally upload the video or by later making an uploaded video private. Remove a followerIf you no longer want a user to follow your account for any reason, you can remove them from your followers from your \"Followers\" page or their profile. When a user is removed from your followers, your videos will not appear in their \"Following\" feed.To remove a follower from your \"Followers\" page simply tap the three dots next to their username and tap \"Remove this follower.\"To remove a follower from their profile page, tap the three dots in the top right hand corner and tap \"Remove this follower.\"If you have a public account, they will still have the opportunity to re-follow your account.

At TikTok, we have no higher priority than earning and preserving the trust of our users, partners and regulators, and we want to keep our community updated on the steps we are taking on these challenging but critically important issues.Over the past year, we have taken a number of concrete actions that we want to reiterate here so our stakeholders have full awareness.Building out a team of US-based leaders.Ever since I started in January as General Manager for the US, we have worked hard to build out a senior team of US leaders with wide and relevant industry experience to run TikTok here. Every day, our US team makes decisions that we see as best for the US market, and we are given the independence to do so. This allows us to focus on doing what’s best for our community here in the US.US-led content moderation.We understand the importance of localizing the complex and intricate process of content moderation. That's why we have US-based employees experienced in this sector leading the moderation efforts for TikTok US. TikTok uses a combination of machine learning tools and several rounds of human moderation to review content. Our US moderation team, which is led out of California, reviews content for adherence to our US policies, similar to other US companies in our space. In fact, over this year, we've built a robust team with expertise in the area of Trust & Safety based in the US, and we continue to invest heavily in this area.We are committed to providing a safe and expressive app experience for our community, and we aim to be a leader in this area, which is why we also recently announced plans to form a committee of outside experts to help ensure that TikTok is well prepared to serve our users and community effectively and responsibly.Localizing our Community Guidelines.Every market is different, and we realize that the best way to create the most vibrant and creative platform for the US is to improve localization and continue to build on our Community Guidelines, which will continue to evolve over time. As a platform that has an audience that includes high school students, user protection is a priority, which is why our Community Guidelines emphasize keeping TikTok a fun and safe community for our users. We remove content that violates those rules — like pornography, spam or violence — in a manner consistent with our values and industry standards.Prioritizing data security.We know that our users want to feel secure and informed when it comes to handling their data. Recognizing the importance of this issue, we want to be as transparent as possible in order to earn the trust and confidence of our US stakeholders in this crucial area. As we have said before, and recently confirmed through an independent security audit, we store all US user data in the United States, with backup redundancy in Singapore. TikTok’s data centers are located entirely outside of China. Further, we have a dedicated technical team focused on adhering to robust cybersecurity policies, and data privacy and security practices. In addition, we periodically conduct internal and external reviews of our security practices in an effort to ensure we are keeping up with current risks.Engaging with the community.TikTok team, senior staff and myself understand the importance of building a close and transparent working relationship with regulators and lawmakers. This will be increasingly important during the upcoming US election season. TikTok is a place for users to express their creativity in a lighthearted and fun way. We deeply value our community's diversity and authenticity, factors that help make the app such a unique and refreshing place. When we introduce new features or evaluate our policies, we are guided by this spirit and our mission to inspire creativity and bring joy. This is part of why we banned political advertising earlier this year — to safeguard what is unique about the TikTok user experience.We are grateful and proud that our young company has quickly earned its reputation with users as a fun, joyful place to create and watch entertaining short videos, and we are working to continue our growth in a way that is transparent and consistent in building confidence and trust with our most important stakeholders, our users. We will continue to update you as our policies on content moderation, data security, and user safety evolve in line with the values of our user base and the expectations of the regulatory community.We will continue to work with the US government on all of the issues discussed above."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/launching-share-to-tiktok-with-adobe-premiere-rush-and-more-partners","date":"2019-11-03T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Launching Share to TikTok with Adobe Premiere Rush and More Partners","text":"TikTok is always looking for ways to give our community new opportunities and fresh features to express themselves creatively.

They also have their finger on the pulse of TikTok, taking part in trends and posting content that resonates with their college. This video from Isaiah Thomas, a TikTok ambassador from the University of California, Irvine, shows the daily struggles of trying to get a good nights rest with a full course load, work, and social life:Kira Shannon, TikTok College Ambassador from Rhodes College, gives a #college101 tip for car use.Jonas Jacobson, TikTok College Ambassador from Davidson College, knows better than to think light coursework will last the whole semester.In support of the higher education, TikTok is teaming up with Thurgood Marshall College Fund to give away at least 20 scholarships up to $10,000 each to students at HBCUs. Students will have a chance to receive a scholarship by making a TikTok video that showcases their school spirit. To kick off the scholarship, TikTok and Warner Records are also throwing a concert series at HBCU universities across the United States. Students have until 11/13 to create a video and scholarship winners will be selected based on the creativity of their video. No matter who wins, we hope students will take this chance to show love for their universities like in this video from our Spelman College ambassador.College can be challenging and stressful, but TikTok gives students an outlet to show off their creativity and be their authentic selves. We hope this alleviates some of the pressure on their shoulders and makes the college experience a little more positive. With university specific videos, we hope TikTok will continue to bring students together while our ambassadors create events that will make their day."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/bring-it-on-trending-on-tiktok","date":"2019-10-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Bring it on: Trending on TikTok","text":"This week, creators went head to head with the #BringItOn trend, layered up for fall, and put on a scary face in anticipation of Halloween.

As a parent, you want to make sure that your teen is having a fun, safe experience while using the app. TikTok offers several tools to help your teen manage how they interact with other users and who can see their videos. This includes restrictions for privacy, content, comments, and messages. The following safety tools and features can be activated to ensure your teen has a positive, safe experience on TikTok.Private vs Public AccountsBy default, your account starts as public, which means any TikTok user can view your videos and post comments, reactions, or duets to engage with the content you've created and shared – but you can easily change this in your Privacy Settings. If you switch to a private account you can approve or deny follower requests, and only users you’ve approved as followers can see your content.To change your account from public to private:Go to the \"Privacy and Settings\" screen and tap Privacy and SafetyTurn Private Account onRestricting DuetsDuets can be a fun way to create videos with another user, but you’re in control: we give you the option to decide who can make duets with or react to your content. It's easy to set this just once at the account level and have your chosen setting apply to all your videos – but you can choose to selectively enable or disable duets for just a particular video, too.To enable restrictions on who can create duet videos with you:From your profile, open the Privacy and Safety settingsTap “Who Can Duet With Me”Choose the setting you prefer (Everyone, Friends, or Off)Enabling comment restrictionsTikTok also gives you the power you to choose who is allowed to comment on your videos. You can let anyone comment, restrict it to friends, or turn off comments completely.To enable this feature:From your profile, open the Privacy and Safety settingsTap \"Who Can Comment on My Videos\"Pick Everyone, Friends, or OffReporting a commentIf someone makes a comment that violates our Community Guidelines, you can take action by reporting that comment.To report a comment:Tap on the commentTap \"Report\"Unfollow a userIf your teen no longer wants to follow a user they can unfollow them.You can unfollow a user at any timeTap on \"Following\" to see who you're followingTap the \"Following' button to unfollow a userBlocking a userTikTok allows your teen to keep any users from interacting with them for any reason. By blocking a user they will not be able to view your teen's content or send them messages.If you would like to block a user simply:Go to that user's profileTap the three dots in the right cornerTap \"Block\"Report physical dangerIf your teen comes across content that may suggest immediate physical danger to another user, they should report it immediately.To report content for physical danger:Tap the arrow in the bottom right corner of the videoTap \"Report\"\"Violence or Harm\" or \"Self injury\" depending on the situationEnable Restricted ModeIf you’d like to limit content more quickly with a broader brush stroke, you can enable Restricted Mode. Restricted Mode is an option at the account settings level that limits the appearance of content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. Restricted Mode can always be turned off by the person who enabled it to begin with. So if your teen find themselves missing videos they want to see, you can switch it back for them whenever you’d like.To enable this setting:Select “Digital Wellbeing” under the app settingsTap “Turn On”Set a passcodeToggle “Restricted Mode”Set screen time limitsIn today’s digital age, it should come as no surprise that people spend most of their waking hours staring at a screen. To help offset some of that time, we’ve implemented a Screen Time Management feature to help you hold yourself to 2 hours on the app per day. With this setting enabled, you will need to enter your passcode to allow your teen to continue using TikTok past that time limit.To enable Screen Time Management:Select “Digital Wellbeing” under the app settingsTap “Turn On”Set a passcodeToggle “Screen Time Management”Not interested in videosIt's easy to like and share videos on TikTok, but what if your teen sees a video they don't like? Simply long-press on that video and tap the \"Not Interested\" icon. They’ll be shown less of that sort of video in the future. This function can be used on any video for any reason.We're constantly creating new tools for users to get the most out of TikTok. Keep an eye out for new safety features and policies that you or your teen can utilize during your time on the app."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-top-10-tips-for-parents","date":"2019-10-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Safety"],"title":"TikTok's Top 10 Tips for Parents","text":"TikTok is a short form video platform that offers in-app editing, effects, and sounds to help users develop imaginative memes and creative content. We know it's important that parents can feel comfortable that your teen is having a fun, safe experience while using the app, which is why TikTok provides you and your teen with a range of tools to put you in control.As with all apps your teen may use, it’s helpful to study the options you have to make it right for you and your family – and we hope you can use the below to set guidelines for their appropriate use of TikTok. Take time to explore the tips with your teen, scroll through our safety videos, and dive into the app together to help them learn about the features and settings that can help them customize their experience.Here are 10 tips to help keep your teen safely enjoying TikTok.Enable device-level parental controls. TikTok is intended for users 13 and over, and we've given it a 12+ app store rating. This allows you to use device-based parental controls provided by Google and Apple to block the app from an underage child's phone. For more, see instructions for iOS or Android for more on parental controls (or \"restrictions\") and how to enable them.Set your teen's account to private. By default, a TikTok account starts as public – but you can easily enable a private account in the privacy and safety settings. A private account means you can approve or deny follower requests, and only users you’ve approved as followers can see your content. Learn more about enabling a private account here.Decide who can follow you. Even if your teen has a private account, they can manage who follows their account by removing followers or blocking users and at any time, for any reason. Removing a follower will curtail that user's ability to send your teen a direct message, while blocking a user will also stop them from interacting with or viewing your teen's content at all.Limit the content you see. If your teen comes across a video that doesn’t vibe with what they want to watch, they can simply long-press on that video and tap 'Not Interested' to see less of that sort of video in the future. At the account level, enabling Restricted Mode is an option that limits the appearance of content that may not be appropriate for all audiences. Restricted Mode can always be adjusted if you'd like to disable it as your teen ages, but in the meantime you can set it behind a passcode for additional control.Control your comment section. Whether an account is private or public, your teen has the power to decide whether they want to allow comments on their videos from everyone, followers only – or restrict them altogether. Again, this can be set either at the account level, or adjusted for each individual video they create. And even with comments on, your teen can take granular control by enabling comment filters and setting a custom list of keywords that will be automatically blocked from any comments on their videos. Learn more about controlling comments here.Set messaging preferences. Messaging can be a great way to trade creative ideas with other users, but on TikTok only your teen's followers can send them a private message. Your teen can unfollow or block a user to curtail an individual's ability to send a DM, or disable messaging entirely from their privacy settings.Restrict duets. Duets can be a fun way to create videos with another user, but your teen has the control to decide who can make duets with or react to their content. They can set their preference just once at the account level and have the chosen setting apply to all their videos, or choose to selectively enable or disable duets for just a particular video.Report anything that violates our guidelines. TikTok is a community that embraces creativity and values support and positivity, and that code of conduct is outlined in our Community Guidelines. If your teen sees anything that they believe violates these guidelines, they can report content or a profile directly from within the app. Our community helps keep TikTok welcoming by adding unique, positive contributions and reporting misuse, spam, or anything else that doesn’t follow our Community Guidelines.Put a cap on screen time. Screen Time Management offers a way to limit the time your teen spends on the app each day. The feature, a part of our Digital Wellbeing offerings, lives behind a passcode and can be enabled for various time limits up to 2 hours. At the device level, screen time can also be managed directly through parental controls in Android and iOS device settings.Make videos together! TikTok is fun and easy to use. Join in on a trend or have fun with everyday moments together. Creating fun content with your teen can be a great way to get involved and learn about their interests.For more info on how to adjust your privacy settings and controls, check out our Parental Guide. There are several resources you can access directly from the Parents Portal in our Safety Center, including The Family Online Safety Institute's 7 Steps to Good Digital Parenting guide."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-commitment-to-our-users-and-the-tik-tok-experience","date":"2019-10-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Our commitment to our users and the TikTok experience","text":"By Vanessa Pappas, TikTok US General ManagerI joined TikTok at the start of this year because I found the platform's fun and entertaining environment to be a breath of fresh air in an online world that has increasingly migrated toward argument and divisiveness.

We are committed to meeting this responsibility fully.With this in mind, we want to share some of our near-term plans to further strengthen our teams, moderation policies, and overall transparency. To do this right, we will leverage a combination of internal and external resources to help ensure that TikTok is well prepared to serve our users and community effectively and responsibly.Working with me and my team throughout this process will be an outstanding group from the global law firm K&L Gates LLP, including former Congressmen Bart Gordon and Jeff Denham, who bring excellent expertise in the technology sector. The external team that we've brought on for this project will collaborate with our internal US management team to work on several key initiatives:Create a committee of outside experts to advise on and review content moderation policies covering a wide range of topics, including child safety, hate speech, misinformation, bullying, and other potential issues.Further increase transparency around our content moderation policies and the practices we employ to protect our community.Build out an even deeper bench of internal leaders so that we are well prepared to tackle the challenges that our continued rapid expansion will bring.These steps are just the latest efforts in our ongoing commitment to maintaining the app experience users expect while providing them the protections they deserve, and we will continue to provide updates and transparency in the months and years ahead."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/trending-on-tik-tok","date":"2019-10-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Walk it back: Trending on TikTok","text":"This week, TikTok creators got out of sticky situations with the #walkitback trend, celebrated National Coming Out Day with #ThisIsMe, and got into the lab with science experiments.

We know users gravitate to TikTok because it provides a positive, refreshing environment that inspires their creativity, and we look to foster that through things like fun filters, product features, and brand partnerships.This creativity is also where we're seeing brands have the most success on the platform as they embrace the unique spirit and authenticity of the TikTok community. Through native advertising formats – like sponsored hashtag challenges that invite user participation and engagement in a brand's campaign, or in-feed ads that use the immersive, short-form TikTok style – brands are using the app to take an unconventional and modern marketing approach.The decision to allow paid ads into the community experience is one we treat carefully. We're in the early days of introducing and experimenting with different ad formats, and we're exploring a variety of opportunities for brand partners – including the newly-launched TikTok Creator Marketplace, a beta program that enables brands to discover, connect, and engage with talented creators on marketing campaigns. Brands are increasingly looking to creators for insights and partnerships in building quality content, and we see demand for more collaborative opportunities between brands and creators.Throughout all of this, however, our primary focus is on creating an entertaining, genuine experience for our community. While we explore ways to provide value to brands, we're intent on always staying true to why users uniquely love the TikTok platform itself: for the app's light-hearted and irreverent feeling that makes it such a fun place to spend time.In that spirit, we have chosen not to allow political ads on TikTok. Any paid ads that come into the community need to fit the standards for our platform, and the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience. To that end, we will not allow paid ads that promote or oppose a candidate, current leader, political party or group, or issue at the federal, state, or local level – including election-related ads, advocacy ads, or issue ads. For more, see our ad guidelines.For us, it all points back to our mission: to inspire creativity and build joy. We want to ensure we're building a place where our community – users, creators, and brands – can be creative, build trends, and have a whole lot of fun in the process. People come to TikTok because it just feels different from so many other places, and we'll continue to work hard to support that."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-life-is-kind-of-crazy-trending-on-tiktok","date":"2019-09-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Our life is kind of crazy: Trending on TikTok","text":"This week, TikTok creators revealed their origins while gamers transported themselves in their favorite video games and dorm life popped off.

From all of us at TikTok, congratulations to Lil Nas X on your historic accomplishment and thank you for the joy you’ve brought audiences everywhere.\"When Lil Nas X uploaded \"Old Town Road\" to TikTok, no one could have predicted the impact it would have on his life and American pop culture. Then a 19 year old from Atlanta had been promoting his song on several channels with limited success, but it wasn't until the song's catchy drop, TikTok community's reach, and an important meme helped start Old Town Road on its journey to becoming the biggest song of all time. So tack up your horse and put on your matte black boots to take a walk back down with us.Drink the Yee Yee JuiceIn April, TikTok was taken over by a very specific meme. Short videos of people sipping E-Juice, finding out it was Yee Yee Juice, and magically transforming into old west outfits filled the feeds. And behind every transformation, a short clip of \"Old Town Road\" played. Lil Nas X had attempted to promote his song on other platforms to less enthusiasm, but the combination of country and trap music mixed with the perfectly timed drop made it the ideal sound for a TikTok video. As the videos racked up views and hearts, the song spread. Fans loved the short clip in the meme so much that they found \"Old Town Road\" on streaming services and pushed it to the Billboard charts.Lil Nas X himself credits TikTok and its users with helping \"Old Town Road\" reach the charts. He stopped by TikTok's LA office and spoke about his love for the community. \"TikTok helped me change my life,\" says Nas. \"TikTok brought my song to several different audiences at once.\"After a brief controversy about the songs genre, Lil Nas X teamed up with Billy Ray Cyrus to make the song's first remix. The new version climbed the Billboard Top 100 where it's stayed as the number one song for 17 weeks as of now. And all because someone drank a little #YeeYeeJuice.#CowboyGang Goes Down and Past the Old Town RoadAfter Lil Nas X became a household name, the artist took to his newfound stardom seamlessly. He made a star studded music video, dropped his first EP that included the top 100 song Panini, and performed live for thousands of fans at festivals across the world.Since the rise of Lil Nas X, \"Old Town Road\" has moved past it's \"Yee-Yee\" meme roots and into other types of videos on TikTok. Several well received remixes have sparked newly inspired content including time travelers bringing news of remixes to come, stop motion music videos, and makeup tutorials - including Billy Ray Cyrus, as himself. The song has spread all over TikTok and evolved into an anthem beyond the meme.Only time will tell how long \"Old Town Road\" reigns at the top of the charts, but watching Lil Nas X use TikTok to start and continue his journey as a music icon has been a better ride for us than any horse could offer.

Emerging musicians are using the platform as a way to get their songs, hooks, and all-around interesting musical moments into the ears of potential fans. Lil Nas X topped the charts after going viral on TikTok with \"Old Town Road\" but there are a slew of up and coming talents that have taken to the app and seen the love for their songs catch the eye of the record industry.Sub UrbanNew Jersey based artist, Sub Urban found initial popularity on TikTok when his song Cradles took off in tandem with a dance from Fortnite. Over 5 million videos featuring the dreamy song have been created going past the original dance craze and into other forms of artistic and creative content. It was the backdrop to a popular egg trend and countless art projects. Since then, the song has received over 17 million plays on Spotify and 22 million views on YouTube, showing that if users love 15 seconds of a song, they're willing to seek out the full version online. Sub Urban's viral success also nabbed him a record deal with Warner Music group. We're excited to see how Sub Urban continues to build on his viral success going forward. Sueco the ChildLos Angeles rapper Sueco the Child's rise on TikTok has been the same as the song that went viral, Fast. Unlike Cradles, Fast didn't rise with a specific trend but was simply used because of its enticing intro and mellow lyrics. The song has been used in over 3.3 million videos that range from shoe painting to getting ready for prom. Since going viral, Sueco has signed with Atlantic Records who's president was quoted in an article for Time saying, \"We’re not in the business of signing artists that we don’t think are going to have a long, robust career. He’s a producer, a songwriter, an artist -- he’s so versatile and so much broader than just what you hear and see with ‘Fast.’\"Blanco BrownBlanco Brown's \"The Git Up\" is the latest song to take over TikTok with an infectious tune and catchy dance. Brown's song blurs the lines between rap and country (where have we heard of this) in a genre he calls \"trailertrap.\" Broken Bow Records changed saw potential and pushed up the release schedule after \"Old Town Road\" paved the way for another country trap hit. Since it's appeared on TikTok, the song has been used in over 2 million videos with the two-step taking over the app.With new songs and trends gaining popularity on TikTok every day and the music industry's eye on the app, expect to see your next favorite artist to surface on TikTok."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/thank-you-we-designed-it-trending-on-tiktok","date":"2019-06-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Thank you we designed it: Trending on TikTok","text":"It's officially summer and users are ready for warm weather, designing their trendy looks, and earning clout.

This post is part of our Community Well-Being series that aims to educate users on how to customize their TikTok experience using the various safety, privacy, and well-being tools available to them.We take our Community Guidelines seriously, because we're committed to keeping TikTok a positive, welcoming space where every user can nurture their creativity and find entertainment.

Our moderation team works hard to remove content that violates our guidelines, but we also encourage our global TikTok community to help by reporting any inappropriate content you may come across.What type of content should you report?In short, anything that violates our Community Guidelines should be reported (for a refresher, check out this post). Here are a few examples of what might break from what's appropriate.Self injury. Being an active TikTok user means making sure your fellow community members feel safe and supported. Positive comments are always a do, but if someone's content has you wanting to offer additional resources, submitting a report is one of the ways you can help.Harassment or bullying. If you feel someone is harassing you or otherwise being inappropriate, please report them so our moderation team can review and take appropriate action.Hate Speech. Hate speech is not permitted on TikTok, period. We are committed to promoting a safe and positive app environment for our global community and there is absolutely no place for discrimination, including hate speech, on this platform. If you aren’t sure if something qualifies as hate speech, report it with a note and our moderators will jump in to review.Nudity. Our community is not the place for sexually explicit content. If you happen to find something that isn’t suitable to be done or shown in public view, report it.Copyright infringement. TikTok is a place for creativity and expression that’s unique and original.

With videos focusing on self-love, personal accomplishments, and amazing feats of athleticism, they showed that there's nothing \"she\" can't do. We also invited a few of our favorite female LA creators to the first annual TikTok #SheDidThat International Women's Day Brunch as a celebration of girl power! This group showed off their individuality and empowerment.The event was filled with creative activities that promoted positivity and acceptance. Some of our favorites were the calligraphy station, where guests thought of positive affirmations for themselves and professional calligraphy artists wrote them down as a permanent reminder, a frame painting station, where they could flex their own artistic muscles and customize each frame to match their sparkling personalities (though, it didn't always work out), and the stereotype shatter, where women took turns hitting a piñata that was covered in negative stereotypes. After the activities, our creators stood in front of the group and shared more personal stories about themselves. Using the prompt \"What makes you YOU?\" the women took a moment to explain the struggles and accomplishments that made up their journey so far. These included business goals, personal achievements, and overcoming modern stereotypes that all women face. The group supported each other and bonded over similar challenges they've experienced. It was a brunch full of positivity, support, new friends and maybe even long lost twins.TikTok would not be the community it is without the women who use the app or the women who work on it behind the scenes. As a company we are extremely proud of the work our female team members do and appreciate them every day in addition to the special holidays.

Oceana, which focuses on protecting the world’s oceans and its wildlife, recently took eight lucky TikTok Creators on an ocean excursion to Catalina Island to see first-hand how the community’s charitable donations will make an impact.Starting their adventure, the group boarded a boat headed for explored Bird Rock, just off Catalina Island, to explore a sea lion rookery which is home to sea lions (obviously), seagulls, and cormorants. This incredible experience allowed creators to interact with creatures in their natural habitat, and observe other wildlife on the crossing from Alamitos Bay, including a heron, a juvenile bald eagle hunting for fish, and several large pods of dolphins. TikTok creators swam, explored and gained exposure (many, for the first time) to marine wildlife and had a first hand vantage point of how the donations they helped raise with TikTok are being utilized to protect our oceans.We’re proud to partner with Oceana and support their work to reduce bycatch of marine wildlife, defend laws that protect marine mammals and advocate for protecting important marine habitats. There’s no better way to show the importance of Oceana’s work than by having our own community capture these moments.This excursion allowed TikTok users to get a closer look at the affected wildlife and explore their natural habitats while documenting the once in a lifetime ocean excursion.We love the passion and commitment our community has for doing good, and look forward to working closely with our creators and charity partners to bring more initiatives like these to life.Watch the content from TikTok creators!@mannbilly@wilkingsisters@mackenziesol@rtk"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/gamersontiktok","date":"2019-03-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"Gamers level up on TikTok","text":"Gaming and social media have exploded in mainstream popularity over the past generation, joining hands to amplify each others success. This partnership has been on full display as gamers utilize TikTok to create and share videos across social platforms, showing an original, creative side of gamers that strikes a chord with anyone who's ever picked up a controller. With the popularity of video games – particularly among Millennials and Gen Z – gaming has birthed a rapidly growing fan base that's searching for the best ways to create and view new content around their favorite games. TikTok lets gamers use the short-form video format to focus on specific moments, the player, and culture surrounding the games and consoles they love (and love to hate). TikTok makes it easy for anyone to create entertaining short-form videos, and encourages users to make videos about their passions. Using TikTok's unique format and editing tools, gamers have developed a creative way to show off their skills, make inside jokes, and depict the emotions surrounding gaming culture. Take, for example, a trending video format where players reminisce on consoles past, set to nostalgic music from the movie \"Up.\" Countless gamers can identify with this feeling and they join in on TikTok, creating their own emotional video game moments to share with the community.Gameplay continues to have a vital role in the content, but short-form video parameters push creators to show off specific skills instead of playing lengthy games with several minutes of down time. If you're not familiar with specific video games, this can also be an entertaining introduction. The community is loving this video from Fortnite, where one gamer creates a song using items, game mechanics, and what we assume is a hefty chunk of free time.TikTok offers a view of gaming that anyone can relate to, but inside jokes focusing solely on culture are also flourishing. Duets about the pains of picking characters for the game you're about to play, commentary on which video game console is the best, and videos of people misusing their systems are just a few topics that only gamers will understand but have found success on TikTok. There are even videos made specifically for gaming significant others. This type of content allows gamers to laugh at what it means to be a gamer instead of focusing on specific gaming titles or competitions. It's content about a community.As more gamers flock to TikTok, we're excited to watch the gaming community fuel originality and continue to build upon the wave of popularity that is modern gaming. The popularity of video game content on TikTok is a signal that gaming culture has found a new home to show its creativity and continue to grow an established community."},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-is-on-giphy","date":"2019-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"TikTok is on Giphy!","text":"TikTok and Giphy have joined forces to bring some of the best visual videos, previously only found on TikTok, to the GIF format!

While we’ve always seen TikTok as a place for everyone, we understand the concerns that arise around younger users. In working with the FTC and in conjunction with today’s agreement, we’ve now implemented changes to accommodate younger US users in a limited, separate app experience that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for this audience.We have always worked to provide our users with the best possible platform to foster their creativity. Beginning today, this additional app experience now allows us to split users into age-appropriate TikTok environments, in line with FTC guidance for mixed audience apps. The new environment for younger users does not permit the sharing of personal information, and it puts extensive limitations on content and user interaction. Both current and new TikTok users will be directed to the age-appropriate app experience, beginning today.From viral videos to tender moments, TikTok allows users from all walks of life to be their authentic selves while delighting in spontaneous humor and global trends. In the younger ecosystem, users cannot do things like share their videos on TikTok, comment on others' videos, message with users, or maintain a profile or followers. However, they will be able to experience what TikTok is at its core – showcasing creativity – as they enjoy curated content and experiment with TikTok’s unique, fanciful, and expressive features.We care deeply about the safety and privacy of our users. This is an ongoing commitment, and we are continuing to expand and evolve our protective measures in support of this.

In this post we’ll go through a few of these options.Making a video privateWith a private account, only users you’ve approved as followers can see your videos – but you can always choose to make a specific video private, too. Private videos are visible only to you, no matter whether you have a public or a private account. You can make this choice when you originally upload the video or by later making an uploaded video private.To upload a private video:On the video posting page for your draft video, tap “Who can view my video”Choose “Private”Remember that you can always choose to make a previously-uploaded video private by tapping the lock symbol on the video then choosing \"Private.\"Setting comment controls on your videosWho do you want to be allowed to comment on your videos? You decide! To access and configure your privacy controls, head on over to the Privacy and Safety option under the app settings. Here, you can view and adjust your privacy controls at any time.To control who can comment on your videos:From your profile, open the Privacy and Safety settingsTap “Who Can Comment on My Videos”Choose either “Everyone” (anyone who can view your videos), “Friends” (mutual followers only), or “Off” (no one)Of course, you can disable comments for a specific video instead of all your videos. Just open the video you want to restrict comments on, tap the menu button, and select \"Comments Off.\"Restricting duets on your videosDuets can be a fun way to create videos with another user, but you’re in control: we give you the option to decide who can make duets with or react to your content. It's easy to set this just once at the account level and have your chosen setting apply to all your videos – but you can choose to selectively enable or disable duets for just a particular video, too.To enable restrictions on who can create duet videos with you:From your profile, open the Privacy and Safety settingsTap “Who Can Duet With Me”Choose the setting you prefer (Everyone, Friends, or Off)You also have the option of disabling duets for just a specific video.

We created a Safety Center to help you learn about many of the options TikTok offers, plus helpful online resources more generally – but in this blog series we want to explain all of this step-by-step!A big part of establishing a great TikTok experience is understanding how to secure your presence on the app from the get-go. There are numerous settings at your fingertips that allow you to control what you want your TikTok experience to look like, and in this post, we’re going to start from the beginning: setting up your account.Use a strong passwordStrong passwords are essential for protecting your personal information and identity online. While you’re probably familiar with what makes a password strong, here are some tips — just in case you need a refresher — to keep in mind when creating your TikTok account.Don’t use the same password across multiple sites or appsSkip common phrases or easy-to-guess info like your name, 1234, etc.Combine upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbolsMake your password longer and more complex (you might also consider using a password management tool)Avoid choosing passwords that could be guessed by people you know or by someone glancing at your TikTok profileBe thoughtful about the info you put in your profileEven with a private account, your profile information – including profile photo, username, and bio – will be visible to all users. So while it's a good idea to avoid including things like your city or other identifiers, there's plenty of other ways to express yourself in your profile. Think about options like:A quote or song lyricsYour favorite hobbies or sportsHashtags or emojisThe strangest flavors of ice cream you’ve ever combinedChoosing a public or private accountWhether you want to share your videos with the world or just your closest friends, the choice is up to you.By default, your account starts as public, which means any TikTok user can view your videos and post comments, reactions, or duets to engage with the content you've created and shared – but you can easily change this in your Privacy Settings.If you switch to a private account you can approve or deny follower requests, and only users you’ve approved as followers can see your content.Whether you have a public or private account, anyone can choose to make a specific video private. Private videos are visible only to you, and you can select this setting when you originally upload the video or by later making an uploaded video private.Remember:Information you put in your profile will be visible to all usersYou can edit your privacy settings by visiting the Privacy and Safety tab on your profile pageYou may not use TikTok if you are under 13, or the minimum age for your country or region if designated differently in the Terms of Service"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/the-battle-of-the-century-right-here-on-tiktok","date":"2018-12-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["News"],"title":"The Battle of the Century, right here on TikTok","text":"Here's how the #WrapBattle all went off:Round 1 - Cardi B challenges Offset to high stakes; loser has to buy the Xmas decorations for the house (both of them).Round 2 - Offset flows like a butterfly, stings like a bee, accepts wifey's duel.Round 3 - The battle wraps up on Cardi and Offset's TikToks.Round 4 - Up next in the ring, Awkwafina!This #WrapBattle will go down in history!"},{"platform":"TikTok","url":"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/stopspeaksupport-to-tackle-cyberbullying-in-the-uk","date":"2018-11-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community"],"title":"#StopSpeakSupport to tackle cyberbullying in the UK","text":"TikTok partnered with UK's Anti-Bullying Alliance to tackle cyberbullying by hosting the #StopSpeakSupport challenge on the platform.
