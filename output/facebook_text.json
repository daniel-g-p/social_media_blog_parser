Having a personal intimate image shared with others can be scary and overwhelming, especially for young people. It can feel even worse when someone tries to use those images as a threat for additional images, sexual contact or money — a crime known as sextortion. Take It Down lets young people take back control of their intimate images. People can go to TakeItDown.NCMEC.org and follow the instructions to submit a case that will proactively search for their intimate images on participating apps. Take It Down assigns a unique hash value — a numerical code — to their image or video privately and directly from their own device. Once they submit the hash to NCMEC, companies like ours can use those hashes to find any copies of the image, take them down and prevent the content from being posted on our apps in the future. Built in a way that respects young peoples’ privacy and data security, Take It Down allows people to only submit a hash — rather than the intimate image or video itself — to NCMEC. Hashing turns images or videos into a coded form that can no longer be viewed, producing hashes that are secure digital fingerprints. With the launch of Take It Down, people of all ages can stop the spread of their intimate images online, including: Young people under 18 years old worried their content has been or will be posted online Parents or trusted adults on behalf of a young person Adults who are worried about images taken of them when they were under 18. Take It Down was designed with Meta’s financial support. We are working with NCMEC to promote Take It Down across our platforms, in addition to integrating it into Facebook and Instagram so people can easily access it when reporting potentially violating content. Take It Down builds off of the success of platforms like StopNCII, a platform we launched in 2021 with South West Grid for Learning (SWGfL) and more than 70 NGO’s worldwide, which helps adults stop the spread of their intimate images online, a practice commonly referred to as “revenge porn.” Meta doesn’t allow content or behavior that exploits young people, including the posting of intimate images or sextortion activities. We work to prevent this content as well as inappropriate interactions between young people and suspicious accounts attempting to take advantage of them. For example, we default teens into the most private settings on Facebook and Instagram, we work to restrict suspicious adults from connecting with teens on those apps, and we educate teens about the dangers of engaging with adults they do not know online. We’ve also made it easier for people to report potentially harmful content, particularly if it involves a child. On Instagram, we recently introduced new features to make it even more difficult for suspicious adults to interact with teens. Now, these adults will no longer be able to see teen accounts when scrolling through the list of people who have liked a post or when looking at an account’s Followers or Following list. If a suspicious adult follows a teen account, we will send that teen a notification prompting them to review and remove the new follower. We are also prompting teens to review and restrict their privacy settings. When someone comments on a teen’s post, tags/mentions them in another post, or includes their content in Reels Remixes or Guides, the teen will receive a notification to review their privacy settings, and will have the option to stop people from interacting with them. We’ve developed more than 30 tools to support the safety of teens and families across our apps, including supervision tools for parents and age-verification technology that helps teens have age-appropriate experiences online. We also provide resources for teens that inform them of the potential harms of taking intimate images, and the other ways they can find help if they want to stop the spread of that content. There are more resources for parents so they can talk to their teens about how to be safe online in our Safety Center and Family Center."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/metas-integrity-and-transparency-reports-q4-2022/","date":"2023-02-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Integrity and Transparency Reports, Fourth Quarter 2022","text":"Today, we’re publishing our quarterly reports for the fourth quarter of 2022 including the Community Standards Enforcement Report, the Widely Viewed Content Report, Oversight Board Quarterly Update and the Adversarial Threat Report. All reports are available in the Transparency Center. Our report highlights include: The Adversarial Threat Report Over the past five years, we’ve shared our findings about threats we detect and remove from our platforms. In today’s threat report, we’re sharing information about three networks we took down for violating our policies against coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) and mass reporting (or coordinated abusive reporting) during the last quarter to make it easier for people to see the progress we’re making in one place. We’re also providing an update on our work against influence operations — both covert and overt — in a year since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We have shared information about our findings with industry partners, researchers and policymakers. The Community Standards Enforcement Report In the fourth quarter, we continue to make progress on removing content that violates our Community Standards with prevalence remaining relatively consistent across a wide range of violation areas. Separately, we’ve updated our cross-problem AI system, combining several models so that we’re consolidating learnings across hate speech, bullying and harassment and violence and incitement. This and other continued improvements or adjustments to proactive detection technology, in many instances, lead to improved accuracy. We also consistently refine our methodology for this report in an effort to improve the metrics we provide. This quarter we’ve updated how we calculate proactive rate. As a result of these improvements, we’re seeing several shifts in the proactive rates across different areas. This methodology update only changes how we measure the proactive rate metric, but not our approach to proactively identifying violating content. The Widely Viewed Content Report This quarter’s report includes one case of engagement bait and one piece of content removed because it was posted by a Page that was taken down for repeatedly violating our Community Standards. We rigorously work to understand the content ecosystem and evaluate how effective our policies and integrity measures are so we can close the gaps we find along the way. The Oversight Board Quarterly Update The Oversight Board is a valuable source of external perspective and accountability for Meta that people can appeal to if they disagree with content enforcement decisions on Facebook and Instagram. We’re committed to implementing all of the Board’s content decisions and responding to all of their recommendations publicly, having already committed to implement — or explore the feasibility of implementing — 78% of their recommendations to date. Q4 marked two years since the Oversight Board’s first decision and we closed the quarter with building a framework to expand the Board’s scope and impact. This collaboration with the Board resulted in finalizing a series of updates that will streamline the Board’s operations and allow them to more efficiently select, deliberate and make decisions on tough issues. Over the past two years the Oversight Board has given us valuable feedback on our policies and processes which has led to real changes. For example, we recently completed a global rollout of more informative user messaging to let people know whether human or automated review was responsible for the removal of their content. Also prompted by feedback from the Oversight Board, we are sharing more details about steps we’re taking to update Facebook’s penalty system. We continue to invest in refining our policies and improving our enforcement, and as part of that work, we are updating our penalty system to make it more fair and effective. Under the new system, we will focus on helping people understand why we have removed their content, which is shown to be more effective at preventing re-offending, rather than so quickly restricting their ability to post. We are still removing violating content just as we did before, but now we’re also giving people the chance to change their behavior while still applying stronger penalties to more severe violations: posting content that includes terrorism, child exploitation, human trafficking, serious suicide promotion, sexual exploitation, the sale of non-medical drugs, or the promotion of dangerous individuals and organizations. This leads to faster and more impactful actions for those that continuously violate our policies. These changes follow feedback from our community — including our civil rights auditors, the Oversight Board and independent experts — who noted that our current systems needed better balance between punishing and encouraging remediation through education. Other updates We revamped our Pages, Groups and Events policies to streamline, clarify and ensure the policies remain relevant and accurate. We updated the notifications people see on Facebook when they try to view content that has been restricted due to local laws. In most cases, the notification will now include information letting them know which government authority sent the take down request resulting in the restriction. These changes are an important part of our commitment under our Corporate Human Rights Policy and as a member of the Global Network Initiative. More details about our approach to content restrictions can be found in the Transparency Center. Our Ongoing Commitment Our commitment to integrity is ongoing, and we will continue to update, improve and evolve our policy enforcement in an ever-changing environment. We are focused on preserving people’s ability to connect with each other around the world, particularly during times of crisis. We also want to ensure businesses that rely on our apps to reach customers have access to the support they need. From global brands to the local coffee shop, we know that businesses can be targets for adversarial activity which can disrupt their operations. So we will continue to focus heavily on improving overall support for business users."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/meta-is-improving-facebooks-penalty-system/","date":"2023-02-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"How We’re Improving Facebook’s Penalty System","text":"Today, as prompted by feedback from the Oversight Board’s continued push to ensure our penalty system is more proportionate, we’re taking steps to update Facebook’s penalty system to make it more effective and fair. Since nothing is changing about the underlying content removal, we do not anticipate this penalty system refinement to have a material effect on prevalence. With this update we will still be able to keep our app safe while also allowing people to express themselves. Under the new system, we will focus on helping people understand why we have removed their content, which is shown to be more effective at preventing re-offending, rather than so quickly restricting their ability to post. We will still apply account restrictions to persistent violators, typically beginning at the seventh violation, after we’ve given sufficient warnings and explanations to help the person understand why we removed their content. We will also restrict people from posting in groups at lower thresholds where warranted. For more serious violations: posting content that includes terrorism, child exploitation, human trafficking, suicide promotion, sexual exploitation, the sale of non-medical drugs or the promotion of dangerous individuals and organizations, we will continue to apply immediate consequences, including account removal in severe cases. The vast majority of people on our apps are well-intentioned. Historically, some of those people have ended up in “Facebook jail” without understanding what they did wrong or whether they were impacted by a content enforcement mistake. Our analysis has found that nearly 80% of users with a low number of strikes do not go on to violate our policies again in the next 60 days. This means that most people respond well to a warning and explanation since they don’t want to violate our policies. But at the same time, some people are determined to post violating content regardless of our policies. Our analysis suggests that applying more severe penalties at the seventh strike is a more effective way to give well-intentioned people the guidance they need while still removing bad actors. As well as being more effective, these changes will be fairer to those people who may have been disproportionately impacted by our old system, particularly when we made an incorrect moderation decision or missed context. For example, someone may jokingly post, “I’m on my way to kidnap you,” not knowing that this statement could violate our violence and incitement policy, when really it was a post about taking a friend out for dinner after that person had a rough day. Someone else might post a friend’s name and address as a way of sharing information for a party, and without that context, that post might appear to be sharing personally identifiable information in violation of our policies. The implications of overenforcement are real — when people are unintentionally caught up in this system, they may find it hard to run their business, connect with their communities or express themselves. Our previous system resorted quickly to long penalties, such as a 30-day block on a person’s ability to create content. These long blocks were frustrating for well-intentioned people who had made mistakes, and they did little to help those people understand our policies. The blocks also made it harder for us to spot violation trends and sometimes had the effect of letting bad actors stay on the site longer. Our new system, which reduces the number of restriction periods, will allow us to detect persistent violators in less time, leading to faster and more impactful actions. Today’s changes, while based on our own analysis and feedback of the Oversight Board, are also responsive to feedback from our community — including our civil rights auditors — who noted that our current enforcement system needs more focus on proportionality. Independent experts who offered their guidance on this topic have routinely noted that our penalty system should have a better balance between punishing and encouraging remediation through education. “…It is positive that Meta has introduced further transparency and coherence in this area as a result of implementing prior Oversight Board recommendations, moving towards what should be a more proportionate and transparent approach with higher strike-to-penalty thresholds. Meta’s plans to issue more comprehensive penalty notifications should ensure that users are better placed to understand the reasons for the consequences of strikes and the reasons for feature-limits in the future.” – Oversight Board Iran protest slogan Case Decision External guidance is an important part of this process, and we’ll continue to work with experts in academia, civil society and the policy community to continue to improve and evolve our policy enforcement in an ever changing environment. We will provide more updates as this process continues."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/increasing-our-ads-transparency/","date":"2023-02-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Meta"],"title":"Increasing Our Ads Transparency","text":"Today, we are launching the next iteration of the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool, which we created nearly a decade ago to give people information about why they see certain ads across our technologies. Since its initial launch, we’ve made improvements to “Why am I seeing this ad?” to make it easier to use and understand. Today’s update takes it one step further and now includes information about how we use machine learning models to show people ads. What’s New Beginning today, the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool on Facebook will include: Information summarized into topics about how your activity both on and off our technologies — such as liking a post on a friend’s Facebook page or interacting with your favorite sports website — may inform the machine learning models we use to shape and deliver the ads you see. New examples and illustrations explaining how our machine learning models connect various topics to show you relevant ads. More ways to find our ads controls. You will now be able to access Ads Preferences from additional pages in the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool. Why We Built This We worked closely with external privacy experts and policy stakeholders from around the world to get input on what transparency changes they want to see in our ads system. A consistent answer was that we should increase our transparency around how our machine learning models contribute to the ads people see on our services. We are committed to using machine learning models responsibly. Being transparent about how we use machine learning is essential because it ensures that people are aware that this technology is a part of our ads system and that they know the types of information it is using. By stepping up our transparency around how our machine learning models work to deliver ads, we aim to help people feel more secure and increase our accountability. The changes we’re making to “Why am I seeing this ad?” reflect the feedback we’ve received and are designed to provide people with clear information about the machine learning models that help determine the ads they see. These new features are the latest step in our continuous evolution of “Why am I seeing this ad?” We will continue to improve our ads transparency offerings and search for new ways to provide people with better understanding of how we use data and technology to show them ads. Where Can I Find “Why am I seeing this ad?” You can click on the three-dot menu in the upper-right-hand corner of any ad you see in your Facebook Feed and navigate to “Why am I seeing this ad.” If an explanation in the tool is unclear or confusing, we want to hear about it. You can use the feedback tool at the bottom of “Why am I seeing this ad?” to tell us about your experience and how we can do better. As always, you can still hide all ads from a given advertiser and access your ads preferences from the “Why am I seeing this ad?” interface. This updated version of “Why am I seeing this ad?” is rolling out globally on Facebook first, and we plan on expanding it to Instagram in the future."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/helping-creators-and-publishers-manage-intellectual-property/","date":"2023-01-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta"],"title":"Helping Creators and Publishers Manage Intellectual Property with Rights Manager","text":"Today, we’re launching a website dedicated solely to helping educate people on the way Rights Manager combats copyright infringement and protects lawful expression on Facebook and Instagram.

From ongoing improvements to our privacy program to strides being made in end-to-end encryption, here’s a look at what we’ve been up to and where we’re going. Showing Our Work Today, we’re publishing the third iteration of our Privacy Progress Update, which we publish each year to demonstrate technical and operational improvements we’ve made. This latest version includes details on privacy governance, consumer-facing privacy controls and innovative privacy solutions like privacy aware infrastructure. We remain as committed as ever to putting people’s privacy first in everything we do. Building Educational Tools We launched Privacy Center alongside our easier to understand Privacy Policy last year to give people a place where they could learn more about our approach to privacy across our apps and technologies. Privacy Center is now fully available on Facebook. We’ve also added two new modules to Privacy Center — one focused on safety, where people can learn more about how they can protect themselves and their information; and one focused on privacy for teens, where people can learn about the special protections we offer for young people. Giving People Control We want people to understand their options when it comes to privacy on our apps. That’s why we’re notifying people on Facebook to take a Privacy Checkup to review some of their important privacy settings. Whether you’re tweaking your audience settings or setting up two-factor authentication, it’s always worth examining your settings on a regular basis, and people can also now set a recurring reminder for Privacy Checkup to be automatically notified to use the control. Protecting Teen Privacy In November, we introduced updates on Facebook and Instagram that further protect teens online. Now, everyone who is under the age of 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into more private settings when they join Facebook. Earlier this year, we announced that we’re further restricting the options advertisers have to reach teens, as well as the information we use to show ads to teens. Age and location will be the only information about a teen that we’ll use to show them ads. We’ve also added a new privacy page with more information for teens about the tools and privacy settings they can use across our technologies. Advancing Private Messaging We’ve introduced a number of new privacy features on WhatsApp to give you even more control. You can now leave group messages without notifying everyone, choose who can see when you’re online and prevent screenshots on View Once messages. And on Messenger, we’re announcing new product features for your end-to-end encrypted chats, as well as increased testing for default end-to-end encryption. Prioritizing Privacy as We Help Build the Metaverse The metaverse presents an opportunity for us to build privacy into a new technology from the ground up and we’ve been working with experts in academia, civil rights groups and industry organizations to help ensure we’re innovating in this new space responsibly. We are committed to baking in strong privacy protections from the start, and developing transparent tools to let people be in control of their experience. This guided our development of features like eye-tracking and Natural Facial Expressions in our Meta Quest Pro virtual reality headset. We took a similar approach with our Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, which feature an LED light to let people know when photos or videos are being captured and a power switch to toggle the glasses on and off. Visit our privacy microsite for more information on these features and tips on how people can use the glasses safely and responsibly. We look forward to sharing more updates on how we’re helping to build the metaverse with privacy in mind."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/centralizing-apps-settings-in-accounts-center/","date":"2023-01-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Messenger"],"title":"Centralizing Your Apps Settings in Accounts Center","text":"Today, we’re announcing ways to make finding and managing certain settings easier across multiple apps. These improvements can all be found in Accounts Center, which is located in the settings menus for Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. Things like Personal details, Passwords and security, and Ad preferences will now live in a centralized place, so it’ll be easier for people who use multiple apps to manage their settings. For example, you can now easily make your ad topic preferences consistent for Facebook and Instagram accounts by adding those accounts to the same Accounts Center. Learn more about the settings that are moving into Accounts Center. In addition to bringing Ad preferences to Accounts Center, we’re also making improvements to some of the ad settings controls that can help people understand and manage their ads experience across our technologies. First, we’re updating our Data about your activity from Partners’ control, which is now called Activity information from ad partners to help people easily understand how their activity sent from other websites and apps is used to power the ads they see. Second, we’re making it easier for people to understand their options when it comes to seeing ads shown by Meta on other apps and websites. Finally, we know people want more control over the ads they see, which is why we’re exploring new ways to give people the ability to see more ads about the things that interest them, in addition to the existing option of seeing fewer ads about things that don’t interest them. Adding more than one account to the same Accounts Center is optional — if you want to keep your accounts in separate Accounts Centers, you can. For people who choose to do so, they will still have access to the same settings, and can apply them to individual accounts. These changes will begin to go into effect today, and will gradually roll out to everyone on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram in the coming months. We’re also continuing to look for opportunities to centralize additional settings in Accounts Center going forward, so that people can more easily manage their preferences across our products."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/leading-the-fight-against-scraping-for-hire/","date":"2023-01-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta"],"title":"Leading the Fight Against Scraping-for-Hire","text":"Today, Meta is fighting back against a scraping-for-hire service and filed a legal action against Voyager Labs in federal court in California. Voyager Labs is a scraping and surveillance service that improperly collected data from Facebook, Instagram and other websites. We disabled Voyager’s accounts, filed this action to enforce our Terms and Policies and asked the Court to ban Voyager from Facebook and Instagram. Voyager developed and used proprietary software to launch scraping campaigns against Facebook and Instagram, and websites such as Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn and Telegram. Voyager designed its scraping software to use fake accounts to scrape data accessible to a user when logged into Facebook, including users profile information, posts, friends lists, photos and comments. Voyager used a diverse system of computers and networks in different countries to hide its activity, including when Meta subjected the fake accounts to verifications or checks. Voyager did not compromise Facebook, instead it used fake accounts to scrape publicly viewable information. Our lawsuit alleges that Voyager has violated our Terms of Service against fake accounts and unauthorized and automated scraping. We are seeking a permanent injunction against Voyager to protect people against scraping-for-hire services. Companies like Voyager are part of an industry that provides scraping services to anyone regardless of the users they target and for what purpose, including as a way to profile people for criminal behavior. This industry covertly collects information that people share with their community, family and friends, without oversight or accountability, and in a way that may implicate people’s civil rights. These services operate across many platforms and national boundaries, and require a collective effort from platforms, policymakers and civil society to deter the abuse of these capabilities.

We recognize that teens aren’t necessarily as equipped as adults to make decisions about how their online data is used for advertising, particularly when it comes to showing them products available to purchase. For that reason, we’re further restricting the options advertisers have to reach teens, as well as the information we use to show ads to teens. We’re also introducing more teen-specific controls and resources to help them understand how ads work and the reasons why they see certain ads on our apps. These changes reflect research, direct feedback from parents and child developmental experts, UN children’s rights principles and global regulation. The Changes We’re Making Previously, we made changes to how advertisers can reach teens, which included removing the ability for advertisers to target teens based on their interest and activities. We’re announcing further updates to our ad system beginning in February, including removing gender as an option for advertisers to reach teens. Additionally, their engagement on our apps — like following certain Instagram posts or Facebook pages — won’t inform the types of ads they see. Age and location will be the only information about a teen that we’ll use to show them ads. Age and location help us continue to ensure teens see ads that are meant for their age and products and services available where they live. Giving Teens More Control Starting in March, teens will have more ways to manage the types of ads they see on Facebook and Instagram with Ad Topic Controls, expanding on what’s already available. Teens will be able to go to their Ad Preferences within Settings on both apps, and choose See Less or No Preference to further control the types of ads they see. Our Advertising Standards already prohibit ads about restricted topics — like alcohol, financial products and weight loss products and services — to be shown to people under 18 (and older in certain countries). But even when an ad complies with our policies, teens may want to see fewer ads like it. For example, if a teen wants to see fewer ads about a genre of TV show or an upcoming sports season, they should be able to tell us that. Teens can continue to choose to hide any or all ads from a specific advertiser. The topics we already restrict in our policies will be defaulted to See Less, so that teens can’t choose to opt into content that may not be age-appropriate. Helping Teens Understand Their Privacy Options We’ve added a new privacy page with more information for teens about the tools and privacy settings they can use across our technologies, and our teen privacy center has additional resources to help teens understand and manage their privacy across our apps.

We know account security and recovery are top of mind for people, so today we are sharing a behind-the-scenes look at some of the tensions that companies like ours navigate in designing account security tools that help protect people while deterring bad actors. We’re also detailing new security features we’ve rolled out this year and highlighting why it’s critical for people to keep their contact points — like their email or phone numbers — secure and up to date to prevent one of the leading drivers of account compromise. Applying Adversarial Design to Account Security Since sharing our plans last year to expand our support efforts, we’ve continued to stress-test our account security and support systems to understand how bad actors might try to game them. This space is highly adversarial, which means we’re constantly thinking about how our products and our support channels may get abused; we have to keep evolving our defenses and processes in response to malicious actors trying to work around them. This is always a tricky balance because if we tighten account security controls too much, innocent people will have a harder time using and recovering their accounts. If we are too loose with controls, bad actors will have an easier time abusing our systems to compromise people. In fact, we regularly see threat actors target the very systems we put in place to protect people, trying to get accounts taken down. As an example of these types of controls in our account recovery support, we use a variety of signals and verification challenges to help detect suspicious activity and validate legitimate access attempts. These challenges may range from requesting a copy of a person’s ID or confirming a code sent to a device that has previously logged into the account. Taking a Closer Look at Contact Points Once an account recovery request is verified, platforms like ours rely on contact points — like an email address or phone number — listed in someone’s account’s settings as the primary channel to deliver support, like password reset links. Our research shows that people are two times more likely to recover their Facebook account if their contact points are up to date so we can reach them. However, people might lose access to an old email inbox or they may switch phone numbers — this is a challenge that is recognized across our industry. We’ve also seen threat actors target those contact points to gain broad access to someone’s online accounts by using it to reset the passwords for other connected accounts – banking, social media, and others. In fact, when looking at compromised Facebook accounts, we find that one in four began with a person’s contact point being taken over. Product and Support Updates Our work to help people stay safe and in control of their accounts is two-fold. First, to prevent account compromise, we build systems and help people learn how to identify potentially suspicious activity across the internet. Second, to help people who experience access issues, we continue to improve our support offerings. Contact Point Support We’ve built additional ways for people to get back into their accounts when they no longer have access to linked contact points. For instance, in certain cases, people can use recently removed contact points to recover access. As a result, this year we’ve helped eight times more people a day on average get back into their Facebook account than last year when they don’t have access to their listed contact points. We’re also running global in-app prompts across Facebook reminding people to confirm their contact points and exploring alternative ways to confirm people’s identity during the account recovery process on Instagram, including using their friend network. Phishing and Malware Protection To help people stay safe across our apps, we’re continuing to roll out protections and educational initiatives: Protections against malicious links: We know that threat actors often target groups like journalists, activists, political campaigns and businesses (among others) by sending them phishing links or malware. One measure we’ve rolled out to protect against this on Messenger uses our automated systems to direct suspicious messages if they are sent by unconnected users. As with many of our security measures, we’ll use our learnings to inform our broader strategy to protect people. Instagram imposter alerts: We remove Instagram accounts that our automated systems find to be malicious, including ones that impersonate others. But because bad actors may not immediately use accounts maliciously, we’re now testing sending warnings if an account that we suspect may be impersonating someone requests to follow them. In the coming months, we’ll also send warnings if an account that may be impersonating a business sends you a Direct Message. Increased Instagram verified badge visibility: We’re also expanding where the verified badge shows up on Instagram to make it visible in more places, including Stories and Direct Messages, to help people confirm that the accounts they’re interacting with are authentic and verified. Live Chat Support Test While our scaled account recovery tools aim at supporting the majority of account access issues, we know that there are groups of people that could benefit from additional, human-driven support. This year, we’ve carefully grown a small test of a live chat support feature on Facebook, and we’re beginning to see positive results. For example, during the month of October we offered our live chat support option to over a million people in nine countries and we’re now planning to expand this test to more than 30 countries around the world. Instagram Account Access Support We’ve launched instagram.com/hacked to help people to report and resolve account access issues. We’ve also rolled out a way for people to ask their friends to confirm their identity in order to help regain access to their Instagram account. We welcome feedback from the research community and our industry peers as we all navigate balancing these various tensions in protecting people and deterring bad actors."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/12/facebook-dating-age-verification/","date":"2022-12-04T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Bringing Age Verification to Facebook Dating","text":"We’re committed to making sure people have age-appropriate experiences across our technologies, and as part of this work, we’ve been testing age verification tools and using age detection technology to stop people under the age of 18 from accessing experiences meant for adults. Starting today, we’re expanding our age verification test to Facebook Dating in the US. We require people to be at least 18 years old in order to sign up for and access Facebook Dating, and age verification tools will help verify that only adults are using the service and help prevent minors from accessing it. We’re also continuing our partnership with Yoti, a company that specializes in online age verification, so that people have more than one option to choose from to verify their age. How Age Verification on Facebook Dating Works We want to make sure people are placed in experiences that are appropriate for their ages, so we use technology to understand where people have misrepresented how old they are. That’s why we’ve invested in age detection technology to find potential discrepancies in the ages people provide us and the age we think they may be based on our technology. If we detect someone may be under the age of 18 and trying to use Facebook Dating, we will prompt them to verify their age. They will have two options to choose from: Video Selfie: If you choose this option, you’ll see instructions on your screen to guide you through the process. After you take a video selfie, we share a still image from the video with Yoti and nothing else. Yoti’s technology estimates your age based on your facial features, shares that estimate with us and the image is then deleted immediately. The technology cannot recognize your identity — just your age.

ID Upload: You can also choose to upload a form of identification to verify your age. After you upload a copy of your ID, it’ll be encrypted and stored securely, and won’t be visible on your Facebook profile or to other people on the app. Once your age has been verified, you can manage how long your ID is saved for. Our Approach to Age Verification Providing people with more than one option to verify their age allows them to select a method that best fits their needs and preferences. For example, many people don’t always have access to the forms of ID that make verifying age clear. Our age verification tests show that our tools are working to help keep people within age-appropriate experiences. Since we began testing new age verification tools on Instagram in June, we’ve found that approximately four times as many people were more likely to complete our age verification requirements (when attempting to edit their date of birth from under 18 to over 18), equating to hundreds of thousands of people being placed in experiences appropriate for their age. We also were able to stop 96% of the teens who attempted to edit their birthdays from under 18 to 18 or over on Instagram from doing so. And we have found that 81% of people presented with our menu of options chose to use Yoti’s video selfie to verify their age. As we learn more, we plan to bring our age detection technology and verification tools to other countries globally where Facebook Dating is available, and to more experiences that require people to be over 18 to access them."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/12/sharing-poetry-on-facebook-to-help-the-blind-community/","date":"2022-12-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Sharing Poetry on Facebook to Help the Blind Community","text":"After a difficult diagnosis, Dave S. turned fear into hope by sharing his poetry on Facebook as Dave Steele The Blind Poet.

They include: The Community Standards Enforcement Report The Adversarial Threat Report The Widely Viewed Content Report The Oversight Board Quarterly Update Biannual Transparency Report including: Government Requests for User Data Intellectual Property Internet Disruptions Content Restrictions Based on Local Law These reports are all available in the Transparency Center. Here are the key highlights from each one: Community Standards Enforcement Report Highlights While our integrity efforts are always evolving, our goal is to reduce the violating content people see while making fewer mistakes. This means ensuring we take action on content that violates our policies while being more accurate and detecting nuance so that we aren’t taking down things incorrectly, like jokes between friends. Our actions against hate speech-related content decreased from 13.5 million to 10.6 million in Q3 2022 on Facebook because we improved the accuracy of our AI technology. We’ve done this by leveraging data from past user appeals to identify posts that could have been removed by mistake without appropriate cultural context. For example, now we can better recognize humorous terms of endearment used between friends, or better detect words that may be considered offensive or inappropriate in one context but not another. As we improved this accuracy, our proactive detection rate for hate speech also decreased from 95.6% to 90.2% in Q3 2022. Similarly, our actions against content that incites violence decreased from 19.3 million to 14.4 million in Q3 2022 after our improved AI technology was able to better recognize language and emojis used in jest between friends. As we improved our accuracy on this front, our proactive rate for actioning this content decreased from 98.2% to 94.3% in Q3 2022. For bullying and harassment-related content, our proactive rate decreased in Q3 2022 from 76.7% to 67.8% on Facebook, and 87.4% to 84.3% on Instagram. This decrease was due to improved accuracy in our technologies (and a bug in our system that is now resolved). Although our proactive rate dropped in a few areas, prevalence of harmful content on Facebook and Instagram remained relatively consistent between Q2 and Q3. We anticipate continued movement in these areas as our AI improves. On Facebook in Q3, we took action on: 16.7 million pieces of content related to terrorism, an increase from 13.5 million in Q2. This increase was because non-violating videos were added incorrectly to our media-matching technology banks and were removed (though they were eventually restored). 4.1 million pieces of drug content, an increase from 3.9 million in Q2 2022, due to improvements made to our proactive detection technology.n 1.4 billion pieces of spam content, an increase from 734 million in Q2, due to an increased number of adversarial spam incidents in August. On Instagram in Q3, we took action on: 2.2 million pieces of content related to terrorism, from 1.9 million in Q2, due to non-violating videos added incorrectly to our media-matching technology banks and were removed (though they were eventually restored). 2.5 million pieces of drug content, an increase from 1.9 million, due to improvements in our proactive detection technology. Adversarial Threat Report As part of our regular reporting, we’re sharing our third Adversarial Threat Report to provide a qualitative view into the adversarial threats we tackle globally. Last quarter, we investigated and took down three separate covert influence operations in the United States, China and Russia for violating our policy against coordinated inauthentic behavior. Two of these networks (China and Russia) were originally reported on September 27, 2022. Read the full report.

Working with External Experts Our transparency reports allow the public to hold us accountable and help us improve how we talk about our work. We are also committed to undertaking and releasing independent, third-party assessments for our processes, policies and metrics. Earlier this year, we released an EY assessment of our Community Standards Enforcement Report, which concluded that the calculation of the metrics in the report were fairly stated, and that our internal controls are suitably designed and operating effectively. We are also committed to independent oversight and support the Media Rating Council (MRC) as the auditor of our monetized solutions in advertising. Earlier this month, we announced that we received accreditation from the MRC for content-level Brand Safety on Facebook. This quarter, we updated and expanded the section of the Transparency Center on how we engage with stakeholders, including new examples of how their feedback has contributed to the development of our content policies. An Update on Governance The Oversight Board continues to be a valuable source of external perspective and accountability for Meta. The Board’s recommendations help us with our approach to content moderation by driving thoughtful improvements to our policies, operations and products. We respond to every recommendation publicly and have committed to implement or explore the feasibility of implementing 75 percent of those recommendations to date. We also recently announced a community forum taking place in December, which will bring together nearly 6,000 people from 32 countries to discuss conduct in the metaverse. Community forums bring together diverse groups of people to discuss tough issues, consider hard choices and share their perspectives on a set of recommendations. Initiatives like this are part of how we’re exploring new forms of governance, not only to help decentralize decision-making, but also include diverse perspectives in the process."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/protecting-teens-and-their-privacy-on-facebook-and-instagram/","date":"2022-11-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Protecting Teens and Their Privacy on Facebook and Instagram","text":"Today, we’re sharing an update on how we protect young people from harm and seek to create safe, age-appropriate experiences for teens on Facebook and Instagram. Updates to Limiting Unwanted Interactions Last year, we shared some of the measures we take to protect teens from interacting with potentially suspicious adults. For example, we restrict adults from messaging teens they aren’t connected to or from seeing teens in their People You May Know recommendations. In addition to our existing measures, we’re now testing ways to protect teens from messaging suspicious adults they aren’t connected to, and we won’t show them in teens’ People You May Know recommendations. A “suspicious” account is one that belongs to an adult that may have recently been blocked or reported by a young person, for example. As an extra layer of protection, we’re also testing removing the message button on teens’ Instagram accounts when they’re viewed by suspicious adults altogether. Encouraging Teens to Use Our Safety Tools We’ve developed a number of tools so teens can let us know if something makes them feel uncomfortable while using our apps, and we’re introducing new notifications that encourage them to use these tools. For example, we’re prompting teens to report accounts to us after they block someone, and sending them safety notices with information on how to navigate inappropriate messages from adults. In just one month in 2021, more than 100 million people saw safety notices on Messenger. We’ve also made it easier for people to find our reporting tools and, as a result, we saw more than a 70% increase in reports sent to us by minors in Q1 2022 versus the previous quarter on Messenger and Instagram DMs. New Privacy Defaults for Teens on Facebook Starting today, everyone who is under the age of 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into more private settings when they join Facebook, and we’ll encourage teens already on the app to choose these more private settings for: Who can see their friends list Who can see the people, Pages and lists they follow Who can see posts they’re tagged in on their profile Reviewing posts they’re tagged in before the post appears on their profile Who is allowed to comment on their public posts This move comes on the heels of us rolling out similar privacy defaults for teens on Instagram and aligns with our safety-by-design and ‘Best Interests of the Child’ framework. New Tools to Stop the Spread of Teens’ Intimate Images We’re also sharing an update on the work we’re doing to stop the spread of teens’ intimate images online, particularly when these images are used to exploit them — commonly known as “sextortion.” The non-consensual sharing of intimate images can be extremely traumatic and we want to do all we can to discourage teens from sharing these images on our apps in the first place. We’re working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to build a global platform for teens who are worried intimate images they created might be shared on public online platforms without their consent. This platform will be similar to work we have done to prevent the non-consensual sharing of intimate images for adults. It will allow us to help prevent a teen’s intimate images from being posted online and can be used by other companies across the tech industry. We’ve been working closely with NCMEC, experts, academics, parents and victim advocates globally to help develop the platform and ensure it responds to the needs of teens so they can regain control of their content in these horrific situations. We’ll have more to share on this new resource in the coming weeks. We’re also working with Thorn and their NoFiltr brand to create educational materials that reduce the shame and stigma surrounding intimate images, and empower teens to seek help and take back control if they’ve shared them or are experiencing sextortion. We found that more than 75% of people that we reported to NCMEC for sharing child exploitative content shared the content out of outrage, poor humor, or disgust, and with no apparent intention of harm. Sharing this content violates our policies, regardless of intent. We’re planning to launch a new PSA campaign that encourages people to stop and think before resharing those images online and to report them to us instead. Anyone seeking support and information related to sextortion can visit our education and awareness resources, including the Stop Sextortion hub on the Facebook Safety Center, developed with Thorn. We also have our guide for parents on how to talk to their teens about intimate images on the Education hub of our Family Center."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/protecting-footballers-and-fans-during-the-fifa-world-cup/","date":"2022-11-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Product News","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Protecting Footballers and Fans on Our Apps During the FIFA World Cup","text":"Over the next month, football fans across the globe will use our apps to connect around the FIFA World Cup. While most will be rooting for the teams and players competing for the championship, unfortunately there will likely be some who want to be abusive towards others — just like we see offline. Before the competition kicks off, we’re sharing more details about our policies against abuse, and the range of tools we’ve developed to help keep footballers — and everyone else — safe. Our Rules Against Abuse We have clear rules against bullying, violent threats and hate speech — and we don’t want it on our apps. As well as responding to reports from our community, outside of private messages we also use technology to proactively look for content that might break these rules. Where our technology thinks a piece of content may be violating it will take action, whether that’s sending it to our teams for review or — if it’s really confident — deleting it automatically. Between April and June this year, we took action on more than 17 million pieces of hate speech on Facebook and Instagram, and found more than 90% of that before anyone reported it. Features to Help Keep Footballers Safe In response to feedback from our community, we’ve developed new features — and updated existing ones — to help footballers and fans alike stay safe on our apps and protect them from abuse. People can turn direct message (DM) requests off completely on Instagram, meaning they won’t receive messages from anyone they don’t follow. They can also choose who can comment on their posts or turn off comments altogether, on a post-by-post basis. But some public figures have told us they don’t want to turn off DM requests completely, because they like hearing from fans and other members of their community. That’s why we developed Hidden Words. When turned on, this feature automatically sends DM requests — including Story replies — containing offensive words, phrases and emojis to a hidden folder so you don’t have to see them. It also hides comments with these terms under your posts. Since launching Hidden Words last year, more than one in five people with more than 10,000 followers have turned it on. We’re also testing turning it on by default for people with creator accounts, which includes many footballers playing in the World Cup. We launched Limits last year, which, when turned on, hides comments and DM requests from people who don’t follow you or who only followed you recently. Limits is particularly useful for public figures who experience sudden spikes of comments and DMs — after a football game, for example — as our research shows that most negativity towards them comes from non-followers or recent followers. When we detect that someone may be experiencing a rush of comments or DM requests, we’ll prompt them to turn on Limits. Blocking is a quick and effective way to stop someone from interacting with you. Now when you block someone on Instagram, you can also block any other accounts they may already have, or may create in the future, making it even harder for them to contact you. Encouraging More Supportive Behavior on Instagram We’re also continuing to explore ways to prevent people from posting abusive content in the first place. We already use artificial intelligence to detect when someone is trying to post a comment that might be offensive, and warn them it may break our rules. In a given week, people edit or delete their comment 50% of the time after seeing these warnings. We also recently introduced new nudges that encourage people to pause and rethink before replying to a potentially offensive comment. These nudges are live now for people whose apps are set to English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Chinese or Arabic. When people send a DM request to a creator or public figure for the first time, we’ll remind them to be respectful, so they remember there’s a real person on the other side of their message. Educating Footballers About Our Safety Tools and Policies We regularly speak to football players, teams and associations around the world — including FIFA — to make sure they know about our latest safety policies and features, and we listen carefully to their feedback. We’re also working closely with teams competing in the World Cup to help their players turn on our safety tools — for example Hidden Words — and we’re reminding footballers in the tournament to check them with a prompt at the top of their Instagram Feed. Working With Law Enforcement We cooperate with law enforcement in their investigations and respond to valid legal requests for information in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. As with all law enforcement requests, we’ll push back if they’re too broad, inconsistent with human rights or not legally valid. While we know no one thing will fix abusive behavior, we’re committed to continuing to develop tools to protect our community, and to working closely with the football industry to help keep our apps a safe place for footballers and fans."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/metas-progress-on-combating-climate-change/","date":"2022-11-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Meta","Sustainability"],"title":"Sharing Our Progress on Combating Climate Change","text":"Update on November 11, 2022 at 8:00AM PT: Meta has become a founding member of the Asia Clean Energy Coalition, which will advocate for eliminating barriers to corporate renewable energy purchasing in Asia. Originally published on November 6, 2022 at 11:00PM PT: As leaders and experts convene in Egypt for COP27, we’re outlining progress on our climate commitments and announcing expanded tools to help our communities take action against climate change. Like previous years, we’re focusing on how we can leverage our technologies, apps and operational strategy to demonstrate our commitment to solutions. Responsible Operations Since 2020, we’ve achieved net zero greenhouse gas emissions for our global operations as they are now supported by 100% renewable energy. We’ve also set ambitious goals to achieve net zero value chain emissions and to restore more water than we consume in our global operations in 2030. Reducing our emissions and helping our suppliers to do the same is our top priority to reach our climate target. This year, we announced a new partnership with Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify and McKinsey Sustainability to launch Frontier, an advanced market commitment to help scale emerging carbon removal technologies that are crucial to tackling climate change. Elevating Authoritative Climate Information As evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have an essential role to play during global crises in connecting people to accurate information. That’s why we’ve built and expanded a number of tools to provide authoritative information about the realities of climate change. We’ve created a new page that explains our holistic approach to addressing climate content and misinformation on our apps. Our investment in the Climate Misinformation Grant Program is forging new partnerships and initiatives, and our Public Ad Library gives an extra layer of transparency into all climate ads. We’ve expanded the Climate Science Center and it’s now available in 165 countries. We’re also expanding Climate Inform Labels, a tool that adds links to Facebook posts about climate change and connects people with expert-backed information in the Climate Science Center. We’ve launched a Climate InfoFinder tool that enables people to search for trusted information about climate change and link to this content directly in comment threads. We worked with partners to help launch our first Climate Science Literacy Initiative. Its goal is to pre-bunk climate misinformation by running ads across our products and apps that feature five of the most common techniques used to misrepresent climate change. Empowering Communities to Take Action After our largest-ever global survey about climate change this past spring painted a picture of deep concern among respondents, we have seen meaningful change happen when communities come together. More than 40 million people around the world are part of at least one of the 24,000 Facebook Groups dedicated to the discovery, protection and appreciation of the earth and our environment. We’re testing a new feature in Facebook Groups, called Climate Pledges, which leverages the power of communities to enable climate action. Developed with inputs from the UN Environment Programme and UN’s ActNow, the Climate Pledges feature contains expert-backed climate solutions to spark conversation and help people understand the most impactful actions they can take. Group admins can choose the solutions most relevant to their communities, invite group members to join, provide support and offer tips to keep everyone accountable. For example, a solar panel group admin may choose to activate the “Switch to renewable energy” pledge and group members commit to joining it together. Group members can also discover relevant content, including Reels, from across Facebook which they can then localize to their communities. Helping Equip Our Partners With Resources Our Boost Guide to Green Program has reached 1.3 million small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) on how to become greener. We released a new report in October, in partnership with Accenture, which explores the relationship between SMBs and climate action, and how digital technology can support them. Our Data for Good program also provided data from our small business surveys to the World Trade Organization, which published a report on small businesses’ experiences and challenges related to climate change. We also launched the Climate Perceptions Index, developed by the Social Progress Imperative, using data from our 2022 Climate Change Opinion Survey. It offers information on the societal implications of climate change with new data on people’s awareness of climate change, their perception of its risks and their commitment to climate action. Finally, we have collaborated with the World Resources Institute on prevention campaigns to reduce food waste, reaching more than 40 million people in Germany and the UK. We’ll use the insights we gain from these campaigns to inform future work."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/new-creators-tools-facebook-and-instagram/","date":"2022-11-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News"],"title":"Introducing New Tools for Creators to Build Businesses on Facebook and Instagram","text":"At Meta, we’re building products to help creators reach an audience, grow their communities and earn a living. During Creator Week 2022, we’re inviting creators around the world to join us in growing their careers, connecting with peers and building a future together. We’re also announcing new ways creators can earn money on Facebook and Instagram. Updates to Digital Collectibles Creators will soon be able to make their own digital collectibles on Instagram and sell them to fans, both on and off Instagram. They’ll have an end-to-end toolkit — from creation (starting on the Polygon blockchain) and showcasing, to selling. People can easily support their favorite creators by buying their digital collectibles directly within Instagram. We’re testing these new features with a small group of creators in the US first, and hope to expand to more countries soon. We’re also expanding the types of digital collectibles that you can showcase on Instagram to include video and adding support for the Solana blockchain and Phantom wallet, in addition to the blockchains and wallets that we already support. Lastly, information for select collections where the metadata has been enriched by OpenSea, such as collection name and descriptions, will now be available on Instagram. Audience Support for Creators We’re making it easier for people to show appreciation for their favorite creators across our apps, which helps creators strengthen their community and build their business. Subscriptions on Instagram We’re expanding access to subscriptions on Instagram to all eligible creators in the U.S., so more creators can earn predictable income and connect more deeply with their most engaged followers. Since launching subscriptions earlier this year, we’ve seen creators like Cole Sprouse (@colesprouse), Alan Chow (@alanchikinchow) and Skai Jackson (@skaijackson) use subscriptions to get even closer to their most engaged supporters. Stars and Gifts We are making it easier for people to discover Stars on Facebook by automatically enabling Stars on public creator content — including Reels. This means that people can learn about and use Stars in more places across Facebook. We are testing with a select number of creators globally. For creators already using Stars, we’re launching new features to make it easier to earn Stars and interact with Star senders: Bringing Stars Party to Reels. A Stars Party is a Stars community challenge that ends in a celebration if the creator reaches their goal. Testing a new set of virtual gifts tailored to specific content. For example, if you’re watching a puppy reel from your favorite pet creator, you’ll be able to send that creator a dog-themed gift. Giving creators more tools to engage with Stars senders, like adding a filter in Comments Manager that displays all of a creator’s Stars comments in one place. In this surface, creators will be able to reply to multiple comments at once. Bringing Stars to non-video public content like photos and text posts. We’re introducing gifts on Instagram, starting with Reels, so creators have a new way to earn money from fans who love their Reels. To support their favorite creators, fans can send gifts on Reels by purchasing Stars within Instagram. We’re testing this with a small group of creators in the US first, and hope to expand to more creators soon. Professional Mode for Facebook Profiles We’re launching professional mode for Facebook profiles, a new profile setting that allows creators around the world to build a public presence while maintaining their personal Facebook experience. Professional mode offers creators, and anyone that wants to become a creator, a set of tools and opportunities to begin growing a global community from their personal profile. With professional mode, creators can become eligible to earn money through Stars, ads on Facebook Reels, in-stream ads and Reels Play. They will also have access to content and audience analytics, educational resources and more."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/fundraise-for-nonprofits-giving-season/","date":"2022-10-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"New Way to Support Nonprofits This Giving Season","text":"Today we’re announcing a new way of matching donations this giving season that helps organizations raise money long-term.

Over 80% of donations this year were from fundraisers created by people and shared with their friends and family, and is the #1 way that people donate on Facebook. The data above shows our community’s journey to raising $7B for nonprofits, and identifies the top fundraisers per year, based on donation amount. The all-time top fundraisers since 2015, ranked by donation amount. On Facebook, the fundraisers with the most dollars raised in 2022 were related to Ukraine relief, Ramadan and animal protection. On Instagram, the fundraisers with the most donations this year were related to Ukraine relief, gun safety and the floods in Pakistan. One example is from Clare Staples, who founded the nonprofit Skydog Sanctuary to reunite horses that have been separated and also rescue wild mustangs and burros. She uses Facebook and Instagram to help raise the money she needs to care for the horses, find volunteers and share uplifting stories. Our technologies help organizations like Clare’s nonprofit connect directly with its large community of supporters."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/facebook-communities-summit-2022/","date":"2022-10-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing New Features to Facebook Groups","text":"Building community is core to Facebook’s mission in bringing the world closer together, and while community has made its way into every corner of the app, Groups continue to be the central place where people go to do more together. In fact, most people on Facebook are members of at least 15 active groups, and there are more than 100 million group joins every day. Today, we’re hosting the Facebook Communities Summit for the sixth year, announcing a number of changes to help people engage more deeply around the things they care about, strengthen community culture, and make it easier for admins to manage their groups. New Ways to Engage More Deeply With Your Communities As people come to Facebook to discover content and communities, we’re adding more ways to connect over shared interests. Reels in Groups let you express your voice in your communities through creative and immersive videos. With Reels now in Groups, community members can share information, tell stories and connect on a deeper level. Imagine people in a makeup-obsessed group sharing their latest techniques and beauty finds with fellow members. Group admins and members can also add creative elements such as audio, text overlay and filters on top of their videos before sharing to bring their stories to life. The ability to share a public Facebook event for your community to your Instagram story. Whether you’re a group admin hosting a meet-up to celebrate a community milestone, or a group member sharing your passion with friends, this feature can help you showcase your community more broadly. We’re testing updates to your Group profile to make it easier to foster community relationships and connect with other members. With these new updates you can: Customize the information in your About Me section to highlight information you want to share with your community. This can help both admins and members learn more about one another and create content that best reflects the group’s interests. Add an indicator to your profile if you’re open to messaging. This can help other like-minded members know that you’re willing to connect over shared interests. Earlier this year, we announced that admins can begin to create channels as a way to connect with their groups in smaller, more casual settings. For example, Community Chats, which lets people connect in real time around the topics they care about via text, audio and video, is now available in more than 140 countries globally. Black Girls Culinary, a Facebook group where people share their latest recipes, uses Community Chats to create chat channels for a topic like Meatless Mondays and audio channels to talk through cooking tips in real time. They can also seamlessly add an event chat to Group events, allowing people to discuss events before, during, and after they take place. We’re also testing the ability for group admins and moderators to create view-only chats to send one-way communications to all of their members without having to actively maintain or respond to messages in the chat, so they can stay up-to-date on important group information. Admins and moderators can also use an admin-only chat for in-the-moment collaboration. Admin-Curated Experiences to Build Culture Admins have new tools to help them effectively manage and drive their group’s culture forward in engaging, useful and responsible ways: Community Contributions: We’re testing a new way for admins to highlight top contributing members, who can earn points by taking on an active role with a set of responsibilities in the community or for receiving reactions and comments on posts. For example, gaming communities can identify helpful tips that other members share about new features, games and characters. By accruing points, top contributing members will earn badges to feature on their group profiles, making it easier for admins to select members for roles. Socializer: We’re testing a new role for admins to recognize active members who help others feel welcomed, connected and motivated to contribute in a community. For instance, Socializers in music festival communities can be recognized for sharing their festival experiences and motivating others to do the same by sharing photos and videos. Admin Assist: We’re sharing new updates on this feature, which helps admins efficiently moderate their groups by automatically taking action based on specific criteria they set: New treatments for false information: To help ensure content is more reliable for the broader community, group admins can automatically move posts containing information rated as false by third-party fact-checkers (whether the posts are identified as containing false information before or after being posted in their group) to pending posts so that the admins can review the posts before deleting them. Learn more about our third-party fact-checking program here. Daily Digest: Group admins can easily review how Admin Assist helps them manage their community with a new daily summary of actions taken in a community based on the criteria admins have set. Flagged by Facebook: As we shared in our recent Community Standards Enforcement Report, we’re testing an extension within Flagged by Facebook that gives some admins of eligible groups the ability to use additional context and allow some content that might otherwise be flagged for removal as bullying and harassment. We use a variety of criteria to define a group’s eligibility for this feature, including that the group admin must not have been the admin of a group we’ve previously removed. Through this test, an admin for a group of fish tank enthusiasts could allow a flagged comment that called a fish “fatty,” which was not intended to be offensive. We still require groups to follow our policies and will remove violating content that’s reported to us. Community Accelerator Program The 2022 Community Accelerator Program provides community leaders with four months of training, mentorship and funding to help them deepen their community’s impact through Meta technologies. Today, we’re announcing this year’s selected participants from around the globe."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/creating-an-emotional-support-community-on-facebook/","date":"2022-10-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Creating an Emotional Support Community on Facebook","text":"After sharing his thoughts on Facebook about feeling lonely, Martin N. realized others needed an outlet too.

We’ve shared our findings with industry peers, security researchers and policymakers to help us improve our collective defenses against this threat. Most importantly, because these apps were accessible in third-party app stores, we’re encouraging people to be cautious when downloading a new app that asks for social media credentials and providing practical steps to help people stay safe. What We’ve Found Our security researchers have found more than 400 malicious Android and iOS apps this year that were designed to steal Facebook login information and compromise people’s accounts. These apps were listed on the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store and disguised as photo editors, games, VPN services, business apps and other utilities to trick people into downloading them. Some examples include: Photo editors, including those that claim to allow you to “turn yourself into a cartoon” VPNs claiming to boost browsing speed or grant access to blocked content or websites Phone utilities such as flashlight apps that claim to brighten your phone’s flashlight Mobile games falsely promising high-quality 3D graphics Health and lifestyle apps such as horoscopes and fitness trackers Business or ad management apps claiming to provide hidden or unauthorized features not found in official apps by tech platforms. This is a highly adversarial space and while our industry peers work to detect and remove malicious software, some of these apps evade detection and make it onto legitimate app stores. We’ve reported these malicious apps to our peers at Apple and Google and they have been taken down from both app stores prior to this report’s publication. We are also alerting people who may have unknowingly self-compromised their accounts by downloading these apps and sharing their credentials, and are helping them to secure their accounts. How Do These Apps Work? Malicious developers create malware apps disguised as apps with fun or useful functionality — like cartoon image editors or music players — and publish them on mobile app stores. To cover up negative reviews by people who have spotted the defunct or malicious nature of the apps, developers may publish fake reviews to trick others into downloading the malware. When a person installs the malicious app, it may ask them to “Login With Facebook” before they are able to use its promised features. If they enter their credentials, the malware steals their username and password. If the login information is stolen, attackers could potentially gain full access to a person’s account and do things like message their friends or access private information. How You Can Stay Safe There are many legitimate apps that offer the features listed above or that may ask you to sign in with Facebook in a safe and secure way. Cybercriminals know how popular these types of apps are and use these themes to trick people and steal their accounts and information. Malware apps often have telltale signs that differentiate them from legitimate apps. Here are a few things to consider before logging into a mobile app with your Facebook account: Requiring social media credentials to use the app: Is the app unusable if you don’t provide your Facebook information? For example, be suspicious of a photo-editing app that needs your Facebook login and password before allowing you to use it. The app’s reputation: Is the app reputable? Look at its download count, ratings and reviews, including negative ones. Promised features: Does the app provide the functionality it says it will, either before or after logging in? Here are a few examples of malware apps we found to provide no functionality until you log in with your social media account. What to Do If You’re Affected If you believe you’ve downloaded a malicious app and have logged in with your social media or other online credentials, we recommend that you delete the app from your device immediately and follow the following instructions to secure your accounts: Reset and create new strong passwords. Never reuse your password across multiple websites. Enable two-factor authentication, preferably using an Authenticator app, to add an extra security layer to your account. Turn on log-in alerts so you’ll be notified if someone is trying to access your account. Be sure to review your previous sessions to ensure you recognize which devices have access to your account. We also encourage people to report malicious applications that compromise Meta accounts to us through our Data Abuse Bounty program.

Along with updates from your friends, Groups and Pages, Facebook recommends posts from creators and communities you may not know about for you to enjoy and discuss. What you see in your Feed is uniquely personalized to your interests through machine learning. Today, we’re announcing new ways to customize what you see in your Facebook Feed so you can discover what’s most relevant to you. Now, you can select Show more or Show less on posts from the people and communities you’re connected to and posts that Facebook recommends to you. Selecting Show more will temporarily increase the ranking score for that post and posts like it. If you select Show less, you’ll temporarily decrease its ranking score. By offering more ways to incorporate direct feedback into Feed ranking, we’re making our artificial intelligence systems smarter and more responsive. We’ll periodically show this on posts in Feed. Soon, you can choose to Show more or Show less on posts by tapping into the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner. We are also starting to test this feature in Reels. Additionally, we’re continuing to explore ways to help you customize how much content you see in Feed from the friends and family, Groups, Pages and public figures you’re connected to. These tools — as well as Favorites, snooze and reconnect— can be found in Feed Preferences. Features like these can help you discover more of the content that’s valuable to you, so you can see more of what you want and less of what you don’t. As with every product change we make, we’ll use direct feedback to continually refine our approach."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/accounts-center-facebook-and-instagram/","date":"2022-09-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Product News"],"title":"Making it Easier to Switch Between and Create New Accounts and Profiles on Facebook and Instagram","text":"Today, we’re introducing new features that will make it easier for people on Facebook and Instagram to access, create and navigate between multiple accounts and profiles. We know that many people use more than one of our apps to pursue different interests, reach a broader audience or share different aspects of who they are with different groups of people. With that in mind, we’re simplifying the process of creating and switching between accounts and profiles. Easily Switch Between Facebook and Instagram First, we’re introducing a new profile-switching interface that will make it easier to stay on top of notifications and navigate between Facebook and Instagram. People will be able to easily switch between their Facebook and Instagram profiles if they’ve added them to the same Accounts Center. Additionally, people can now see their Facebook and Instagram profiles in one place. Notifications will also be conveniently displayed for each profile, making it easier to stay up to date on activity across Facebook and Instagram. We’re testing this new experience globally on iOS, Android and web. Quickly Create New Accounts and Profiles We’re also introducing a new account registration and login flow that will enable people to more easily log in and create new accounts across Facebook and Instagram. People new to our products can create a Facebook or Instagram account, and then use that account to sign up for additional ones. And people who have both a Facebook and an Instagram account can now easily use login information from one app to access the other, as long as their accounts are in the same Accounts Center. We’re testing this new experience globally on iOS and Android. Building With Safety in Mind Each of these new features uses the Meta brand to make it clear and easy to understand that you are interacting with a feature that works across more than one Meta technology, and to make the process as streamlined as possible. As always, account security and privacy are top of mind for us, and existing security features will still apply to the updates we are announcing today. For example, if someone turns on two-factor authentication for their Facebook account, then an unrecognized device can’t log into their Facebook account with their Instagram login information. Additionally, people will be notified when a new account is created using their existing account and when an account is added to their Accounts Center, so you can confidently stay up to date on activity across all of your accounts. Finally, people can manage which profile appears in the profile-switching experience, and which accounts can log into each other. While these changes are currently limited to Facebook and Instagram, we’ll continue to explore how to improve cross-app features across all of our technologies."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/womens-health-on-facebook/","date":"2022-09-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Creating a Safe Space to Learn About Women’s Health on Facebook","text":"Victoria M. wanted a safe place to learn more about women’s health, so she created Copa Menstrual México Facebook Group.

Today, Mark Zuckerberg announced we’ll begin testing the ability for people to start Community Chats in Messenger in the coming weeks, allowing people to create a Facebook Group, start chats and audio channels, and invite others to join their new group all within the app. We’ll also be expanding Community Chats to even more Facebook Groups. Why Community Chats? Community Chats let people connect more deeply with communities in real time around the topics they care about in multiple formats, including text, audio and video. The experience seamlessly blends Messenger and Facebook Groups to allow people to connect when, where and how they want. Admins can now start a conversation about a topic and get in-the-moment responses instead of waiting for people to comment on a post. And, rather than navigating multiple topics in a single Messenger group chat, the person who creates the Community Chat can organize chats into categories so group members can easily find what’s most interesting to them. For example, a band’s fan group could have a “Breaking News” category with chats dedicated to new album drops, tour dates and group activities. How It Works Check out how Vanessa Yaeger, admin of the Women Who Surf Facebook Group, uses Community Chats to bring her members together in real time for a spontaneous IRL meetup.

Admins can choose from several options to help their communities connect. They can start a chat for group members around a specific topic, an event chat for an outing or meetup, a view-only broadcast chat for admins to announce group-wide updates and an admin-only chat to collaborate with admins and moderators. Admins can also create audio channels so group members can share live commentary or receive real-time support. Participants also have the option to enable video once they’re in the audio channel. For example, the admin of a Facebook Group for chemistry students could create audio channels for study groups during finals season, and participants can turn on video for live tutoring. Community Chats are only accessible to members of a group. To learn more about how to use Community Chats, check out the Facebook Community Blog. Given the more public nature of Community Chats, we’ve developed a robust suite of tools to help admins easily manage both chat and audio experiences. This includes moderation capabilities like blocking, muting or suspending group members, and removing members or messages, as well as Admin Assist, which allows admins to set custom criteria that will automatically suspend users, remove reported messages, and stop messages from ineligible authors or containing violating content from being sent. Members of Community Chats can also report messages to group admins or Meta, block users or leave a chat at any time. Learn more about privacy and safety controls in Community Chats. What’s Next We’re committed to building messaging experiences that help people connect with their communities, friends and families. As Community Chats rolls out to more people and groups around the world, we’ll continue exploring new features and capabilities to make it easier to connect with one another."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/safety-and-privacy-in-community-chats/","date":"2022-09-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Messenger","Meta"],"title":"How We Approach Safety and Privacy in Community Chats","text":"Community Chats in Messenger and Facebook allow people to connect more deeply with communities in real time around the topics they care about via text, audio or video. Messenger already helps more than a billion people stay connected to friends and family, and this feature helps people also connect with communities over shared interests. Since they’re designed for more public conversations, we’re explaining our approach to making Community Chats trusted spaces. Empowering Admins, Moderators and Members Admins and moderators can manage their Community Chats with a robust suite of content and moderation tools to help keep people safe. Admin Assist allows them to set custom criteria that will automatically suspend users, remove reported messages and stop messages from ineligible authors or containing violating content from being sent. They can also manually delete messages, remove group members from chats and report messages to Meta. Members of Community Chats can report a group, category, chat or message, and they can block people or leave a chat at any time. People who are blocked or removed from a group won’t be able to view its Community Chat content. If someone joins a chat with a person they’ve blocked on Facebook, they will be able to see that person’s content but will receive a pop-up notice that the person they’ve blocked is present. Audio channels in Community Chats will follow the same standards as other Messenger audio calls, providing people with controls to manage their experience. This includes the ability to block or remove someone, and to report an audio channel or participant to both Facebook or an admin. Protecting Your Privacy We know people will want to understand how they can protect their privacy, and it’s important to understand how and when you will be visible in a Community Chat. Any member of a Facebook Group can join its Community Chats and see their history, with the exception of admin-only or invite-only chats. Private conversations should be reserved for private Messenger chats. We will continue to respect your existing privacy settings in Community Chats, and private accounts will work the same way they do today. For example, your account’s name and basic profile information will be visible to other members of a Community Chat, but Feed content by private accounts will be visible only to friends or followers. If a member of a Community Chat sends you a private message on Messenger, those messages will adhere to your message delivery controls, which means you can decide whether the request is sent to your chats list, your message requests folder or whether you want to receive it at all. Finally, as with other parts of Meta, we collect information from Messenger and Facebook primarily to provide the service, improve the product experience and keep people safe and secure. We’re always improving our data collection processes, as well as carefully monitoring and verifying how we use data. Learn more about how we collect and use information from Messenger and Facebook. Keeping Communities Safe How we treat content and data in Community Chats is different from that of private messaging in Messenger. Given their more public nature, we use machine learning to detect and remove a wider breadth of potentially harmful content than in private Messenger chats, and we do not currently allow message forwarding from Community Chats. While all chats are subject to Facebook’s Community Standards, Community Chats are subject to these policies regardless of whether they’ve been reported. This means Facebook may automatically take down violating content or media, and repeated content violations could lead to a suspension of the feature, a Facebook Group or a user’s account. And, Facebook content shared in Community Chats that has been rated sensitive or misleading will be labeled as such so people can better decide what to read, trust or share. Learn more about our approach to content moderation and enforcement. An Ongoing Project We are excited by the opportunities that Community Chats will give people to interact and deepen relationships in their online communities. We know this is a work in progress, and we’re thinking carefully about the best ways to protect people and create the right tools to manage these communities. We’ll continue to consult with the people who use our products, as well as safety and policy experts, to build the best experience as we move forward."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/deterring-scraping-by-protecting-facebook-identifiers/","date":"2022-09-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Deterring Scraping By Protecting Facebook Identifiers","text":"As part of an ongoing series about addressing data misuse, we recently shared an update on how our External Data Misuse (EDM) team works to safeguard people against clone sites. Today, we’re detailing our approach on deterring scraping of Facebook Identifiers (FBIDs) on Facebook. What Is an Identifier? Most companies use unique identifiers within the URLs of their website. Identifiers are a way to uniquely reference people or content such as posts, pictures and videos. Within Facebook, these identifiers are known as FBIDs and we use them to load content for people. Scraping is the automated collection of data from a website or app and can be both authorized and unauthorized. Unauthorized scraping often involves guessing identifiers, or using purchased identifiers to scrape people’s data. In some cases, scrapers collect identifiers and cross-reference phone numbers or other publicly-available data to create reusable data sets that are sometimes sold for profit. We created Pseudonymized Facebook Identifiers (PFBIDs), which combine timestamps and FBIDs to generate a unique time-rotating identifier. As we phase out the ability to access the original identifiers, this helps deter unauthorized data scraping by making it harder for attackers to guess, connect and repeatedly access data. These identifiers are not designed to prevent browser tools from removing tracking components from the URL. We use this process to better protect people’s privacy from certain types of enumeration and time-delayed attacks while preserving the ability to have long-lived links. You can read additional updates and insights on our privacy initiatives on our Privacy Matters page."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/08/facebook-widely-viewed-content-report-q2-2022/","date":"2022-08-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Widely Viewed Content Report, Second Quarter 2022","text":"Today, we’re publishing the Widely Viewed Content Report (WVCR) for the second quarter of 2022. This report highlights the most-viewed organic content in Feed on Facebook in the US, including domains, links, Pages and posts. It includes content recommended by Facebook and excludes advertising content. See the full report and Companion Guide for more information. Updates and Enforcements This report shows five links and one post that we removed from Facebook for violating our Inauthentic Behavior (IB) policy. Content with links to the domains responsible for these violations can no longer be created/shared on Facebook. Similarly, the Page responsible for the post and its content are no longer accessible on Facebook for violating our Inauthentic Behavior policy We also note in this report that we’ve removed one of the top posts for violating our Intellectual Property policy. We removed it after receiving a complete copyright report for the content. Learn more about how we protect intellectual property rights. Insights from the WVCR help inform how we update our existing policies and products, and develop new ones to address harmful or otherwise objectionable content. For example, we’ve been testing new ways to reduce clickbait, engagement bait and spam. While we’re seeing improvements from these tests, we will need to continually evaluate and refine our approach given how spam operators try to adapt their tactics to evade our new ways of detecting them. We’ll continue to test and improve solutions to reduce engagement bait, misinformation and content from Pages that repeatedly violate our Community Standards. In Focus: Foreign Spammers Marketing to US Audiences In our previous WVCR report, we shared that the ninth-most viewed link on Facebook with over 33 million views in the first quarter of this year was alltrendytees[.]com. After the Integrity Institute had flagged it to us, we investigated and blocked this domain for violating our IB policy. Our investigation linked this domain to GearLaunch, a Bangladesh-based e-commerce firm. In total, we removed over 500 inauthentic and authentic accounts, Pages and Groups run by these spammers. We also blocked additional domains that engaged in the same behavior and were linked to GearLaunch. We will keep taking action against this activity because we know that adversarial actors like this may try to come back and create new websites. In addition to running fake accounts to spam people with links and drive them to off-platform domains selling print-on-demand t-shirts, they also engaged in what we call “guiding adversarial activity” where they facilitated and coached people on how to evade detection and enforcement. They generated “how-to” YouTube videos where they taught people how to deceptively build their audience while posing as Americans and monetize by selling topical t-shirts through their print-on-demand websites. T-shirt designs ranged from hobby-related images like fishing to professional areas like accounting to political slogans and images. This case continues the trend we’ve previously reported where IB operators pretend that they’re based in one country, when in reality, they’re running their monetization schemes out of a different one. This often includes foreign spammers and scammers flocking to any relevant everyday interests or hot-button issues that are relevant in a particular country or region — like an election or a socio-political crisis — to amass an audience and monetize their attention. For example, we’ve seen financially-motivated actors from around the world leverage significant events — like the Canadian trucker protests, the US 2020 elections, the war in Ukraine and the recent election in the Philippines — to build audiences and make money. We expect to see attempts at this kind of activity increase in the US as we get closer to the midterms. So we will stay vigilant to it and respond whenever we see it, while also fine tuning our detection and enforcement systems to make sure we stay ahead of it.

This update includes: The Community Standards Enforcement Report (CSER) for the second quarter of 2022; The Widely Viewed Content Report (WVCR) for the second quarter of 2022; The Oversight Board Quarterly Update for the second quarter of 2022; Updates on our work to protect safety and expression and New data on our third-party fact checker program. Earlier this month we also released our Quarterly Adversarial Threat Report, which provides an in-depth, qualitative view into the different types of adversarial threats we tackle globally as well as our approach to the upcoming elections in Brazil and the United States. Community Standards Enforcement Report Highlights We continue to make steady progress on a number of areas, including bullying and harassment. As we continue to improve our AI technology, the proactive detection rate of bullying and harassment content on Facebook increased from 67% in Q1 2022 to 76.8% in Q2 2022 and on Instagram from 83.8% in Q1 2022 to 87.4% in Q2 2022. On Facebook in Q2: Bullying and Harassment: Prevalence was 0.08-0.09%, from 0.09% in Q1. We took action on 8.2 million pieces of it in Q2, from 9.5 million in Q1. Hate Speech: Prevalence remained at 0.02% or two views per 10,000. We took action on 13.5 million pieces of it in Q2, from 15.1 million pieces in Q1. Violence and Incitement: Prevalence remained 0.03% or three views per 10,000. We took action on 19.3 million pieces of it in Q2, from 21.7 million pieces in Q1. On Instagram in Q2: Bullying and Harassment: Prevalence was 0.04-0.05%, from 0.05-0.06% in Q1. We took action on 6.1 million pieces of it, from seven million in Q1. Hate Speech: Prevalence was 0.01-0.02% or one to two views per 10,000, from 0.02% in Q1. We took action on 3.8 million pieces of it in Q2, from 3.4 million pieces in Q1. Violence and Incitement: Prevalence remained 0.01-0.02% or two views per 10,000. We took action on 3.7 million pieces of it in Q2, from 2.7 million pieces in Q1. As part of our work to constantly improve the metrics we share in this report, we have updated our appeals methodology to account for all instances where content was submitted for additional review, including times when people told us they disagreed with our decision. As new regulations continue to roll out around the globe, we are focused on the obligations they create for us and how those obligations might affect our ability to keep prevalence of violating content on our apps low, minimize enforcement mistakes and conduct sufficient due-diligence as part of our safety and security processes. Oversight Board Highlights Expansion of the Board’s Scope: The board will soon issue a new type of binding judgment on cases: whether or not we should apply a warning screen to some pieces of content. While the board has already been able to apply binding decisions on whether to take down or leave up pieces of content, this expansion will empower them further by giving them more input on how content appears and is distributed to people across our platforms. Newsworthiness: As a result of a recommendation from the Oversight Board, we’re releasing data on the number of newsworthy allowances we made over a calendar year. We’re committing to release these numbers on a regular basis moving forward. From June 2021 to June 2022, we documented 68 newsworthiness allowances, of which, 13 (~20%) of those were issued for posts by politicians. This data, along with examples of and details on these allowances, are now available in our Transparency Center. Crisis Policy Protocol: During crises, we assess on and off-platform risks of imminent harm and respond with specific policy and product actions. Based on a recommendation from the Oversight Board — and to strengthen our existing work — we are publishing our Crisis Policy Protocol (CPP) to codify our content policy response to crises. This framework helps to assess crisis situations that may require a new or unique policy response. The CPP guides our use of targeted crisis policy interventions in a timely manner that is consistent with observed risks and past interventions. As a result, this helps our crisis policy response to be more calibrated and sustainable, as we seek to balance a consistent global response with adapting to quickly changing conditions. Protocol development included original research, consultations with over 50 global external experts in national security, conflict prevention, hate speech, humanitarian response and human rights. Learn more here and here. Empowering Expression and Protecting Safety We are always refining our policies and enforcement so that we’re both supporting people’s ability to express themselves and protecting safety across our platforms. We know we don’t always get it right, and we’re looking into ways we can improve our proactive enforcement, like through applying AI technology. We found that using warning screens to discourage hate speech or bullying and harassment content prevented some of this content — which could have violated our community standards — from being posted. We’re also expanding a test of Flagged by Facebook, which allows some group admins to better shape their group culture and take context into account by keeping some content in their groups that might otherwise be flagged for bullying and harassment. For example, through this test an admin for a group of fish tank enthusiasts allowed a flagged comment that called a fish “fatty,” which was not intended to be offensive. Fact-Checking and Helpful Comments We have built the largest global fact-checking network of any platform, with more than 90 fact-checking partners around the world who review and rate viral misinformation. In Q2, we displayed warnings on over 200 million distinct pieces of content on Facebook (including re-shares) globally based on over 130,000 debunking articles written by our fact-checking partners. In the US, we partner with 10 fact-checking organizations, five of which cover content in Spanish. We’re adding TelevisaUnivision as another US partner to cover Spanish language content. We’ve also launched a pilot program on Facebook that aims to show people more reliable information and empower them to decide what to read, trust and share. A small group of our US third-party fact-checking partners has the ability to comment in English and Spanish to provide more information on public Facebook posts that they determine could benefit from more context. This effort is separate from our third-party fact-checking program. The comments aren’t fact-check ratings. They won’t result in any enforcement penalties for content owners, nor will they impact a post’s distribution or the overall status of a Page. Also, unlike fact-checks, these comments will appear on Facebook posts that may not be verifiably false but that people may find misleading."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/08/sharing-a-passion-for-the-outdoors-and-design-on-facebook/","date":"2022-08-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Sharing a Passion for the Outdoors and Design on Facebook","text":"Tara P. grew up with a deep love for the outdoors and always wanted to create a special outdoor space at home.

Chetty and his team at Harvard’s Opportunity Insights are known for their groundbreaking research on economic opportunity in the United States and how public policy can improve a person’s economic mobility. They have long speculated that people’s social connections play a large role in shaping the opportunities people have to find jobs, succeed in school or find help during a crisis. But they didn’t have access to the data necessary to explore their hypothesis. Together, Opportunity Insights and Meta embarked on a years-long research project that has culminated in two papers published today in the journal Nature. It also led to the creation of the Social Capital Atlas, new datasets and research insights that uses data from Facebook friendships to provide measures of social capital across ZIP codes, high schools and colleges in the United States. Meta is making this dataset available through our Data for Good program. We’ve also partnered with Opportunity Insights to build tools to easily visualize and download the data at socialcapital.org. This work is a major contribution to our understanding of the relationship between social connections and economic opportunity. And it shows how Meta’s data can be used for societally significant research when shared responsibly and in a way that protects people’s privacy. Chetty’s Opportunity Insights group and researchers at Harvard, New York University and Stanford partnered with Meta researchers to analyze privacy-protected data from US Facebook and Instagram users. They used a range of techniques to preserve people’s privacy, including methods like differential privacy and aggregation. The researchers found that social connections play an important role in helping people achieve economic mobility. Neighborhoods that foster more connections between low-income and high-income people tend to have higher levels of mobility. The research also highlights why it is crucial that policymakers take social factors and interventions into account when designing policies, such as the need for mentorship programs in under-resourced schools to complement financial support. The Social Capital Atlas provides data to better understand where such efforts would be most valuable. We hope to contribute to similar research projects around the world. For instance, our teams are beginning to explore research into the role of social capital in communities in the UK and deepen our understanding into the role of social connections in society worldwide. Sharing timely and relevant insights is a long-standing practice at Meta. For example, this project developed through work done by Meta’s New Product Experimentation (NPE) team to explore how data can be used to solve city and community problems. And our Data for Good team works to build and share privacy-protected maps, surveys and data insights that support the work of over 550 partners in over 70 countries around the world.

Music Revenue Sharing is available to creators in markets where music is available on Facebook. Originally published on July 25, 2022 at 8:00AM PT: Today, we’re introducing Music Revenue Sharing on Facebook, making it easier for creators to monetize their videos that use licensed music from popular and emerging artists like Post Malone, Tove Lo, Grupo La Cumbia, Leah Kate, Bicep and more. This gives both creators and music rights holders a new way to earn money from videos on Facebook. Music Revenue Sharing is powered by Rights Manager, a video, audio and image-matching tool we developed to help content owners protect their rights and manage their content at scale. In addition, this feature is made possible through our partnerships across the music industry; it’s the first of its kind at this scale, benefiting creators, our partners, music rights holders and fans. How It Works Creators can now earn money through certain videos that use licensed songs with Music Revenue Sharing — something they weren’t able to do previously. Creators must be eligible for in-stream ads in their content and meet our monetization eligibility standards in order to access Music Revenue Sharing. Video creators will receive 20% revenue share on eligible videos, with a separate share going to music rights holders and to Meta. Content must satisfy Facebook’s monetization policies, Community Standards and music guidelines. The video must be at least 60 seconds long and there must be a visual component in the video as well; the licensed music itself cannot be its primary purpose. More details and criteria for revenue sharing can be found in the Help Center. Music Revenue Sharing will start rolling out today to video creators globally. Eligible videos will monetize with in-stream ads delivered in the US to start, and we’ll expand to the rest of the world where music is available on Facebook in the coming months. You can find videos from creators you follow and new ones you may not follow yet in Facebook Watch and in Feed.

We’re also naming the primary tab — the first thing you see when you open the app — Home. Home is the starting point for connection, entertainment and discovery on Facebook.

Feeds: Keeping Up on the Latest We understand you may want more options when it comes to sorting and seeing your content. There are times you might know just what you’re looking for — say, the latest posts from your groups — or you may want to encounter fresh, entertaining content. As Home becomes more of a discovery engine for you to find and follow new content and creators through recommendations, the Feeds tab provides an easy way to access the content from the people and communities you’re already connected with on Facebook. There are no Suggested For You posts in Feeds and ads are included. Starting today, some people will see Feeds as a tab in their shortcut bar; on iOS, this bar is found at the bottom of the app, and on Android, it’s found at the top. We expect these updates to be rolled out globally over the next week. The tabs in the shortcut bar change based on the parts of the app you’re using the most. You can also personalize and pin a tab in your shortcut bar, making its placement permanent. Home: Where Discovery Happens We’re introducing the name Home for the tab you see when you first open the Facebook app. This is where you will discover new content through recommendations in addition to connecting with your friends and family. From Home, you can also create a Reel, see what your connections are sharing on Feed and in Stories, and build community over new and shared interests. Your Home tab is uniquely personalized to you through our machine learning ranking system. This system takes into account thousands of signals to help cut through the clutter and rank content in the order we think you will find most valuable. We’re investing in AI to best serve recommended content in this ranked experience. While Home is where you’ll increasingly find community through your passions and interests, you can continue to stay up-to-date on the people and communities you care about most in Feeds."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/first-annual-human-rights-report/","date":"2022-07-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta","WhatsApp"],"title":"A Closer Look: Meta’s First Annual Human Rights Report","text":"As we committed to doing, today we are releasing Meta’s first annual Human Rights Report, covering 2020 and 2021, which details how we’re addressing potential human rights concerns stemming from our products, policies or business practices. This report builds on the work we’ve done since 2018 of disclosing human rights impact assessments, as well as on a commitment we made in the Meta Human Rights Policy to report annually on our insights and actions from our human rights work. We’ve sought to ground the report, and our human rights work, in the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Inside the Report This report provides more details about our entire approach to managing human rights risks. While some areas of the report have been previously disclosed, many are new, such as the due diligence we performed in regard to COVID-19 and Ray-Ban Stories. The report’s structure follows the pillars of the Human Rights Policy. It is our first take at an in-depth human rights disclosure report — something done by a small but growing number of companies. Similar to how we report on our sustainability work each year, this report will serve as a regular annual disclosure on how we are addressing our human rights impacts that people can expect to see on a regular basis. It includes details about how we’ve updated our policies as part of an ongoing effort to take human rights considerations into account in an increasingly dynamic world, including: specifically referencing human rights principles; clarifying our health misinformation policies; enhancing our bullying and harassment policy to create stronger protections against gender-based harassment for everyone, including public figures; prohibiting certain mass harassment or brigading; expanding our policies that prohibit veiled and implicit threats, and more. The report explains how our Data Policy, our Law Enforcement Response Team and our due diligence assessments work together to protect people from unlawful or overbroad government surveillance. It highlights the important role that end-to-end encryption plays on WhatsApp in protecting people’s privacy — particularly journalists and human rights defenders — and how we’re expanding it to our other messaging apps. We show how we manage risks related to human trafficking and exploitation through in-product features that raise awareness, deter violating behavior and offer support to victims. We also note how our Community Standards and Community Guidelines address hate speech, how our advertising policies address non-discrimination, and how our dedicated Civil Rights and Human Rights teams worked across the company during the reporting period to help ensure responsible innovation and accessibility. Finally, the report discusses our work to increase teen safety on Instagram, our continuing work to fight child exploitation on WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram and the significant investments we’ve made in teams and technologies to better protect free and fair elections, including dedicated teams focused on election integrity and products that bring people relevant and reliable voting information. Looking Ahead We hope this report is read in the spirit we wrote it: as a genuine effort to tell the story of our evolving human rights risk management, disclose actions and insights with humility, and develop a strong practice from which to do more. We’re also launching a website today, available in several languages, to share more information on our human rights work. As we continue to look to future technologies and the metaverse ahead, we’ll stay focused on building in ways that are inclusive and empowering for everyone."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/meta-accounts-and-horizon-profiles-for-vr/","date":"2022-07-06T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Meta Quest","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Meta Accounts and Meta Horizon Profiles for VR","text":"Update August 23, 2022 at 9:00AM PT: Meta accounts and Meta Horizon profiles are now live. Learn more about how to get started with Meta accounts. Originally posted on July 7, 2022 at 9:00AM PT: Today, Mark Zuckerberg introduced Meta accounts: a new way for people to log into their VR headsets that doesn’t require a Facebook account. Starting in August 2022, if you’re new to Meta VR devices or have previously merged your Oculus account with your Facebook account, you’ll need to create a Meta account and Meta Horizon profile. If you’ve been logging into your VR device with your Oculus account, you can continue to do so until January 1, 2023, at which point you’ll need to create a Meta account and Meta Horizon profile to continue using your Meta VR device. Your Meta account is not a social media profile; it lets you log into your VR devices and view and manage your purchased apps in one place. In the future, we’ll extend Meta account functionality so you can use it to log into other Meta devices. You can also add your Meta account to the same Accounts Center as your Facebook or Instagram account to unlock connected experiences across Meta technologies — like finding your Facebook friends to play games with in VR or chatting with friends on Messenger. And if you don’t want to use your Facebook or Instagram account in VR, you don’t have to. Meta Horizon Profile After you finish creating a Meta account, you’ll be prompted to create a Meta Horizon profile. Your Meta Horizon profile is your social profile in VR and other surfaces, like from a web browser. You can customize how you appear to others — as a gamer or as your buttoned-up 9-to-5 persona. You can choose your Meta Horizon profile username that’s unique to you (e.g. WarriorMama365), the profile name that will be displayed to others while you’re in VR (e.g. Monique Smith), your profile photo, avatar and more. You can create one Meta Horizon profile per Meta account. Your Oculus friends will become your followers, similar to how it works on Instagram. This update provides more ways to be social and connect with others. You can choose whether to share your active status and activity updates, like the apps you own and your achievements, with your followers. If you already own a Meta VR headset, your Oculus friends will automatically become your followers and you’ll follow them back by default. You can choose to unfollow anyone or remove followers at any time. Privacy Controls We want to let you control who you interact with in VR and build your own community. As part of this update, you’ll now find a menu with three privacy options to help guide you through which privacy settings are the best fit for you: Open to Everyone, Friends and Family, and Solo. After you make your selection, you’ll have the opportunity to review and confirm your individual privacy settings are set the way you want them. You can change these settings at any time. As part of these privacy settings, you have the option to set your Meta Horizon profile to private, which means you’ll be asked to review and approve follower requests. If you choose this option, only your followers can see who you follow and who follows you. Keep in mind that people who don’t follow you will still be able to view your profile picture, avatar, username, display name, follower count and the number of people you follow. People can also still search for your name or username and send you follow requests. People between the ages of 13 and 17 will have their Meta Horizon profiles set to private by default.

Octopus: Scraping For Hire The first action is against a company called Octopus, a US subsidiary of a Chinese national high-tech enterprise that claims to have over one million customers. Octopus offers scraping services and access to software that customers can use to scrape any website. For a fee, Octopus customers can launch scraping attacks from its cloud-based platform or hire Octopus to scrape websites directly. Octopus offers to scrape data from Amazon, eBay, Twitter, Yelp, Google, Target, Walmart, Indeed, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. After paying for access to the scraping software, customers self-compromised their Facebook and Instagram accounts by providing their authentication information to Octopus. Octopus designed the software to scrape data accessible to the user when logged into their accounts, including data about their Facebook Friends such as email address, phone number, gender and date of birth, as well as Instagram followers and engagement information such as name, user profile URL, location and number of likes and comments per post. Meta is an industry leader in taking legal action to protect people from scraping and exposing these types of services, which provide scraping as a service across multiple websites. Companies like Octopus are part of an emerging scraping industry that provides automation services to any customer — regardless of who they target and for what purpose they scrape. This industry makes scraping available to individuals and companies that otherwise would not have the capabilities. Our lawsuit alleges that Octopus has violated our Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, by engaging in unauthorized and automated scraping and attempting to conceal their scraping and avoid being detected and blocked from Facebook and Instagram. We are seeking a permanent injunction against Octopus. Protecting people against scraping for hire services, operating across many platforms and national boundaries, also requires a collective effort from platforms, policymakers and civil society and is needed to deter the abuse of these capabilities both among those who sell them and those who buy them. Mystalk: Targeting Clone Sites We have also filed an action against a Turkish-based individual, Defendant Ekrem Ateş, for using automated Instagram accounts to scrape data from the profiles of over 350,000 Instagram users. These profiles were viewable to logged-in Instagram users. The Defendant published the scraped data on his own websites or “clone sites.” A clone site is a website that copies and displays Instagram profiles, posts and other information without authorization. Our External Data Misuse team has provided an overview of how we work to safeguard people against clone sites. Since February 2021, we have taken a number of enforcement actions against this Defendant, including disabling accounts, sending a cease and desist letter, and revoking his access to Meta’s services."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/06/features-to-find-and-connect-with-facebook-groups/","date":"2022-06-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Introducing Features to Quickly Find and Connect with Facebook Groups","text":"New Ways to Organize Your Groups On Facebook, we’re testing a new sidebar that helps you easily find your favorite groups more quickly. It will list your groups and the latest activity within them, like new posts or chats you haven’t yet seen. You can also pin your favorite groups so they show up first, discover new groups or even create your own. For example, if you want quick access to the latest recipes in your cooking group, you can now pin it to the top, find related groups and be inspired to start your own. We’re improving how each group is organized, so you can jump right into what’s happening. Within your group, you’ll see a new menu that includes things like events, shops and a variety of channels to make it easier to connect with others around the topics you care about. So, once you’re in your cooking group, you’ll be able to stay up to date with the group’s upcoming events, buy their latest swag and seamlessly join conversations. Connect in Smaller Spaces Admins can begin to create channels to connect with their groups in smaller, more casual settings where they can have deeper discussions on common interests or organize their communities around topics in different formats: Community chat channels: a place for people to message, collaborate and form deeper relationships around topics in a more real-time way across both Facebook Groups and Messenger. So when you’re in your new BBQ lovers group and need real-time feedback while attempting your first brisket, an admin can create a chat for that. Community audio channels: a feature where admins and members can casually jump in and out of audio conversations in real time. If you’re looking to hear best practices from other grill masters in your BBQ lovers group, there could be an audio channel created that’s available within your Facebook Group and on Messenger. Community feed channels: a way for community members to connect when it’s most convenient for them. Admins can organize their communities around topics within the group for members to connect around more specific interests. For example, if you’re in a BBQ lovers group, there could be a feed channel where you can post and comment on the topic of smokers."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/06/introducing-meta-pay/","date":"2022-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Messenger","Meta","Product News","WhatsApp"],"title":"Introducing Meta Pay","text":"Update on September 28, 2022 at 6:00AM PT: Starting today, Facebook Pay is transitioning to Meta Pay in nearly 200 countries globally. Learn more about where this transition is happening and where Meta Pay will be available. Originally published on June 23, 2022 at 9:00AM PT: Our company rebrand last year reinforced our commitment and vision to help build the next evolution of social connection — the metaverse. As Mark Zuckerberg announced yesterday, we’re changing Facebook Pay to Meta Pay to bring our payments offering closer to our rebrand. Meta Pay will be the same easy, secure way for you to shop, send money and donate to causes you care about across our technologies, including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as anywhere you previously would’ve seen the Facebook Pay button while shopping online. Meta Pay’s features and overall user experience people know from Facebook Pay will remain the same. This change is first rolling out in the US and will roll out globally over time. Just like with Facebook Pay, with Meta Pay people will be able to: Add their preferred payment method once, then use Meta Pay where available to make payments and purchases across our technologies and while shopping elsewhere online. View payment history, manage payment methods and update their settings in one place. Get 24/7 customer care via email or chat where available. Security and Protection for Payments We’ve offered trusted payment services since 2009. Today, we enable people and businesses in over 160 countries to make payments in 55 currencies. We continue to invest in security. Just as with Facebook Pay, Meta Pay encrypts and securely stores your payment card numbers, performs anti-fraud monitoring on our systems to detect unauthorized activity and notifies you if that occurs. You can also create a Meta Pay PIN or use your device’s face or fingerprint recognition to secure every payment. How to Set up Meta Pay If you have previously set up Facebook Pay, then there’s no action required to start using Meta Pay. All of your existing Facebook Pay information will remain the same in Meta Pay, including account details, your payment method and settings. If you’re new to Meta Pay, it’s easy to set up: Go to Payments settings. Enter your payment method and account information. Meta Pay supports most major credit and debit cards, as well as PayPal and Shop Pay. Use Meta Pay the next time you make a purchase, donate, or send money across our technologies or anywhere you see the Meta Pay button when shopping online. (Please note that availability, use cases and set up may vary.) What’s Next Innovative products can help give people, businesses and creators more control over their finances. We see an incredible opportunity to develop financial products that connect people to the digital economy. Meta Pay plays an instrumental role in connecting people and businesses now and in the future. These connections will help drive growth across the metaverse ecosystem. It’s important to us that we’re making sending and receiving money as simple, fast and cheap as sending a message to anyone, anywhere. And that we’re offering trusted, convenient ways to pay for goods and services anywhere in the world.

We’re also extending our commitment to not take fees on Subscriptions, Badges, Paid Online Events and Bulletin by an additional year, running until January 1, 2024. Expanding Facebook Stars Facebook Stars — a digital good that fans can buy and send to support creators — is now open to all eligible creators on Facebook Live, on-demand videos and will soon be available on Facebook Reels. Now, any creator who meets the following eligibility criteria will be able to begin receiving Stars from their fans: At least 1,000 followers through the last 60 days In one of these markets: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States Compliance with Partner Monetization Policies and Content Monetization Policies In addition to Facebook Live and on-demand video, we’re expanding our Stars on Reels test and will invite hundreds of thousands of creators to use Stars on Reels in the coming months. We’ve also launched new mobile tools for creators to onboard to Stars, check their Stars earnings by content type, manage their goals and more. More Ways to Earn with Facebook Reels Last year, we announced our Facebook Reels Play bonus program, which gives creators the opportunity to earn money from Facebook by creating and sharing eligible public Reels. To date, this has only been available to select creators on an invite-only basis. Soon we’ll open an application process for US-based creators who meet this criteria: 5+ original Reels created in the last 30 days 100,000+ plays in the last 30 days Meet our Partner Monetization Policies and Content Monetization Policies We’re also testing ways creators can earn money on both Instagram and Facebook with crossposted Reels. Creators will soon be able to use the “Paid Partnerships with” label for branded content on Facebook Reels and allow sponsors to easily convert them to Branded Content Ads. Helping Brands and Creators Collaborate on Branded Content We will soon begin testing Creator Marketplace on Instagram, where brands and creators can more easily build branded content partnerships. Creators will be able to indicate the brands and topics they’re interested in making branded content for, discover opportunities to partner with vetted brands and manage their brand deals without ever leaving the app. We’ll also begin testing in-app payments, so brands can pay creators for branded content directly through Instagram when a project is complete. Brands will also be able to discover and collaborate with Instagram creators through Meta Business Suite using demographic and interest filters for both a creator and their audience. When they’ve found a creator they want to partner with, they’ll be able to send a project that outlines the details of the opportunity, including deliverables and payment offered. Building Relationships with Fans Across Platforms We know that many creators have built a fanbase across a variety of online platforms. With that in mind, we’re announcing our first investment in interoperable monetization tools for creators: Interoperable Subscriber Groups. This enables creators to receive payments from their fans on other platforms, and automatically add them to their subscribers-only Facebook Groups. This will save creators’ valuable time by not having to manually admit individual members into their Facebook Groups and help them retain their most loyal fans. We’re launching an initial test this month with select partners, with plans to expand to more in the coming months. Digital Collectibles Available to More Creators, in More Places As we build for the metaverse, investing in web3 technologies and digital collectibles like NFTs is a crucial part of our long-term commitment to creators. We’re already seeing creators like @misshattan, @nylacollection_nft, @amber_vittoria and @bossbeautiesnft find success sharing their NFTs with their communities on Instagram. We’re expanding our test of digital collectibles on Instagram to more creators and a handful of additional countries. Creators and collectors will be able to share their digital collectibles across Facebook and Instagram after we begin rolling out the feature on Facebook with select US creators at a later date. We’ll also soon start to test NFTs in Instagram Stories with SparkAR. We’ve also compiled a guide on how NFTs work and why they’re essential for the metaverse. There will be no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram, and for now we won’t offer the ability to turn digital collectible posts into ads. We know that NFTs raise important sustainability questions. As part of Meta’s commitment to sustainability, we’re helping to reduce the emissions impact that might be associated with digital collectibles by purchasing renewable energy.

Mark Zuckerberg joined Eva Chen, VP Fashion Partnerships on IG Live to discuss our vision for avatars and the metaverse, as well as the opportunity this unlocks for brands and businesses. Watch the full conversation. Be Uniquely You Your avatar is a digital expression of your personality (or personalities). It can convey how much of an extrovert or introvert you are, your sense of humor and even your fashion sense. It lets you be your authentic self, and that in turn can help you connect more meaningfully with your friends, family, coworkers, or anyone else you meet on the road to the metaverse. We want to enable everyone to present the best version of themselves, which is why we’ve made it possible to customize your avatar with a wide variety of free outfits and accessories.

In fact, with more than a quintillion combinations of free avatar options already available, your choices will almost certainly be uniquely yours. We also know that people often want to change their look, whether in the real world or in digital spaces.

For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, food reflects not only the diversity and rich history of the AAPI community, but also the act of love that brings friends and families together. Through online communities like Subtle Asian Traits, younger generations throughout the Asian diaspora are coming together to celebrate their heritage, while also using these spaces to explore the duality of their Asian and American identities. Founded in 2018, Subtle Asian Traits now has over 2 million members, inspiring people to create their own “subtle” communities focused on different facets of Asian culture, shared experiences and interests, including Subtle Asian Baking, Subtle Curry Traits and Subtle Asian Cooking. “Love Through Food” features a number of cherished family recipes, while also sharing nostalgic memories from members of these Facebook groups. Yuzu Castella Strawberry Shortcake Fred Chang, Subtle Asian Baking Castella is a light cake first introduced to Japan by Portuguese missionaries centuries ago. It has since become a staple of wagashi (a traditional Japanese confectionery) and led to more varieties in other Asian countries, including Taiwan — birthplace of Subtle Asian Baking member Fred Chang. Raised in Southern California, Fred often reminisces about the castella cakes his mom would get from the local Taiwanese bakery for his after-school snack. So, the former MasterChef contestant created his own take on the treat as a dedication to her. Fred combined his childhood memories with Japanese baking techniques and flavors he learned while spending some time there, for a unique castella.

Several reports covering the second half of 2021 on topics ranging from government requests for user data, how we’re protecting people’s intellectual property, how often our services were disrupted, when we had to restrict content based on local laws in a particular country And a new Transparency Center reports page that makes country-specific regulatory reports more accessible We’re also releasing the findings from EY’s independent assessment of our enforcement reporting. Last year, we asked EY to verify the metrics of our Community Standards Enforcement Report since we don’t believe we should grade our own homework. EY’s assessment concluded that the calculation of the metrics have been prepared based on the specified criteria and the metrics are fairly stated, in all material respects. As we keep growing this report, we will also keep working on ways to make sure that it’s accurately presented and independently verified. Highlights From the Report The prevalence of violating content on Facebook and Instagram remained relatively consistent but decreased in some of our policy areas from Q4 2021 to Q1 2022. On Facebook in Q1 we took action on: 1.8 billion pieces of spam content, which was an increase from 1.2 billion in Q4 2021, due actions on a small number of users making a large volume of violating posts 21.7 million pieces of violence and incitement content, which was an increase from 12.4 million in Q4 2021, due to the improvement and expansion of our proactive detection technology. On Instagram in Q1 we took action on: 1.8 million pieces of drug content, which was an increase from 1.2 million from Q4 2021, due to updates made to our proactive detection technologies. We also saw an increase in the proactive detection rate of bullying and harassment content from 58.8% in Q4 2021 to 67% in Q1 2022 thanks to improvement and expansion of our proactive detection technology. We also continued to see a slight decrease in prevalence on Facebook from 0.11-0.12% in Q4 2021 to 0.09% in Q1 2022. Refining Our Policies and Enforcement Over the years we’ve invested in building technology to improve how we can detect violating content. With this progress we’ve known that we’ll make mistakes, so it’s been equally important along the way to also invest in refining our policies, our enforcement and the tools we give to users. For example, we’ve improved our transparency over the years to better inform people why we took down a post and we’ve improved the ability to appeal and ask us to take another look. We include metrics about appeals in this report. Recently we’ve begun to evaluate the effectiveness of our penalty system more deeply, for example testing the impact of giving people additional warnings before triggering more severe penalties for violating our policies. Last year we saw how policy refinements can ensure that we aren’t over enforcing beyond what we intend. Updates we made to our bullying and harassment policy better accounted for language that can be easily misunderstood without context. Enforcement systems also play a role: we recently began testing new AI technology that identifies and prevents potential over-enforcement by better learning from content that’s appealed and subsequently restored. For example, the same word that is an offensive slur in the U.S. is also a common British term for cigarette which would not violate our policies. We’re also testing a number of improvements to our proactive enforcement, to enable some admins of Groups to better shape group culture and take context into account around what is and isn’t allowed in their space; or to better reflect the context in which people write comments between friends, where sometimes good-natured banter could be mistaken as violating content. Looking Ahead For a long time, our work has focused on measuring and reducing the prevalence of violating content on our services. But we’ve worked just as hard to improve the accuracy of our enforcement decisions. While prevalence helps us measure what we miss, we’ve also been working on developing robust measurements around mistakes, which will help us better understand where we act on content incorrectly. We believe sharing metrics around both prevalence and mistakes will provide a more complete picture of our overall enforcement system and help us improve, so we are committed to providing this in the future. Finally, as new regulations continue to roll out around the globe, we are focused on the obligations they create for us. So we are adding and refining processes and oversight across many areas of our work. This will enable us to make continued progress on social issues while also meeting our regulatory obligations more effectively."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/05/facebook-widely-viewed-content-report-q1-2022/","date":"2022-05-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Widely Viewed Content Report, First Quarter 2022","text":"Today, we’re publishing the Widely Viewed Content Report (WVCR) for the first quarter of 2022. This report highlights the most-viewed organic content in Feed in the US, including domains, links, Pages and posts. It includes content recommended by Facebook and excludes advertising content. See the full report and Companion Guide for more information. Updates and Enforcements Based on feedback from several academic and civil society organizations, we are improving our link and domain data methodologies. Previously, we counted a link view as any time a post or video containing a link was viewed, even if the link was not front and center. However, the feedback from these organizations was that our data would be more meaningful if we only counted link or domain views that rendered a preview. Moving forward, links will need to render a preview in order to be counted as a view, as that more accurately represents what people are seeing. As part of the transition, the Q1 2022 report includes top viewed links using both our old and new methodologies. Starting next quarter, the WVCR will use only the new methodology. In this report, there were pieces of content that have since been removed from Facebook for violating our policies of Inauthentic Behavior. The removed links were all from the same domain, and links to that domain are no longer allowed on Facebook. During the last reporting cycle, we took seriously the feedback criticizing our approach to disclosing additional details about the content removed from Facebook that appears in this report. We have updated our removal disclosure framework in the report and Companion Guide. We will aim to disclose as much information as possible about removed content, including Inauthentic Behavior, that appears in the report moving forward. However, in instances where disclosing specific details on removed content would cause harm to our community, we will err on the side of keeping the community safe. Some lower-quality posts ended up amongst our most viewed last quarter, although it is important to note that the top 20 links in this report represent only 0.03% of all Feed content views in the US during the quarter. The fourth URL in the report linked to a YouTube video of a panel discussion held by a U.S. Senator that was rated False by one of our fact-checking partners. When that happened, we took a number of steps to limit the reach of this link, including adding a warning screen that shared more information about the claim, showing a notification warning to someone when they try to share the link and reducing the distribution of the link in Feed. Our strategy mirrors the recommendations of experts and academics in this field: deeper investments in outreach by trusted organizations online, as well as fact-checking as a primary approach to misinformation, since removing certain false claims about COVID-19 can exacerbate feelings of distrust with authorities and further marginalize populations. And without these features, this link would likely have reached more people, and those who viewed it would not have seen additional information and context from the false fact check. Insights from the WVCR help inform how we update our existing policies and products, and develop new ones, to address harmful or otherwise objectionable content. For example, we’ve been testing new ways to reduce clickbait, engagement bait and spam. While we’re seeing improvements from these tests, we will need to continually evaluate and refine our approach before seeing consistent results. We’ll continue to test alternative solutions to reduce engagement bait, misinformation and content from Pages that repeatedly violate our Community Standards."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/04/supporting-muslim-mothers/","date":"2022-04-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Supporting Muslim Mothers","text":"Video Playerhttps://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mp4captions-FilmOpen_MuslimMamas_4x5.mp4Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not foundDownload File: https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mp4captions-FilmOpen_MuslimMamas_4x5.mp4?_=100:0000:0000:00Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.

We’re introducing a number of features to help reduce admin workload and help admins efficiently manage their groups while also growing them with the relevant audiences. Today, we’re announcing new features to help Facebook group admins keep their groups safe and healthy, reduce misinformation, and to make it easier for them to manage and grow their groups with relevant audiences. Keeping Groups Safe and Reducing Misinformation Communities can only thrive as places to connect when they are safe. These new tools will help admins prevent the spread of misinformation and manage interactions in their group: Adding the ability through Admin Assist to automatically decline incoming posts that have been identified as containing false information. Incoming posts that contain content rated by third-party fact-checkers as false are declined before they are seen in the group, which helps reduce the visibility of misinformation. Expanding the functionality of “mute” and updating it to “suspend,” so admins and moderators can temporarily suspend group members and participants from posting, commenting, reacting, participating in a group chat, and creating or entering a Room in a group. More Easily Manage a Community To help make it easier for group admins to manage their communities, with these updates they can: Use Admin Assist to automatically approve or decline member requests, based on specific criteria they set up, including whether the prospective member has completed all member questions. More efficiently manage their group with new updates to Admin Home. This includes an overview page on desktop to quickly review things that need attention, a layout update to more easily sort and search tasks, and an insights summary on mobile to help admins understand the growth and engagement of their groups. Grow Groups with the Relevant Audiences These new tools will help admins who want to grow their communities by reaching the relevant people: To help make sharing groups and connecting with a specific community a more seamless experience, we’ve added QR codes which admins can download or copy and paste from the Share menu and share as they like. When scanned, people will be directed to the group’s About page where you can join or request to join. We’ve also added the option for admins to send invites via email to invite people to join their groups.

In this report, content and Pages were removed for violating our policies involving personal information bait, inauthentic behavior, phishing and harassment. We generally don’t publicly share additional identifying information about Pages or profiles that have been removed. As we look for ways to be more transparent about our most widely viewed content, we are exploring how best to provide more details going forward. (Updated on March 1, 2022 at 7:45PM PT to clarify our approach to identifying pages we’ve previously removed.) We’ve also seen promising results from our tests to reduce engagement bait — spammy posts that explicitly request reactions for purposes other than a specific call to action. These efforts included expanding our identifiers and introducing spacing rules to help prevent multiple posts that are identified as engagement bait from showing up one after the other in Feed. Our approach will continue to evolve over time. Expansion Plans By releasing the WVCR, we have the opportunity to shed new light on the content that is widely seen in Feed. We’ll continue to expand the scope of this report in the coming months. Our goal is to keep working with external stakeholders to improve and refine these reports and we will share more information as this develops."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/launching-facebook-reels-globally/","date":"2022-02-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Launching Facebook Reels Globally and New Ways for Creators to Make Money","text":"We’re launching Facebook Reels in more than 150 countries for creators around the world to grow their communities. To help creators earn money from Facebook Reels, we’re expanding tests of overlay ads, starting with banner and sticker ads. New Facebook Reels features include Remix, sharing to Facebook Stories and more. Today, we’re expanding the availability of Facebook Reels for iOS and Android to more than 150 countries across the globe. We’re also introducing better ways to help creators to earn money, new creation tools and more places to watch and create Facebook Reels. Our Fastest Growing Content Format Watching video is half of time spent on Facebook and Instagram, and Reels is our fastest growing content format by far. We’re focused on making Reels the best way for creators to get discovered, connect with their audience and earn money. We also want to make it fun and easy for people to find and share relevant and entertaining content. Since launching in the US, we’ve seen creators like Kurt Tocci (and his cat, Zeus) share original comedic skits, author and Bulletin writer Andrea Gibson offer a reading of their published poetry, Nigerian-American couple Ling and Lamb try new foods and dancer and creator Niana Guerrero do trending dances, like the #ZooChallenge. More Ways to Earn Money from Facebook Reels We’re creating a variety of opportunities for creators to earn money for their reels. Our Reels Play bonus program, part of our $1 billion creator investment, pays eligible creators up to $35,000 a month based on the views of their qualifying reels. These bonuses have helped creators like Jason the Great fund their reels creation and better understand what types of content works on Facebook. In the coming months, we’ll expand the bonus program to more countries, so more creators can get rewarded for creating reels that their communities love. Building on our deep experience in helping creators earn meaningful income from our monetization products like in-stream ads and Stars, we’re also building direct monetization options for Facebook Reels through ad revenue share and fan support. We’re expanding tests of Facebook Reels Overlay Ads to all creators in the US, Canada and Mexico, and to more countries in the coming weeks. We’re starting with two formats: banner ads that appear as a semi-transparent overlay at the bottom of a Facebook Reel, and sticker ads: a static image ad that can be placed by a creator anywhere within their reel. These non-interruptive ads enable creators to earn a portion of the ad revenue. Any creator in the US, Canada and Mexico who is part of our in-stream ads program is automatically eligible to monetize their publicly-shared reels with ads. By mid-March, these tests will expand to creators in nearly all countries where in-stream ads are available. Creators can learn more about overlay ads on our Meta for Creators blog. We’ll also begin testing Stars on Facebook Reels in the coming weeks, so that people can buy and send Stars while watching reels to support creators. Both overlay ads and Stars are designed so that as more people view and engage with Reels on Facebook, creator payouts can grow. We’re also launching brand suitability controls, including Publisher Lists, Blocklists, Inventory Filters and Delivery Reports for Banner and Sticker Ads in Facebook Reels in every region they are available, giving advertisers more control over how their ads appear in places they don’t consider suitable for their brand or campaign. Additionally, we’ve been testing full-screen and immersive ads in between Facebook Reels since October of last year, and will roll them out to more places around the world over the coming months. Just like with organic content on Facebook, people can comment, like, view, save, share and skip them. More Editing Features In addition to the features we announced last year, creators around the world will be able to access: Remix: Create your own reel alongside an existing, publicly-shared reel on Facebook. When you create a Remix, you can create a reel that includes all or part of another creator’s reel. 60-second Reels: Make reels up to 60 seconds long. Drafts: You will soon be able to create a reel and choose to “Save As Draft” below the Save button. Video Clipping: In the coming months, we’re planning to roll out video clipping tools that will make it easier for creators who publish live or long-form, recorded videos to test different formats. Create and Discover Reels in New Places Over the coming weeks, we’ll roll out the following updates to make it easier to create and discover reels in new places: Reels in Stories: You can share public reels to Stories on Facebook, making it easy to share favorite reels with friends and giving creators more visibility and reach. You’ll also be able to create reels from existing public stories. Reels in Watch: You’ll be able to watch reels directly within the Watch tab and we’re developing tools to help you create reels in the Watch tab as well. Top of Feed: We’re adding a new Reels label at the top of Feed so you’ll be able to easily create and watch reels in just a few clicks. Suggested Reels in Feed: In select countries, we’re starting to suggest reels that you may like in your Feed from people you do not already follow. We’re also exploring ways to make it easier for creators to share Reels to both their Facebook and Instagram audiences, such as crossposting. You can find Facebook Reels in Feed, Groups and Watch. When viewing a reel, you can follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it or share it with friends."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/facebook-counterspeech-in-pakistan-uk/","date":"2022-02-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Expanding Counterspeech Initiatives Into Pakistan and the UK","text":"When someone in Pakistan or the UK searches on Facebook for content related to organized hate or violent extremism, they will now be redirected to resources and support. Counterspeech is just one part of our strategy to tackle violent extremism, terrorism and organized hate. As part of our ongoing efforts to fight violent extremism and organized hate, we’re announcing the expansion of one of our flagship counterspeech initiatives, The Redirect Initiative, into Pakistan and the UK. Now when someone in Pakistan or the UK searches on Facebook using words associated with organized hate or violent extremism, the top search result will be a link to resources and support for how to leave violence and extremism behind. We’re partnering with Shaoor Foundation in Pakistan and Exit UK in the UK. Research shows that challenging violent, extremist views with positive counterspeech is one of the most effective ways to combat hate and extremism. Counterspeech involves responding to hateful, extremist narratives with empathy and alternative perspectives, rather than shutting these conversations down. Counterspeech is only effective if it comes from credible voices, so we’ve partnered with various NGOs and community groups on multiple counterspeech initiatives around the world including community programs, toolkits and research. “At Shaoor Foundation, we have worked for many years designing and implementing peace development programs in Pakistan. Building a society that is inclusive, respectful and peaceful and involves engaging the entire community, enabling people to speak up and providing a safe, accessible space to get support. We are pleased to partner with Meta on the Redirect Initiatve to help us scale our efforts and reach more people in need in Pakistan.” – Syed Ali Hameed, Executive Director at Shaoor Foundation The Redirect Initiative is already available in Australia, USA, Germany and Indonesia. A study by Moonshot CVE, an organization that works to counter extremism, found that the Redirect Initiative is successful at disrupting the connection between followers and the violent, extreme content they seek. “Working in partnership with technology companies like Meta will help ensure the safety and well-being of the public and those that might be vulnerable online. At Exit UK, we help people involved in the far-right leave, and we also support wider members of the community, many of whom feel they have no-one to talk to. We understand the importance of offering non-judgemental advice and support so that over time we can help people improve their critical thinking skills and develop positive counter narratives to challenge hate online.” – Nigel Bromage, Founder of Exit UK Counterspeech is just one part of our multi-faceted strategy to tackle violent extremism, terrorism and organized hate. Our policies clearly state that dangerous individuals and organizations themselves have no place on our platforms. We’ve banned thousands of individuals and organizations across the ideological spectrum under our rules, and we prohibit praise and support of these groups and their leaders on our platforms. We have a team of more than 350 dedicated specialists and sophisticated proactive detection technology to help us find and remove this content quickly. We’ll continue to work with diverse partners around the world to address extremism across society."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/healing-and-rebuilding-with-fellow-veterans/","date":"2021-12-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook"],"title":"Healing and Rebuilding With Fellow Veterans","text":"Like so many veterans, Jessica G. struggled with reintegration to “normal life” after serving in the Air Force.

The community hosts events, training and outreach to positively impact the lives of its 80,000 members, also known as “TONers.” At the peak of the pandemic, the community rallied together to provide a helpline for vulnerable members of the community to receive assistance. Jaidee Sadler. Black Owned Economy, UK Jaidee created Black Owned Economy to give Black-owned businesses and entrepreneurs a platform to promote their products and services, with hopes to drive economic equality for Black-owned businesses and make a lasting change in society. Today, she has made that a reality with over 150,000 members in Black Owned Economy, including thousands of Black-owned businesses that have benefitted from exposure and opportunities, which they would have otherwise lacked elsewhere. Throughout the pandemic, the community has come together to help business owners connect with new customers and secure brand partnerships. Mustafa Sharara.

We continually evaluate the effectiveness of News Feed ranking signals and give people insight into how content appears in their feeds. In 2021, we made significant progress in providing greater transparency into how the News Feed ranking process works, what gets distributed and why. We released new features to incorporate direct feedback we get from people who use Facebook by giving them more control over their feeds and reducing negative experiences. Here are some of the biggest changes and tests we launched this year: February: new tests to reduce political content in News Feed in response to direct feedback. March: the launch of Choose Who Can Comment, Favorites, the Feed Filter Bar, and an expansion of Why Am I Seeing This to suggested posts to provide people more context and control over the content they see and share in News Feed April: new tests to incorporate more direct feedback from people who use Facebook about the content they want to see more or less in their News Feed May: new options for where and how people can choose to see reaction counts on Facebook and Instagram August: our first-ever Widely Viewed Content Report to share what content is seen by the most people in News Feed in the US September: our Content Distribution Guidelines that list content and behaviors that receive reduced distribution in News Feed because they are problematic or otherwise low quality November: our second Widely Viewed Content Report and new ways to make News Feed controls easier to find and use for people and advertisers We continually evaluate the effectiveness of News Feed ranking signals and update or remove them when it makes sense. This month, we removed the transparent authorship signal because it did not have a significant effect on the news ecosystem. We still prioritize original reporting in News Feed and will continue to boost quality news by improving more impactful News Feed signals. News Feed uses personalized ranking, which takes into account thousands of unique signals to understand what’s most meaningful to you. Our aim isn’t to keep you scrolling on Facebook for hours on end, but to give you an enjoyable experience that you want to return to. It’s not in our interest to show you hateful or inflammatory content — our advertisers don’t want their ads shown next to it and our users tell us they don’t want it. We’re incentivized to reduce it. The prevalence of hate speech is now just about 0.03% of content viewed, or about 3 views per every 10,000 and continuing to drop. In the US, nearly 90% of the content people see is from friends, pages and groups they follow or are connected to because we use algorithmic ranking. We understand concerns people have about the lack of transparency over how algorithmic ranking systems work, so we’ve introduced new measures to give people more control over, and insight into, how content appears in their News Feed. Heading into the new year, we’ll continue to share updates on our tests and features that aim to give you more control and connect you to meaningful content."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/community-leader-spotlight/","date":"2021-12-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"21 Community Leaders Who Inspired Us in 2021","text":""},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/eliminating-stigma-through-storytelling/","date":"2021-12-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Eliminating Mental Health Stigma Through Storytelling","text":"<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span> For Matt, returning from serving in the Air Force in Iraq was a difficult readjustment.

New Professional Mode for Creator Profiles We want creators to reach their full potential on Facebook and that means giving them ways to earn money and gain insights that help them understand what types of posts resonate with fans and communities. Until now, these tools were only available on Pages. We know that many creators — especially those who are just starting out — are on profiles, so from today we’re announcing the roll-out of a new professional mode for profiles. Professional mode will open up access to post, audience and profile insights, as well as give easy access to monetization features – all in one place. For example, creators will be able to see the total number of shares, reactions and comments that posts have, and allow them to review their follower growth over time. Within the new tool, creators will remain in control of who sees what content they share; what will differ is that anyone will be able to follow them and see their public content in feed. This new mode is being tested with a limited number of profiles in the US, and will begin rolling out in EMEA next year. New Ways to Earn Money With Stars Since the roll-out of Stars last year, we’ve witnessed the amazing ways people have deepened their connection and supported creators they love. Available in 20 countries across EMEA, fans have purchased and sent Stars to their favourite Creators, such as UK based LadBaby and Dutch DJ and record producer, Armin Van Buuren. We want Stars to become the best way for people to show their appreciation on Facebook, so this week we announced new changes that will make buying and sending stars even easier. Up until now, Stars could only be purchased while watching videos – but we want Stars to exist everywhere that creators are engaging with their communities on Facebook. To do this, starting today we’re testing Stars in more places, including videos on News Feed, the Watch feed and the gaming tab. To make purchasing of Stars easier, we’re also launching Stars store, a new place for people to buy Stars via Facebook Pay and at lower rates, on mobile and desktop. When people purchase Stars through the Stars store, they will be deposited into their virtual wallet. They can then give them to eligible creators while watching their Facebook Live or on demand videos. Alongside these updates, we’re going to be introducing even more features that not only help Creators earn money, but equally give fans new opportunities to interact and feel closer to their favourite performers, influencers, gamers and more. This includes new bonus programmes for creators, as well as fan features including Stars Party and Stars badges. You can read more about these updates here. Facebook Reels Launching in EMEA in 2022 In September this year, we launched Reels on Facebook for iOS and Android in the US, creating a new space for short form, entertaining video experiences. Today, we’re announcing that this new feature will roll out in EMEA in the first half of 2022 – providing a new space for creators to creatively express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences. Just like Reels on Instagram, the feature on Facebook will consist of music, audio, video effects and much more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a Reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends who have access to their content. When shared publicly, Reels can reach everyone, not just existing followers, making it possible for the most creative, funny and inspiring creators to build an audience. In Groups, creators and group members can create and share reels to express themselves and engage in a more fun and visual way with their favourite interest communities. As we continue to build new products and invest in creators around the world, we’re excited to see how creators in EMEA continue to use these tools to share their passions, build a global community, and make money doing what they love."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/support-creators-with-stars-fest-on-facebook/","date":"2021-12-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Support Creators With Stars Fest on Facebook","text":"Starting today and throughout December, we’re celebrating Stars Fest on Facebook by featuring limited-time sales, virtual gifts and badges, exclusive creator livestreams and a Stars Creator Day. We’re launching a Stars store for people to easily purchase Stars at lower prices and introducing other new features for fans to send Stars together and get recognized as a top sender. We’re also offering a Stars bonus to double creators’ earnings and giving away $3 million in free Stars to fans. Today, we’re kicking off Stars Fest on Facebook — a month-long celebration to spotlight creators and recognize the amazing ways people have supported them with Stars. We’re offering bonuses to double creators’ earnings, limited-time sales on Stars, creator competitions and exclusive live streaming events. We’re also introducing new Stars features to help people show support for creators they love in new ways. Expanding Stars to More Places Our vision is for Stars to be the best way for people to show appreciation for creators on Facebook. To offer creators more ways to earn Stars, we’re testing them in videos on News Feed, the Watch feed and the gaming tab. And next year, we’ll test Stars in Reels. Introducing Stars Store We’re also launching Stars store, a website where people can easily purchase Stars using Facebook Pay. Stars are deposited into people’s virtual wallets to then send to eligible creators during Facebook Live, on-demand videos or Live Audio Rooms. In the Stars store, fans get more Stars for their money at lower prices, so they can support even more of their favorite creators. New Interactive Features and Top Sender Recognition We’re also introducing Stars Party, a fun way for people to send Stars together. When a certain number of people send Stars during a livestream, a countdown timer will appear and the community has five minutes to hit a Stars goal together. If the goal is met, the screen is taken over by a shooting Star animation and a giant “Thank You” message. From December 22-January 3, creators will receive a bonus of $50 for every completed Stars Party. Our new feature Stars badges appear next to a top Stars sender’s name for each creator when they comment on a live stream. The Stars badge will also show their tier, depending on how many Stars that person has sent to the creator over the past week. Additionally, we’re launching a Stars leaderboard on Facebook Live that displays the weekly top Stars senders for each creator. We’ll also roll out more leaderboard categories in the future, like top monthly senders and top all time Stars senders. Earn More With Bonuses and Free Stars As part of our $1 billion investment in creators, we’re launching the Stars Double bonus. Through March 31, Meta will match certain creators’ Stars earnings, up to $750 a month. All in, creators could earn up to $3,750 in bonus payments. The program is invite-only and available in all markets where Stars is available. Over the next few months, we’ll also give $3 million in free Stars to fans. People offered free Stars will receive an invitation to claim them while watching a creator’s live video. They can then send them immediately to their favorite creator or add a comment to accompany the gift. Stars Fest Now Until December 31 Stars Fest is taking place from now until December 31, featuring limited-time sales, special bonuses and exclusive events. From December 13-19, we’re featuring a diverse lineup of creator livestreams, including Roccibella, Candylover89, John Nonny. And on December 10, we’re hosting Stars Creator Day to collaborate with creators and help them learn more about Stars. To encourage new and longtime fans to send Stars during Stars Fest, Stars are on sale from December 6-26. Fans can also purchase limited-time virtual gifts, and if they send more than 500 Stars during Stars Fest, a special badge will appear next to the sender’s name. We’re excited to help creators like you earn a living doing what you love with products like Stars.

In this new interactive game, people can play solo or multiplayer to complete mazes and create their own mazes and challenges. We’re also announcing new products that blend playing, watching, and connecting on Facebook Gaming: Play with Streamer brings creators and their communities together in a game and Facebook Interactives turn watching gaming livestreams into an interactive experience. For more than 40 years, PAC-MAN™ has been a cultural icon in games, television, music and film. And today, we’re sharing the next step in this evolution by launching PAC-MAN COMMUNITY, exclusively on Facebook Gaming. This isn’t your parents’ PAC-MAN, but you can still access the entire classic PAC-MAN in the game. Developed by Genvid and in partnership with BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment, PAC-MAN COMMUNITY connects players, gaming video creators, viewers and world builders together in new ways. Play solo or through co-op multiplayer in groups of up to four people, working together to complete each maze while still competing against each other for the highest point total. In addition to PAC-MAN COMMUNITY’s built-in mazes, players can also create their own levels and challenges through the Maze Creator tool. Play Watch Connect With Play Watch Connect, we’re delivering more immersive and engaging social experiences that build community around games on Facebook. We’re bridging three pillars together — playing games, watching gaming video and connecting with others around games — to create richer experiences between people using our technologies, including in PAC-MAN COMMUNITY. Through our new Play with Streamer feature, Facebook Gaming creators can invite their communities directly from their livestream to join them in-game to play or watch. Player-created mazes will be featured inside the game daily, and soon we’ll launch community-oriented challenges and mazes curated and cultivated by streamers’ communities. We’re also making live gaming video an active experience with the introduction of Facebook Interactives, which allows you to participate while simultaneously watching a gamer’s livestream. In PAC-MAN COMMUNITY, people viewing a 24/7 livestream in Watch mode can also power up either the AI PAC-MAN or Ghosts and compete. Mazes are turned into 3D streams, powered by Unreal Engine, where viewers can interact directly with the video player. Coming later in the beta, by interacting with a streamer’s session, viewers can work collectively toward global unlocks for the Maze Creator tool. When a streamer isn’t live, the Watch tab will feature AI characters, just like an arcade machine that isn’t being played. We believe games bring people together in powerful ways, whether that’s playing games together, watching gaming videos, or connecting around games in Facebook Groups.

This is a required program for people who are at the highest risk of being targeted, so we’re sending emails and Facebook notifications to help make sure they’re aware of the requirement. People who receive the notification will have 14 days to enroll or they’ll be asked to enroll upon login if they miss the deadline. No action is required unless you receive this prompt. Learn more about the details on the program and how to enroll. Originally published on December 6, 2021 at 6:00AM PT: As part of our ongoing improvements to security, we’re expanding Facebook Protect, a program designed for people that are likely to be highly targeted by malicious hackers, including human rights defenders, journalists, and government officials. These people are at the center of critical communities for public debate. They enable democratic elections, hold governments and organizations accountable, and defend human rights around the world. Unfortunately this also means that they are highly targeted by bad actors. Facebook Protect helps these groups of people adopt stronger account security protections, like two-factor authentication, and monitors for potential hacking threats. We first tested Facebook Protect in 2018 and expanded it ahead of the 2020 US election. We began our global expansion in September of this year. Since then, more than 1.5 million accounts have enabled Facebook Protect, and of those, nearly 950K accounts newly enrolled in two-factor authentication. We are on track to expand the program to more than 50 countries by the end of the year, including the United States, India, and Portugal. No action is required unless you get a notification on Facebook that you’re eligible to enroll. Mandating Protections For Most Targeted People Two-factor authentication — particularly by using third-party authentication apps — significantly improves the security of your online accounts. Right now, anyone can enroll in two-factor authentication and everyone should. However, this important feature has been historically underutilized across the internet — even by people that are more likely to be targeted by malicious hackers, such as journalists, activists, political candidates and others. With Facebook Protect, we worked to make enrollment and use of two-factor authentication as frictionless as possible for these groups of people by providing better user experience and support. We’re also starting to require that they use it. We know that there will always be a small subset of users that won’t immediately enroll, for example those that happen to be less active on our platform at the time of a given mandate. However, we believe this is an important step forward for these highly targeted communities. What we’ve seen so far is encouraging: in early testing, simplifying our enrollments flows, improving customer support, and mandating Facebook Protect brought adoption rates to over 90 percent in one month for these groups. Over the next several months, we’re going to carefully expand this requirement globally. We’re encouraged by our early findings and will continue to improve Facebook Protect over time."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/ways-to-give-back-holiday-season/","date":"2021-11-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"More Ways to Give Back This Holiday Season","text":"To celebrate GivingTuesday, we’re matching up to $8 million in donations made to eligible fundraisers on Facebook, and we’re expanding access to fundraising on Instagram so more than 1.5 million organizations can bolster their causes.

We’re testing a new feature for people to offer free items on Facebook Neighborhoods. Update on November 30, 2021 at 4:00AM PT: Today, you can check out special GivingTuesday episodes from Facebook Watch original talk shows “Peace of Mind with Taraji” with Taraji P.

Originally published on November 15, 2021 at 7:00AM PT: Every day, people all over the world use our apps to share the ups and downs of life, build communities around shared interests and common causes, and start and grow businesses. One of the most rewarding things we see is the great compassion and generosity so many people show – whether it’s using our tools to help out in their communities, give blood, support local businesses or raise funds for good causes. Since we first launched fundraising tools more than five years ago, our community has raised more than $5 billion for nonprofits and personal causes on Facebook and Instagram. The holiday season is a time when many of us think about how we can give something back. With GivingTuesday around the corner on November 30th, we’re offering people more ways to give back to their communities across our apps. Fundraising on GivingTuesday GivingTuesday is a day when people all around the world come together to support causes that are important to them. In celebration of our community’s generosity, we will match up to $8 million in eligible donations made to fundraisers on Facebook for nonprofits in the United States. You can learn more about eligibility, the match structure and donation caps. Find a nonprofit to support by going to facebook.com/fundraisers. And to celebrate Instagram’s 11th birthday, we’re matching the fundraisers of seven creators, up to $50,000 each, through GivingTuesday. We’re also expanding the set of nonprofits that people can fundraise for on Instagram. In the coming weeks, you’ll now be able to raise money for more than 1.5 million organizations by adding a fundraiser to a post. This will be available in countries that support nonprofit fundraisers. As always, 100% of donations raised for nonprofits through fundraisers created on Facebook and Instagram go directly to the organization picked by the donor. All donations are processed securely by Facebook Pay, making it easy to donate in just a few taps. New Ways to Support Your Local Community People are increasingly using Facebook to help the vulnerable in their local communities, support small businesses and share information in local groups. So, we’re expanding tests of Neighborhoods, a single destination to build and strengthen local communities on Facebook, to an additional 132 cities in the United States. We’re also testing a new Giving Exchange feature for people to offer items they’re no longer using to others. Finding a Cause You’re Passionate About On GivingTuesday, teams of gaming creators will go live in Warzone on Facebook Gaming as part of a tournament to raise money for their nonprofit of choice. Each team will use our charity livestreaming tools, select a nonprofit and encourage donations from their audiences during the broadcast. Additionally, a total prize pool of $25,000 from Meta will be donated to the top four teams’ selected nonprofits, made in the teams’ names. You can watch and donate between 11:00AM and 3:00PM PT on November 30 at fb.gg/facebookgaming. We’ve also brought back our #BuyBlack Friday campaign, which we started last year to harness some of the energy from the biggest physical retail day of the year in support of Black-owned small businesses. In the US, Black-owned businesses continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic, and this holiday season will be make or break for many of them. More than a third of US Black-owned businesses expect to make at least half of their annual revenue in the last three months of the year. The #BuyBlack Friday show, hosted by NY Times best-selling author, journalist and television host, Elaine Welteroth, airs every Friday in November on Facebook. Tune into upcoming episodes on November 19th and November 26th featuring two great small businesses – House of Takura and Beaux & Paws. You can also find great ideas for presents and stocking fillers in our #BuyBlack Friday gift guide collections, which are available all month long in both the Facebook and Instagram Shop tabs.

With Product Recommendations and Shops in Groups, we’re bridging community and commerce. With an early test of Live Shopping for creators, we’re also creating new opportunities for brands, creators and people to build relationships. We’re helping people make more informed purchases through reviews and information from other shoppers. Gone are the days when shopping meant stacks of catalogs and infomercials. Today we look to our friends, family, creators and groups we trust for inspiration. With more than 1.8 billion people using Facebook Groups every month, today we’re introducing new ways to shop in Groups and get inspiration from friends and creators you trust on Facebook: Engage with Your Community Through Shopping We’re introducing Shops in Groups so you can support the communities you care about by buying products from them. For example, members of OctoNation, an octopus fan group, can now buy stickers, mugs and apparel to show their love of octopuses. People often ask members of groups for recommendations on their experience with a product and how it performs. With Product Recommendations in Groups, we’ll show products that members recommend when you ask for guidance within a group and make it easy to purchase those products from shops on Facebook. We’re also introducing Top Product Mentions in News Feed as a way to help you discover products that were recommended by peers from groups that you’re a part of. Today we’re creating educational and fun shopping events that bring together a community of fans, creators and brands. We’re beginning to test Live Shopping for creators to make it easier for the creators you already know and trust to partner with brands and highlight their favorite products. Product Recommendations in Groups Top Product Mentions Live Shopping for creators OctoNation, a nonprofit organization working to educate people about octopuses, is already using Shops in Groups to engage with their members: “Allowing our members to view and purchase OctoNation’s products in a trusted space they were familiar with has significantly increased sales. This enhanced stream of income has allowed us to bring some of our volunteers into paid positions and increase our profit margins by ordering in bulk. Merch allows OctoNation to foster a stronger sense of community by giving group members an opportunity to display their love of octopuses, start conversations on a topic they love and recruit other members into our community.” – Warren Carlyle, founder and CEO, OctoNation Shops in Groups Get Information from Others and Make More Informed Purchases Community replies allows you to see and respond to questions from people who are considering buying an item that you’ve already purchased, and vice versa. Shoppers want to feel confident in the purchases they make, and we’ve recently expanded ratings and reviews we’re giving people more information before they buy on Facebook and Instagram. Now you can shop more confidently with reviews from e-commerce sites, provided by Bazaarvoice and Yotpo. By tagging brands you’ve purchased from in your posts on Instagram, businesses can add your images to their shop’s product detail pages. This way, other shoppers can see your photo of the product and feel more confident making a purchase. Our communities are central to how we discover trends, brands and products, and these new tools will make it easier to get inspiration and information from friends, groups, creators and others."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/facebook-widely-viewed-content-report-q3-2021/","date":"2021-11-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Widely Viewed Content Report, Third Quarter 2021","text":"We’re publishing the Widely Viewed Content Report for the third quarter of 2021 to highlight the most viewed organic content in News Feed, which includes posts about people’s favorite movies and Pages dedicated to personal interests. We’ll continue to meet with academics and experts to discuss these reports in detail and consider their input when exploring product changes tied to this work. Today we’re publishing the Widely Viewed Content Report (WVCR) for the third quarter of 2021. This is the second edition of this report, which highlights the most viewed organic content in News Feed, including domains, links, Pages and posts in the US. This report includes content recommended by Facebook and excludes advertising content. Read more about its scope and methodology in our Companion Guide. There’s been a lot written about polarizing content dominating News Feed, so this report sheds more light on the types of content that reaches the most people, which includes posts about people’s favorite movies and Pages dedicated to entertainment, cooking and family. Still, these reports have highlighted gaps in our enforcements and demotions, which we’re taking immediate steps to address. Updates Since the Q2 Report Since releasing our inaugural WVCR, we have engaged with academics, civil society groups and researchers to identify the parts of our first report they found most valuable, which metrics needed more context and how we can best support their understanding of content distribution on Facebook. Based on these discussions, we’ve provided more clarity into our methodology and included more context in the Companion Guide. Moving forward, we’ll continue to work with external stakeholders to refine and improve these reports. Removing Violating Content We remove content from Facebook when it poses a real risk of harm, like graphic violence, hate speech or fake COVID cures. Our Community Standards prohibit hateful or harmful content, and we invest heavily in developing ways of identifying it and acting on it quickly. Learnings from our first WVCR have led to better applications and development of existing policies, including the removal of a network of more than a hundred Pages, profiles and domains for inauthentic behavior. Reducing Low-Quality Content We also use News Feed ranking to reduce the distribution of posts that may contain content people find objectionable, but don’t necessarily meet the bar of removal under our policies. In creating these reports, we learned that our efforts to reduce engagement bait and low quality content needed to be refined to address more of it, which has led to changes in how we identify and reduce it. For example, we’re expanding our engagement bait identifiers, evaluating the impact that comments from friends can have on showing unconnected posts in News Feed, and experimenting with reducing that impact. We’re also exploring new experiments to reduce posts with unrelated links. We anticipate that these changes may lead to a reduction of low-quality content in future reports; however, it may take several reporting cycles for our reduction efforts to make a noticeable impact. Ongoing Work and Transparency We are committed to sharing more about the changes we’re making based on what we’ve learned from the WVCR. We will also continue to meet with academics and experts to discuss these reports in detail and consider their input when exploring new tests or product changes tied to this work.

We’re announcing a new experience that brings together the best of Pages and Groups into one place, allowing admins to use an official voice with their communities. Today, we’re hosting the Facebook Communities Summit and announcing new tools in Facebook Groups that empower community builders to accomplish more together. As communities continue to evolve, we want to make it easier for people to collaborate in new ways and have fun while they’re doing it. We also continue to invest in new ways to keep groups on our platform safe. Build the Community You Want and Strengthen Culture Every group develops its own culture. To make their groups look and feel unique, admins will be able to: Easily customize the colors, post backgrounds and fonts that display in groups, along with the emojis members can use to react to content. Use feature sets to select preset collections of post formats, badges, admin tools and more that can be turned on for their group with one click, so that communities can engage in the ways they want. Suggest preferred formats for members to use when they post in their group. This will appear in a new posting button that stays with members as they browse the group, eliminating the need to scroll back to the top when they’re ready to post. Create a unique greeting message and share group rules that new members will automatically receive when they join a group, so they can develop a sense of belonging sooner. Members will also soon be able to give community awards, like Insightful, Uplifting or Fun, to content that they find valuable. These awards encourage engagement, make the content more visible to members and help demonstrate the group’s content at its best. Deepen Connections With one main feed for discussions in a group, it can be hard for members to find content they want to engage with. We’re testing the ability for admins to create subgroups within their groups for specific topics, regions or occasions, that can be managed in one place, so that members can more easily go deeper on what they care about. When people want to connect in real-time, they will soon be able to use Community Chats in both Facebook and Messenger, as well as create recurring events when they want to get together more regularly, either virtually or in-person. Manage Your Community These new tools will help make it easier for admins to manage their groups: Admins can pin announcements and choose the order in which they show up in a new Featured section at the top of groups, to ensure their community sees the most important details first. We’re updating Admin Assist to give personalized suggestions on criteria to add, provide more information around why Admin Assist declines certain content and make Admin Assist accessible across all platforms with availability on Facebook Lite. Community Chats will allow admins to create a chat for the admin and moderator team so that they can better coordinate decisions in real time. Sustain Your Community We’re also introducing a suite of tools to help admins sustain their efforts and advance the purpose of the group. We’re testing the ability for admins to: Create community fundraisers to raise money for group projects, to offset the costs of running the group or to enable members to show their appreciation for their admins and moderators. Sell merchandise they’ve created through a shop in their group, enabling members to show their support and deepen their sense of community. Create paid subgroups that members can subscribe to for a fee to gain exclusive access to more content, experiences like coaching or networking or deeper conversations. As part of our broader paid subscription effort across Facebook, this new feature enables admins to sustain their communities while offering more meaningful experiences to their members. With different ways to earn or raise money through their groups, admins can tailor their approach to what works best for their community. A New Vision For Communities on Facebook Some communities use both Groups and Pages to connect with people, which can be more time intensive for admins to manage and unclear to members where to go for what. So, we’re introducing a new consumer experience that brings the best of Pages and Groups into one place. For admins of Facebook Groups, the new experience will allow them to use an official voice when interacting with their community. For admins of Facebook Pages, the new experience will help them build community in a single space for members to participate and engage. Admins of Pages will also be able to take advantage of the moderation tools that Groups have today. This new experience is in early testing over the next year, before it becomes more broadly available. During today’s Facebook Communities Summit, we’ll also celebrate and recognize the diverse communities on Facebook through our first-ever Community Day and the Facebook Community Awards.

We need to weigh the positive use cases for facial recognition against growing societal concerns, especially as regulators have yet to provide clear rules. In the coming weeks, Meta will shut down the Face Recognition system on Facebook as part of a company-wide move to limit the use of facial recognition in our products. As part of this change, people who have opted in to our Face Recognition setting will no longer be automatically recognized in photos and videos, and we will delete the facial recognition template used to identify them. This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology’s history. More than a third of Facebook’s daily active users have opted in to our Face Recognition setting and are able to be recognized, and its removal will result in the deletion of more than a billion people’s individual facial recognition templates. Making this change required careful consideration, because we have seen a number of places where face recognition can be highly valued by people using platforms. For example, our award-winning automatic alt text system, that uses advanced AI to generate descriptions of images for people who are blind and visually impaired, uses the Face Recognition system to tell them when they or one of their friends is in an image. For many years, Facebook has also given people the option to be automatically notified when they appear in photos or videos posted by others, and provided recommendations for who to tag in photos. These features are also powered by the Face Recognition system which we are shutting down. Looking ahead, we still see facial recognition technology as a powerful tool, for example, for people needing to verify their identity, or to prevent fraud and impersonation. We believe facial recognition can help for products like these with privacy, transparency and control in place, so you decide if and how your face is used. We will continue working on these technologies and engaging outside experts. But the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole. There are many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society, and regulators are still in the process of providing a clear set of rules governing its use. Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate. This includes services that help people gain access to a locked account, verify their identity in financial products or unlock a personal device. These are places where facial recognition is both broadly valuable to people and socially acceptable, when deployed with care. While we will continue working on use cases like these, we will ensure people have transparency and control over whether they are automatically recognized. But like most challenges involving complex social issues, we know the approach we’ve chosen involves some difficult tradeoffs. For example, the ability to tell a blind or visually impaired user that the person in a photo on their News Feed is their high school friend, or former colleague, is a valuable feature that makes our platforms more accessible. But it also depends on an underlying technology that attempts to evaluate the faces in a photo to match them with those kept in a database of people who opted-in. The changes we’re announcing today involve a company-wide move away from this kind of broad identification, and toward narrower forms of personal authentication. Facial recognition can be particularly valuable when the technology operates privately on a person’s own devices. This method of on-device facial recognition, requiring no communication of face data with an external server, is most commonly deployed today in the systems used to unlock smartphones. We believe this has the potential to enable positive use cases in the future that maintain privacy, control and transparency, and it’s an approach we’ll continue to explore as we consider how our future computing platforms and devices can best serve people’s needs. For potential future applications of technologies like this, we’ll continue to be public about intended use, how people can have control over these systems and their personal data, and how we’re living up to our responsible innovation framework. Ending the use of our existing Face Recognition system means the services it enables will be removed over the coming weeks, as will the setting allowing people to opt into the system. This will lead to a number of changes: Our technology will no longer automatically recognize if people’s faces appear in Memories, photos or videos. People will no longer be able to turn on face recognition for suggested tagging or see a suggested tag with their name in photos and videos they may appear in. We’ll still encourage people to tag posts manually, to help you and your friends know who is in a photo or video. This change will also impact Automatic Alt Text (AAT), a technology used to create image descriptions for people who are blind or visually impaired. AAT currently identifies people in about 4% of photos. After the change, AAT will still be able to recognize how many people are in a photo, but will no longer attempt to identify who each person is using facial recognition. Otherwise, AAT will continue to function normally, and we’ll work closely with the blind and visually impaired community on technologies to continually improve AAT. You can learn more about what these changes mean for people who use AAT on the Facebook Accessibility page. If you have opted into our Face Recognition setting, we will delete the template used to identify you. If you have the face recognition setting turned off, there is no template to delete and there will be no change. Every new technology brings with it potential for both benefit and concern, and we want to find the right balance. In the case of facial recognition, its long-term role in society needs to be debated in the open, and among those who will be most impacted by it. We will continue engaging in that conversation and working with the civil society groups and regulators who are leading this discussion."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/shop-on-facebook-instagram-holiday-season/","date":"2021-10-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News"],"title":"Shop What You Love on Facebook and Instagram This Holiday Season","text":"Starting November 1, we’ll host daily Live Shopping experiences on Facebook and Instagram with brands like Benefit Cosmetics, Cocokind, Macy’s, Paintbox Nails, Tanya Taylor, Ulta Beauty, Vuori and Walmart to educate shoppers and share exclusive deals.

Today, we are announcing measures to curb attempts to sell land in ecological conservation areas within the Amazon rainforest on Facebook Marketplace. We are updating our commerce policies to explicitly prohibit the buying or selling of land of any type in ecological conservation areas on our commerce products across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. We will now review listings on Facebook Marketplace against an international organization’s authoritative database of protected areas to identify listings that may violate this new policy. Protected areas are crucial for conserving habitats and ecosystems and are critical to tackling the global nature crisis. Based on specific criteria, Facebook will seek to identify and block new listings in such areas. By using complementary information sources like this database, we are adding another barrier for people trying to list these lands on Marketplace. We are announcing this today, and enforcement will now begin to ramp up. Over time, we will observe how this process works and make improvements as appropriate. Our commerce policies continue to require buyers and sellers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using Facebook Inc. commerce surfaces. These are the first steps Facebook is taking to address this issue, and as with other integrity initiatives we will continue working to prevent people from circumventing our enforcement.

We’re bringing short form, entertaining video experiences and tools that have inspired creators on Instagram to more creators and audiences on the Facebook app. With the ability to create reels and have their Instagram reels suggested to people on Facebook, creators — whether they’re just starting out or already have a large following — will have more ways to express themselves, grow their communities and reach new audiences. Reels on Facebook can consist of music, audio, effects and more. You can find them in News Feed or in Groups, and when viewing a reel on Facebook, you can easily follow the creator directly from the video, like and comment on it, or share it with friends. Connect with New Audiences Creators can build an audience with Reels in different ways across Facebook: Get Discovered in News Feed: Reels can reach everyone, not just your existing followers, making it possible for the most creative, funny and inspiring people to break out. People can discover reels based on their interests and what’s popular both at the top of News Feed alongside Stories and Rooms and in a new, dedicated News Feed section. Express Yourself in Groups: Creators and group members can create and share reels in Groups to express themselves and engage in a more fun and visual way with their favorite interest communities, like The Galactic Empire of Chonky Woofers and Post-Apocalypse Office. And for admins, we’re rolling out a new ‘Single Theme’ group setting that makes it easy to prompt members to share their reels. Share from Instagram to Facebook to Reach New Audiences: We’re testing the ability for Instagram creators to have their reels recommended on Facebook. In this test, a small number of Instagram creators will see an option to have their reel recommended on Facebook. The choice to do this is completely in their control. Earn Money for Reels with Bonuses As part of our commitment to invest over $1 billion in creators through 2022, we’re also offering a new bonus program to help creators earn money when people view their reels. The Reels Play bonus pays eligible creators based on the performance of their reels, and will be available on both Facebook and Instagram. After seeing creators embrace the Instagram Reels Summer bonus, we hope this new bonus will allow more creators like @imjeremyclyde to make money from their content: “The ‘Reels Summer’ bonus enhanced my motivation for creating more Reels and my overall creativity as a content creator. It’s also always great to see other content creators posting more and being the creatives that they are — it’s inspiring!” The Reels Play bonus will initially be invite-only, beginning in the US and potentially expanding globally over time. Interested creators can sign up to learn more about the Facebook Reels Play bonus and can visit our Facebook for Creators blog to learn best practices for creating reels. We’re focused on developing a suite of creator monetization options and will explore additional opportunities for them to earn money for their Reels. On Facebook, we will test sticker ads and banner ads in Reels and explore integrating with Stars. And similar to Instagram Reels, we’ll soon begin testing full-screen and immersive ads between reels to help small businesses and brands connect with new audiences in delightful ways. Just like with organic Reels content, people can comment, like, view, save, share and skip them. Unleash Your Creativity with Reels Anyone can create a reel on Facebook and become a creator on the global stage or just share them with friends and family. Simply create a reel from the top of Feed or while you’re watching a reel and either select video clips from your camera roll or capture something new. You can also tap Reels at the top of News Feed or within a group’s feed. As you’re creating reels on Facebook, you can access a variety of creative editing tools, including: Audio: Search for a song from the Facebook music library for your reel. You can also use your own original audio by simply recording a reel with it. You can add audio from the camera before you capture a clip, or you can add audio later after you have captured or uploaded a clip. You can also create a reel with original audio from other public reels by selecting Use Audio from the other person’s reel. AR Effects: Select one of the many effects in our augmented reality library, created by either Facebook or third-party developers, to record multiple clips with different effects. Timer and Countdown: Set the timer to record any of your clips hands-free without having to press the shutter button. Speed: Speed up or slow down the video while you record, which helps you stay on a beat or make slow motion videos. Multi-clip: Stitch together multiple clips into a single reel either by recording them together or selecting them from the gallery. After you’ve created a reel, you can choose how to share it. Reels on Facebook are set to be public for creators who are over 18, but you can change the audience at any time. Audience options include Public, Friends or Friends except."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/content-distribution-guidelines/","date":"2021-09-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy"],"title":"Sharing Our Content Distribution Guidelines","text":"Update on December 15, 2021 at 9:45AM PT: Today, as part of our ongoing efforts to provide more visibility into our content ranking processes, we have made the first update to the Content Distribution Guidelines. Today’s update includes revised definitions of content we identify as borderline and likely violating our community standards, sensational health content and unoriginal video content. As we continue to evaluate the types of problematic and low-quality content and behavior that we think should receive reduced distribution on our platform, we will regularly make these periodic updates to the Guidelines with amendments archived in the change log. The Guidelines and amendments can both be found in our Transparency Center. Originally published on September 23, 2021 at 2:00PM PT: Today, we’re publishing Facebook’s Content Distribution Guidelines to share more detail on how content is distributed on Facebook. While the Community Standards make it clear what content is removed from Facebook because we don’t allow it on the platform, the Content Distribution Guidelines make it clear what content receives reduced distribution on News Feed because it’s problematic or low quality. Many of these guidelines have been shared in various announcements, but in efforts to provide clarity and make them more accessible, we want to bring them together in one easy-to-navigate space in our Transparency Center. As we work to improve News Feed, we rely on overarching core values to guide that process. The changes we make, particularly ones focused on limiting the spread of problematic content, are based on extensive feedback from our global community and external experts. Over the last few years, we’ve consulted more than 100 stakeholders across a range of relevant focus areas to solicit feedback on how to bring more insightful transparency to our efforts to reduce problematic content. We’ve previously discussed our efforts to reduce the distribution of problematic or low-quality content based on the needs of people, creators, and our community. There are three principal reasons why we might reduce the distribution of content: Responding to People’s Direct Feedback: We listen to people’s feedback about what they like and don’t like seeing on Facebook and make changes to News Feed in response. Incentivizing Creators to Invest in High-Quality and Accurate Content: We want people to have interesting new material to engage with in the long term, so we’re working to set incentives that encourage the creation of these types of content. Fostering a Safer Community: Some content may be problematic for our community, regardless of the intent. We’ll make this content more difficult for people to encounter. What’s Next? We’ll continue to update the Content Distribution Guidelines to provide people with information about how we define and treat problematic or low-quality content that doesn’t otherwise violate our Community Standards. How Will This Impact My Page? Content Distribution Guidelines are already in effect today, some globally and others specific to certain locations. Our Publisher Guidelines continue to provide specific information relevant to creators interested in learning more about distribution on Facebook. We’ll also continue to expand our Page Quality tab to help provide more transparency into policies that may be affecting a Page."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/state-officials-covid-19-announcements/","date":"2021-09-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Helping State Officials Share COVID-19 Information with Local Communities","text":"It’s critical to reach people at the local level when facing challenges such as public health crises.

Our staff have used Facebook’s COVID Announcement Tool to reach residents more broadly and to overcome common communications barriers, certainly resulting in more people getting vaccinated and more safety for our city as a whole.” – Mayor Mike Coffman, Aurora, Colorado When authorities mark posts as COVID-19 Announcements, we expand their reach so more people see them. We also send notifications about these posts to local community members and make the information visible in the COVID-19 Information Center. “Thanks to Facebook’s support in helping us promote COVID-19 information on social media, Alabama residents have been kept informed about updated health guidance regarding mask wearing, social distancing, handwashing, and vaccine distribution. We have seen the impact this support has had in reaching our community at this critical time.” – Alabama Department of Public Health Since launching this feature in the US in May, we’ve sent out more than 183 million notifications driving people to COVID-19 announcements from their state and local governments. “Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Linn County Public Health has been committed and devoted to providing ongoing updates about the disease — and more recently about the vaccines — based on current science and data to our neighbors. Facebook’s COVID-19 Announcements tool has helped inform our community of important information.

Games We’re Launching This Fall Available today, daily sports prediction game Pick & Play Sports is the first game we’re launching, in partnership with Whistle Sports. Fans will get points for correctly predicting the winner of a big game, the points scored by a top player or specific events that unfold during a match. Players can earn bonus points for building a streak of correct predictions over a series of days. In the upcoming months, we will introduce new games with TV shows like CBS’s Survivor and ABC’s The Bachelorette, sports leagues like Major League Baseball and LaLiga Santander and premier digital publishers like BuzzFeed. Fantasy Survivor Each week, fans will select a set of Castaways to be on their Fantasy Survivor team and answer a series of questions about the upcoming episode. Fans will then receive points based on the events that unfold in that week’s episode. MLB Home Run Picks For each day during the MLB Postseason, fans can pick the teams that they think will hit the most home runs during that day’s action. Fans will then earn points based on correct predictions and whether their team hits home runs or grand slams — with extra points coming for those hit late in the game. Fantasy: “The Bachelorette” Each week, fans will select a group from the men vying for Michelle Young’s heart to be on their Fantasy: “The Bachelorette” team and answer a series of questions about the upcoming episode. Fans will then receive points based on the actions and events involving the bachelors on their team and face off with their friends to prove who is the biggest Bachelor Nation fan of them all. LaLiga 3 to Win Predict the winning club — or predict a draw — for select LaLiga matches this season. Players earn points for a correct pick, with the goal being to accumulate as many points as possible over the remainder of the season. Players will be able to predict the results for three games per matchday.

Product On Facebook, we’ll have a hub of information, including highlights from official Paralympic broadcast partners, team and athlete overviews, a Paralympic Games quiz, posts from friends and more. Fans can visit the hub beginning August 23 by clicking on the #Paralympics hashtag. Via the @Paralympics Instagram account, fans will have access to an AR effect that enables them to attempt to mirror the movements of Someity, the official Paralympics mascot, and earn AR medals for their performances. The @Wethe15 Instagram account will also feature an AR effect to help fans promote the “We the 15” movement, which aims to end discrimination against people with disabilities, who make up 15% of the global population. Content People will also be able to enjoy a range of Paralympic-related content across the Facebook family of technologies. We’ve teamed up with the IPC to build “Paralympics Raw: Emotion Unites Us,” an immersive WebXR visual and spatial audio experience that recreates phenomenal moments by Para athletes. The experience features the voices of athletes — including Birgit Skarstein, Katie Kelly, Chan Ho Yuen, Lex Gillette and Abbas Karimi — who share their stories of competing in Para Sport and at the Paralympic Games. With animated visuals and spatial sound, people feel like they’re in the moment with the athlete. Fans can access the experience by visiting https://www.paralympic.org/raw-emotions via their desktop, mobile or Oculus browsers beginning August 24. Over the course of the competition, the IPC will also deliver a steady cadence of live programming and highlights on the Paralympic Games Facebook Page. Earlier this summer, we launched a Reels-centric series on the @instagram account, which brought fans behind the scenes with Para athletes as they prepared for Tokyo. We’ve also worked with the IPC to launch a four-part film series on Facebook Watch that explores how sport has created a positive change for disabled communities around the world, in support of #WeThe15. Available via the Paralympic Games Facebook Page, the series highlights how Facebook helps communities in the US, UK, Brazil and New Zealand come together online — and the real-world impact it has offline. The US film features Dylan Hronec, also known as the “Surfing Samurai,” an adaptive surfer from New York. Dylan is part of the Surf For All community, a non-profit that aims to help people from all walks of life experience the joy of surfing. He explains how Facebook helps adaptive surfers find out about the community. The UK film features The Derby Wheelblazers, a competitive wheelchair basketball team that welcomes anyone of any ability. The story focuses on Joe Hinsley, who has spina bifida. Joe shares the transformative role sport can have, helping him grow from a shy kid to a confident player and assistant coach. In the film, he talks about how Facebook helps the group overcome the challenge of recruiting new members and bond as a community. The Brazil film highlights the Associação Bola pra Frente Esportes Adaptados, a São Paulo-based football team for players with disabilities, focusing on amputees. It features Daniel, whose leg was amputated after a motorcycle crash. He explains how, through Facebook, the association can reach and inspire more people with disabilities. The New Zealand film spotlights the Te Arawa Swimming Club, an inclusive, community-run club in Rotorua that believes swimming should be accessible to all. It covers the story of Siobhan Terry, who was born with clubfoot. Through swimming, the opportunities the Te Arawa Swimming Club has offered her, and the use of Facebook, Terry has gone on to not only coach other new Para swimming recruits, but also become an ambassador for the sport and a 2024 Paralympic Games hopeful."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/community-standards-enforcement-report-q2-2021/","date":"2021-08-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Community Standards Enforcement Report, Second Quarter 2021","text":"Today we’re publishing the Community Standards Enforcement Report for the second quarter of 2021. This report provides metrics on how we enforced our policies from April through June. This is our 10th report and some of our long-term trends include: Prevalence of hate speech has decreased for three quarters in a row since we first began reporting it. This is due to improvements in proactively detecting hate speech and ranking changes in News Feed. Hate speech content removal has increased over 15X on Facebook and Instagram since we first began reporting it. Our proactive rate (​​the percentage of content we took action on that we found before a user reported it to us) is over 90% for 12 out of 13 policy areas on Facebook and nine out of 11 on Instagram. We now include 13 policy areas on Facebook and 11 on Instagram, and have added new metrics on appeals, restores, and prevalence. In addition to our Community Standards Enforcement Report, this quarter we’re also sharing: The newly released Widely Viewed Content Report Ongoing updates on our efforts to promote reliable information about COVID-19 and vaccines and reduce harmful misinformation We’re committed to sharing meaningful data so we can be held accountable for our progress, even if the data shows areas where we need to do better. Today, we’re also releasing the first in a series of reports that will give an overview of the most widely-viewed content in Facebook’s News Feed, starting with the top 20 most viewed domains, links, Pages and posts in the US. These reports are public in the Transparency Center and we will include them with each quarterly Community Standards Enforcement Report going forward. Promoting Reliable Information and Reducing Harmful Misinformation About COVID-19 COVID-19 is still a major public health issue, and we are committed to helping people get authoritative information, including vaccine information. We continue to remove harmful COVID-19 misinformation and prohibit ads that try to exploit the pandemic for financial gain. Since the start of the pandemic through June: We removed more than 20 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram globally for violating our policies on COVID-19-related misinformation. We have removed over 3,000 accounts, pages, and groups for repeatedly violating our rules against spreading COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation. We displayed warnings on more than 190 million pieces of COVID-related content on Facebook that our third-party fact-checking partners rated as false, partly false, altered or missing context, collaborating with 80 fact-checking organizations in more than 60 languages around the world. When they rate a piece of content with one of these ratings, we add a prominent label warning people before they share it and show it lower in people’s feed. We’ve provided authoritative information to help improve vaccine acceptance, connecting 2 billion people to resources from health experts through our COVID-19 Information Center and educational pop-ups on Facebook and Instagram and helping 4 million people in the US alone access vaccines through our vaccine finder tool. We know from public health research that people are more likely to get vaccinated if they see others in their community doing so. In countries where vaccines are available to most people, we ramped up our efforts to show when friends and neighbors share their support for vaccines through profile frames and stickers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 18 million people globally have used Facebook profile frames supporting vaccines. More than 25% of people globally on Facebook have already seen someone use the UNICEF COVID-19 vaccine profile frames. Over 29% of people globally on Instagram have seen someone use a COVID-19 vaccine sticker. Instagram COVID-19 vaccine stickers have been used by more than 7.6 million people globally. For people in the US on Facebook, vaccine hesitancy has declined by 50%. Globally, we have also seen vaccine acceptance rising. For example, our COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey data which we conduct in partnership with Carnegie-Mellon and University of Maryland has since the beginning of the year shown vaccine acceptance rising by 35 percent in France, 25 percent in Indonesia, and 20 percent in Nigeria. Community Standards Enforcement Report Highlights Progress on Hate Speech Prevalence of hate speech on Facebook continued to decrease for the third quarter in a row. In Q2, it was 0.05%, or 5 views per 10,000 views, down from 0.05-0.06%, or 5 to 6 views per 10,000 views in Q1. We removed 31.5 million pieces of hate speech content from Facebook, compared to 25.2 million in Q1, and 9.8 million from Instagram, up from 6.3 million in Q1. This is due to continued improvement in our proactive detection. Our investments in AI enable us to detect more kinds of hate speech violations on Facebook and Instagram. This technology helps us enforce our policies across billions of users and multiple languages. Steady, continuous AI improvements and advancements, such as the Reinforcement Integrity Optimizer (RIO), enable our AI models to spot hate speech using real-world data and improve over time. Updates in Child Safety Keeping children safe on our apps is critical. Previously, we reported one metric, child nudity and sexual exploitation of children. In our latest report, we’ve added more data and created two new reporting categories under the broader topic of child endangerment: 1) nudity and physical abuse and 2) sexual exploitation. We changed this to provide a more detailed, transparent overview of our efforts in this space to child safety experts, academics and the general public. Child nudity and physical abuse content we took action on: On Facebook: 2.3 million with a proactive rate over 97% On Instagram: 458,000 with a proactive rate of over 95% Child sexual exploitation content we took action on: On Facebook: 25.7 million with a proactive rate of over 99% On Instagram: 1.4 million with a proactive rate of over 96% In Q2 2021, we improved our proactive detection technology on videos and expanded our media-matching technology on Facebook, allowing us to remove more old, violating content. Both enabled us to take action on more violating content. Recent Trends In addition to new categories and ongoing improvements in reducing prevalence, we saw steady progress across many problem areas. On Facebook in Q2 we took action on: 6.2 million pieces of organized hate content, compared to 9.8 million pieces in Q1 2021 — this marks a return to pre-Q1 levels as we update our proactive detection technology 16.8 million pieces of suicide and self-injury content, compared to 5.1 million pieces in Q1 2021 — due to a technical fix we made that allowed us to go back and catch violating content we missed 34.1 million pieces of violent and graphic content, compared to 30.1 million pieces in Q1 2021 On Instagram in Q2 we took action on: 367,000 of organized hate content, up from 325,000 in Q1 2021 3 million pieces of suicide and self-injury content, up from 2.6 million in Q1 2021 7.6 million pieces of violent and graphic content, compared to 5.5 million pieces in Q1 2021"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/widely-viewed-content-report/","date":"2021-08-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Introducing the Widely Viewed Content Report","text":"Today, we’re releasing the first in a series of reports that will give an overview of the most widely viewed content in News Feed, starting with domains, links, Pages and posts in the US. The Widely Viewed Content Report will be updated quarterly in the Transparency Center and will be released in conjunction with each quarterly Community Standards Enforcement Report. Our inaugural report contains some noteworthy takeaways: The content that’s seen by the most people isn’t necessarily the content that also gets the most engagement. Read more about how engagement — the likes, shares, and comments a Page or post generates — doesn’t equate to its reach, the number of people who actually see it. The majority (57%) of posts that people see is from their family and friends, in line with changes we made in the past so that content from friends and family makes up a larger portion of News Feed. Fewer than 13% of content views were on posts with links, and the top-viewed news domains account for only 0.31% of all content views in News Feed. Of those outlets, mainstream media dominate by views. We’ve explained before why only a small portion of News Feed is news. This report sheds light on the kinds of posts and Pages that are actually the most widely viewed — with many of the most-viewed Pages focused on sharing content about pets, cooking, family, and relatable viral content. Our insights tool, CrowdTangle, was built to help people get an idea of content from Pages that gets the most likes, comments and reshares. We want this data to be broadly available to people, which is why we’re publishing it directly in our Transparency Center. We see this as a complement to insights that can be found through CrowdTangle, which is primarily a tool used by publishers. It’s important to note that there is so much content on Facebook that even the most-viewed content is still a small portion of what people see. Given the customized nature of News Feed, most of what people see on Facebook is uniquely personalized to them. To paint a complete picture and provide more extensive detail of what people actually see on Facebook, we’ll release Widely Viewed Content Reports on a quarterly basis, starting in the US and eventually including more international data. Transparency is part of everything we do, and releasing these reports is the latest step in our efforts to share data and hold ourselves accountable. Whether it’s sharing our content enforcement progress through the Community Standards Enforcement Report, submitting ourselves to external audit, working to release new data and tools (like the recently-announced Researcher API) to researchers through Facebook Open Research and Transparency (FORT), or expanding our Data for Good partnerships to help address COVID-19 or disaster relief, we’re committed to sharing useful and accurate information with the public.

These updates include user experience improvements, two new destinations: Photobucket and Google Calendar, and one new data type: Facebook Events. We’re excited about these new changes because they provide people with even more choice and control, while also fostering innovation with our partners. This update includes: A completely rebuilt experience that’s simpler and more intuitive — people can now more easily see what destinations and what data types are supported Greater transparency around the status of each transfer, including making it easier to retry certain transfers The ability to simultaneously start multiple data transfers for one destination Filters that allow people to more precisely select the data they want to transfer At Facebook, we plan to continue providing our users with secure data portability features they can trust. We’re also working with developers to expand the selection of data types and destinations we support. However, to ensure user data is safe both while it is being transferred and after, we’re continuing to call for government regulation to make clearer rules about who is responsible for protecting that data as it is transferred to different services.

Every setting that lived in Privacy Shortcuts lives in the redesigned Settings page or in Help & Support. Our research shows that our new mobile Settings page improves people’s experience. Originally published on August 4, 2021 at 12:00PM PT: As part of our ongoing efforts to improve people’s experience on Facebook, we’ve redesigned the Facebook Settings page to make our tools easier to find. We’ve streamlined the layout, while keeping all the previous settings. Whether it’s managing the ads people see, adjusting sharing settings, or curating an audience for posts, people shouldn’t have to think too hard about where to start. That’s why we’ve reduced the number of categories, and renamed them to more closely match people’s mental models. Settings are now grouped into six broad categories, each containing several related settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies. We’ve also relocated several standalone settings so that they live alongside related settings. For example, the News Feed setting, which previously lived in a smaller category of its own, now lives under Preferences where it is grouped with similar settings. We’ve also made some improvements to the settings search function, making it easier to find the settings you need if you don’t know the exact name or location of the setting you’re looking for. Our research shows that using more specific and descriptive names makes settings easier to find. That’s why we’ve unbundled the Privacy Settings category and moved the settings previously contained within it into other categories. Finally, to more easily guide you through important privacy and security settings on Facebook, we’ve added another shortcut to Privacy Checkup, right at the top of the Settings landing page. As we said in our Privacy Progress update earlier this year, we strive to design products and features with privacy in mind. Part of that means making information and tools accessible and easy to find. We’re confident this new settings page will make it easier for people to visit their settings, find what they came for, and make the changes they want. The Facebook Settings redesign rolls out August 4 for Android, iOS, mobile web and FB Lite.

We’re developing AI to find and remove underaged accounts, and new solutions to verify people’s ages. We’re also building new experiences designed specifically for those under 13. As per our terms, we require people to be at least 13 years old to sign up for Facebook or Instagram. In some countries, our minimum age is higher. When people open our apps to sign up for an account, we ask them for their birthday. This is called an age screen. Those who are underage are not allowed to sign up, and we restrict people who repeatedly try to enter different birthdays into the age screen. But verifying someone’s age is not as simple as it might sound. While age screens are common in our industry, young people can — and often do — get around them by misrepresenting their age. So how are we addressing this problem? Understanding people’s age on the internet is a complex challenge across our industry, and we already have various methods of finding and removing accounts used by people who misrepresent their age. For example, anyone can report an underage account to us. Our content reviewers are also trained to flag reported accounts that appear to be used by people who are underage. If these people are unable to prove they meet our minimum age requirements, we delete their accounts. Many argue that collecting ID is the answer to this industry problem, but there are significant limitations to this approach: many young people don’t have an ID, ID collection isn’t a fair or equitable solution, nor is it foolproof. Access to government IDs varies depending on where you live in the world, as does the information contained in an ID such as a birthday. Some have access to IDs but don’t get them unless they choose to travel, and some simply can’t afford one. Indeed, lack of ID access disproportionately impacts underserved communities around the world, particularly young women. Even if they did have an ID, some young people may be uncomfortable sharing it. For example, perhaps they’re a young member of the LGBTQ+ community and they worry about having their identity attached to a pseudonymous account. While these are not new problems to solve, we will continue to invest in finding the right solutions. We need to keep people who are too young off of Facebook and Instagram, and we want to make sure that those who are old enough receive the appropriate experience for their age. Today, we’re sharing how we’re tackling this issue from multiple angles. Here are a few examples. Using AI to Detect Age Artificial intelligence is the cornerstone of the approach we’re taking. We’ve developed technology that allows us to estimate people’s ages, like if someone is below or above 18. We train the technology using multiple signals. We look at things like people wishing you a happy birthday and the age written in those messages, for example, “Happy 21st Bday!” or “Happy Quinceañera.” We also look at the age you shared with us on Facebook and apply it to our other apps where you have linked your accounts and vice versa — so if you share your birthday with us on Facebook, we’ll use the same for your linked account on Instagram. This technology isn’t perfect, and we’re always working to improve it, but that’s why it’s important we use it alongside many other signals to understand people’s ages. This technology is also the basis of important changes we’re making to keep young people safe. We’re using it to stop adults from messaging young people that don’t follow them on Instagram. And we announced today that we will no longer showing posts from young people’s accounts, or the accounts themselves, to adults that have shown potentially suspicious behavior. We plan to apply this technology across our apps to create more age-appropriate experiences and safety measures for young people. We’re also building similar technology to find and remove accounts belonging to people under the age of 13. We’re focused on using existing data to inform our artificial intelligence technology. Where we do feel we need more information, we’re developing a menu of options for someone to prove their age. This is a work in progress and we’ll have more to share in time. Working With Industry Partners We’re also in discussions with the wider technology industry on how we can work together to share information in privacy-preserving ways that helps apps establish whether people are over a specific age. One area we believe has real promise is working with operating system (OS) providers, internet browsers and other providers so they can share information to help apps establish whether someone is of an appropriate age. This has the dual benefit of helping developers keep underage people off their apps while removing the need to go through differing and potentially cumbersome age verification processes across multiple apps and services. While it’s ultimately up to individual apps and websites to enforce their age policies and comply with their legal obligations, collaboration with OS providers, internet browsers and others would be a helpful addition to those efforts. Building Experiences for People Under 13 We’re also looking at ways we can reduce the incentive for people under the age of 13 to lie about their age. The reality is that they’re already online, and with no foolproof way to stop people from misrepresenting their age, we want to build experiences designed specifically for them, managed by parents and guardians. This includes a new Instagram experience for tweens. We believe that encouraging them to use an experience that is age appropriate and managed by parents is the right path. It’s going to take a village to make this experience compelling enough so that this age group wants to use it, but we’re determined to get it right. Working With Experts We believe this comprehensive plan is the right one for Facebook and Instagram, but the natural question for readers is how we’re going to do everything in a way that respects people’s privacy, and prioritizes safety at every turn. We’re fortunate to draw from multiple industry experts, organizations and bodies of research here. First, to help us develop new products and features for young people, in 2017 we convened a group of experts in the fields of online safety, child development and children’s media to share their expertise, research and guidance. This group, known as the Youth Advisors, helps shape our work by providing feedback on the development of new products and policies for young people. We meet regularly with the group, which includes the Family Online Safety Institute, Digital Wellness Lab, MediaSmarts, Project Rockit and the Cyberbullying Research Center. We recently expanded this group to add new experts in privacy, youth development, psychology, parenting and youth media, and will continue expanding to include a diverse range of global perspectives. Our new members include: Jutta Croll at Stiftung Digitale Chancen, Pattie Gonsalves at Sangath – It’s Okay To Talk, Vicki Shotbolt at ParentZone UK, Dr. Alfiee M. Breland-Noble at AAKOMA Project, Rachel Rodgers at Northeastern University, Janis Whitlock at Cornell University and Amelia Vance at the Future of Privacy Forum. Next, we continue to welcome productive collaboration with lawmakers and elected officials to guide us. Age verification is a focal point of multiple new and proposed regulatory frameworks on data protection, online harm and child safety. In particular, the ICO Age Appropriate Design Code, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Irish DPC’s Children’s Fundamentals and the EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive, among others, underpin the work we’re doing to create privacy and safety standards for building youth products at Facebook. We plan to share these standards publicly in the coming months. Finally, we’ll continue to take part in dialogues about age verification, developing industry best practices and forming new technical standards. For example, we recently joined the Advisory Board for the euCONSENT Consortium to help develop EU-wide infrastructure for online age verification and parental consent. This is complex territory, with competing interests and considerations. We’re committed to working with experts and the broader industry to give young people a compelling and safe experience on our services."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/connecting-fans-to-tokyo-olympic-games/","date":"2021-07-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News","WhatsApp"],"title":"Connecting Fans to the Games","text":"This summer, people around the world will use our apps to experience the Games.

Bonuses will also help creators understand which content performs best for them. Bonus programs will be seasonal, evolving and expanding over time. While some bonus programs are already available to select creators by invitation, such as our Badges and Stars Challenges, we will launch a dedicated place for bonuses within the Instagram app this summer, and in the Facebook app in the fall, where creators can learn about bonuses available to them. Bonuses Available Now The first bonus opportunities on Facebook, available by invitation now, help creators earn more while learning how to create content that can be monetized. In-Stream bonus pays an earnings bonus over the next four months to select video creators using in-stream ads. Stars bonus: We’re expanding our Stars Challenges program to include select gaming creators. Participating video and gaming creators will receive a monthly bonus for hitting specific Stars milestones over the next three months. On Instagram, the first bonuses will be available by invitation and will reward creators for signing up for IGTV ads and using badges in Live and Reels: The IGTV ads bonus, available now to creators in the US, allows creators to earn a one-time bonus for signing up for IGTV ads, which enables them to earn a share of revenue when ads run during their videos. The badges in Live bonus, available now to creators in 11 countries, rewards creators when they meet certain milestones with badges, such as going Live with another account. The Reels Summer bonus, launching in the coming weeks to creators in the US, will pay creators for creating great Reels content on Instagram. Creators can find the Reels summer bonus in the new Bonuses section of the Instagram app and will earn based on how their reels perform. We plan to roll out more bonus programs between now and the end of the year. Our Approach to Bonus Programs We want to be transparent as we develop these programs so it’s clear to creators where and how they can earn. To do so, we will follow a set of principles to guide how our bonus programs distribute the investment: Authentic: Designed to reward creators who are creating original and high-quality content that people enjoy. Attainable: Developed to support creators of all sizes across a wide range of verticals, with earning opportunities for a variety of content on our apps. Simple and Actionable: Easy-to-understand requirements that creators can take action on to help them grow their businesses. Creators in all bonus programs must comply with our Partner Monetization Policies. Sign Up to Learn More To express interest in and sign up to learn more about both our monetization products and bonus programs on Facebook, visit Monetization Tools on Facebook for Creators. Creators on Instagram can learn more in the Bonuses section of the app, which will be available in the coming weeks. More to Come This investment brings together our many programs and initiatives across the company that support creators and enable them to earn a sustainable income on our apps. It complements our growing suite of monetization tools – earning ad revenue through in-stream and IGTV ads; fan support via Badges, Stars, fan subscriptions and paid online events; partnering with brands via branded content and affiliate; and creator shopping tools. We’ll share more details on individual programs, including eligibility and how creators can apply, as they become available."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/new-ways-to-elevate-experts-in-facebook-groups/","date":"2021-07-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"New Ways to Elevate Knowledgeable Experts in Facebook Groups","text":"Today, we’re announcing new ways to connect with and spotlight subject matter experts in Facebook Groups. There are more than 70 million admins and moderators running active Facebook groups around the world. Many of these groups are home to subject matter experts who love to share their knowledge, from fitness trainers to highly skilled crafters. Now, it’s easier than ever to help experts stand out in groups and offer ways for them to engage with their communities. Enabling Admins to Designate Group Experts We’ve launched a new way for admins to recognize knowledgeable members in their group by designating them as group experts. Admins now have the ability to select specific members in their communities who stand out, empowering them to play a more meaningful role. After accepting this role, group experts will receive a badge next to their names in the group, making it easier for group members to spot informative posts and comments from designated experts. Now available to select groups across desktop and mobile, admins can collaborate with group experts to host Q&As, share perspectives on a topic and respond to questions. Helping Experts Discover and Nurture Thriving Communities We’re starting to test giving some people in fitness and gaming the option to identify specific topics they’re knowledgeable about, like yoga or a particular game. Group admins can then search for these specific topics, discover relevant people who are not yet members and invite them to join as group experts. To make it easier for experts to engage with their followers, we’re introducing automatic invites, which allows them to invite their recently engaged Page followers to join groups they’ve created. As their communities grow, they’ll be able to create more collaborative places for discussion and content sharing. We began rolling out Streamer Fan Groups, a new type of expert-led community designed specifically with gamers in mind to small subsets of creators. Streamer Fan Groups help increase live streaming distribution and community building, supporting streamers in developing deeper connections with their fans after the livestream ends. More Ways for Experts and Their Communities to Connect It’s important for people to have ways to seek and share expertise beyond traditional posts and comments. Here’s how they can do this in their communities: Ask Questions: When people write a post that looks like a question in their group, the post will automatically be upgraded to a format that encourages others to share advice, information or perspective. Create Live Audio Rooms in Groups: A low-pressure way for subject matter experts and communities to get ideas and inspiration from each other through audio-first conversations. Live Audio Rooms are coming to Groups this summer. Host Q&As: A way for people to lead real-time question-and-answer sessions with their communities, in a text-based format. Answered questions are featured in an interactive, swipe-able stack, while all questions may be viewed in the Q&A’s comment section. You can read more about these updates in our Community Blog. Join us on Wednesday, July 14 at 9AM PT for our Facebook Live, Community Connect: Tools for Engaging Experts and Tips for Personal Growth."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/mobile-cloud-gaming-accelerates-on-facebook/","date":"2021-06-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Technology & Innovation"],"title":"Mobile Cloud Gaming Accelerates on Facebook","text":"Last October, we announced the closed beta of our cloud gaming platform to expand the library of mobile games on Facebook, playable instantly, with no installs, wherever and whenever players want. We started with launching a handful of cloud-streamed games on Android and web in select US regions.* We’ve now scaled our infrastructure significantly, and today we’re announcing coverage to over 98% of people in the mainland United States. We’re on track to hit 100% by fall of this year. We’re also beginning our roll out in Canada and Mexico, and will reach Western and Central Europe by early 2022. Over 1.5 million people are playing cloud-streamed games on Facebook Gaming every month. For cloud gaming, that’s significant. The format still has a way to go, but this growth is an early signal that people are having fun and we’re on the path to delivering developer value. Our approach to cloud gaming is different from others. We’re still not doing the things we said we wouldn’t do in October — we’re not spinning off a separate service, charging subscription fees or trying to replace consoles, PCs or mobile phones. We’re building up our free-to-play mobile catalogue of games in a measured way and deepening the games people can enjoy with their friends on Facebook. For us, cloud-streaming is a way to deliver cross-device, instant access to games, wherever people want to play. People play our cloud-streamed games right alongside games in HTML5. And they shouldn’t have to think too hard about how the games are delivered so long as we do our jobs right. Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed Rebellion As we grow our games library, we’re proud to welcome Ubisoft as a partner. Assassin’s Creed is one of the best-selling, most popular game series on the planet. Now as an extension of our mobile-first approach, Assassin’s Creed Rebellion by Ubisoft has launched as a cloud-streamed game on Facebook Gaming. It’s a mobile entry in the long-running series that blends together elements of RPG, strategy and action games. You’ll take command of an entire Brotherhood as you recruit deadly agents from throughout the entire timeline including Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Edward Kenway and Eivor. Strike down Templars using your hero roster’s arsenal of skills, assassinate your enemies, face them head-on or choose a stealthier approach. Assassin’s Creed Rebellion is a unique take on the series that has garnered a loyal fanbase and millions of downloads since its initial release. You can play Assassin’s Creed Rebellion on the Facebook app on Android and the web at fb.gg/play. In addition to Assassin’s Creed Rebellion, other Ubisoft mobile titles have launched including Hungry Shark Evolution and Hungry Dragon. And in the coming months, they’ll add: Mighty Quest and Trials Frontier. We now have over 25 cloud-streamed games on the platform, with recent additions including: Roller Coaster Tycoon Touch by Atari, Lego Legacy Heroes Unboxed and Dragon Mania Legends by Gameloft and State of Survival by FunPlus. We’re continuing to reduce latency for cloud games on both Android and desktop too. Lowering latency caps further will unlock even more game genres. Our sweet spot right now is in mobile sports, card, simulation, strategy, action/adventure and puzzle genres with more genres coming in the future. Focusing on latency-tolerant games and categories means we can deliver the best experience across a variety of devices. Powering Up How You Play Finally, we’re continuing to update our Play destination on Facebook Gaming. The most recent redesign is all about making it easier for people to discover and play the best and most popular games, whether they’re cloud-streamed or HTML5. The redesign will introduce ranked categories like “Top in the US” to find the best games easily, handpicked lists with recommendations from the team at Facebook Gaming, and better filtering and category sorting options. This makes it more convenient than ever to find and play the best games. Check it out at fb.gg/play. All games are free to play, and available to play instantly with no installs required — including all of the games we’ve discussed here in this blog. *As of October 2020, cloud games were only available in California, Texas and Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states including Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia and West Virginia."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/portraits-of-pride/","date":"2021-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Portraits of Pride","text":""},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/new-ways-to-shop-for-products-you-love-across-our-apps/","date":"2021-06-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Economic Opportunity","Facebook","Instagram","Messenger","Meta","Product News","WhatsApp"],"title":"New Ways to Shop for Products You Love Across Our Apps","text":"Shops is expanding to WhatsApp and Marketplace . Shops ads solutions will help businesses personalize the shopping journey. New technologies like Instagram visual search and AR Dynamic Ads will power the future of shopping. Today, we’re announcing new ways to shop across our apps, along with solutions for businesses to personalize shopping with ads, and investments in technologies that will shape the shopping experiences of tomorrow. The way people shop has changed in the last few decades — from visiting malls, to buying online and now virtually trying on sunglasses from your couch. Commerce has been part of Facebook’s DNA for years, with retail brands using personalized ads to reach customers. Last year, when COVID-19 shut down local economies, we accelerated the launch of Shops to help businesses sell online. We believe the shift to online, social-first shopping is not temporary. One in three shoppers globally say they plan to spend less time in-store even after the pandemic is over, and almost three-quarters say they get shopping ideas from Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp. We’ll continue to support economic recovery by making further investments in Shops and waiving fees for business sellers through June 2022. Bringing Shops to More People Today, we have over 300 million monthly Shops visitors and over 1.2 million monthly active Shops. Now, we’re making it even easier for people to discover and buy from Shops. Soon, we’ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp. In the US, we’ll enable them to bring Shops products into Marketplace, helping them reach the more than 1 billion people globally who visit each month. Shoppers want to feel confident in the purchases they make, so we’re giving people more information before they buy. Over the next few months we’ll expand ratings and reviews to products in Shops on Instagram. Soon you’ll see photos and videos from the community, too. These changes will help people make more informed decisions on what to buy, and will let businesses know if they are meeting customer expectations. Personalizing the Shopping Journey With Ads Businesses want to offer shopping experiences that are seamless and relevant and we want to provide a shopping experience that is as personalized as your News Feed. That’s why we’re introducing Shops ads solutions that provide unique ads experiences based on people’s shopping preferences. For example, we’re testing the ability for businesses to send shoppers to where they are most likely to make a purchase based on their shopping behavior, such as curated products that you might be interested in from a Shop or a business’ website. In the future, we’ll explore ways to help brands further personalize their Shops ads by providing special offers or promotions to select shoppers. This builds on existing tools for business that help them find the right audience like Shopping Custom Audiences and ads with product tags, which enable businesses to send people to their Shop directly from an ad. Together, this suite of personalized Shops ads solutions can help businesses move customers from discovery to purchase. Introducing New Technologies to Power the Future of Shopping We’re investing in immersive technologies like augmented reality and artificial intelligence that will be the foundation for the way we shop online going forward. With new visual discovery tools on Instagram, we’re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences we’re helping people visualize items before they buy. On Instagram, shopping begins with visual discovery. Every day, people scroll through the app and see thumb-stopping inspiration, which becomes a jumping off point for the shopping journey. This year we’ll start testing a new visual search powered by AI. Visual search helps people find similar products – like floral print dresses – just by tapping on an image of a dress they like. In the future we’ll make it possible for people to take photos from their camera to start a visual search. While it’s still early, we think visual search will enhance mobile shopping by making even more pieces of media on Instagram shoppable. Even as brick and mortar re-open in many countries, two-thirds of online shoppers say that they want to virtually try on products from the comfort of their home. To help shoppers get a better feel for the fit of a product before they purchase, we’re making it easier for brands to create AR try-on experiences in Shops through new API integrations with Modiface and Perfect Corp. We’re also introducing new tools for brands to include AR product catalogs in ads that will automatically show relevant products to people based on their interests. We’re also bringing some of the biggest brands together to experiment with Live Shopping on Facebook and bringing this personalized shopping experience to viewers through Live Shopping Fridays. Today’s updates are part of our ongoing work to make shopping easier on our apps and support a stronger economy for everyone."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-on-facebook/","date":"2021-06-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Live Audio Rooms and Podcasts on Facebook","text":"Today we’re rolling out Live Audio Rooms and podcasts, as part of our plans to bring social audio experiences to Facebook. Public figures and select Facebook Groups in the US can create Live Audio Rooms on iOS, and select podcasts will be available to listeners in the US. In the coming weeks, we’ll expand the ability for more public figures and Groups to host a Live Audio Room and introduce new features for both experiences in the coming months. Live Audio Rooms Live Audio Rooms on Facebook enable you to discover, listen in on and join live conversations with public figures, experts and others about topics you’re interested in. Public figures can invite friends, followers, verified public figures, or any listeners in the room to be a speaker. The host can invite speakers in advance or during the conversation. There can be up to 50 speakers, and there’s no limit to the number of listeners. In Groups, admins can control whether moderators, group members or other admins can create a Live Audio Room. In public Groups, both members and visitors can listen to the Live Audio Room, but in private Groups, only members can listen. Live Audio Room hosts can also select a nonprofit or fundraiser to support during their conversation, and listeners and speakers can directly donate. For illustrative purposes only People on iOS and Android can discover Live Audio Rooms to join from places like News Feed and via notifications. You can also sign up to be reminded when a Live Audio Room you’re interested in goes live. When listening to a conversation, you’ll be notified when friends or followers join, too. You can enable live captions, “raise a hand” to request to join the conversation, and use reactions to participate in real time. Listeners can also offer support and show appreciation to the public figure host of the Live Audio Room by sending Stars, which bumps those listeners up to the “front row.” The “front row” is a special section that highlights people who sent Stars, so hosts can recognize supporters (and maybe even give them a shout out during the conversation!). Listeners can purchase Stars packs during the conversation and send them anytime. Discover Conversations About Topics You Care About We’ve partnered with some incredible public figures to roll out Live Audio Rooms. Here’s a preview of some key creators and topics, with more coming soon: Grammy-nominated electronic music artist TOKiMONSTA will discuss female excellence and overcoming obstacles American football quarterback Russell Wilson will talk about how to train your mind like an elite athlete Organizer, producer, independent journalist and scholar-activist Rosa Clemente will host a discussion around affirming Blackness in the Latinx community Hear what it’s like to live the life of a professional esports player in a Live Audio Room hosted by streamer, entertainer, and internet personality Omareloff Social entrepreneur Amanda Nguyen will speak with fellow changemakers about pursuing justice and making progress in an extraordinarily polarized time And that’s just the beginning. You can expect to see Live Audio Rooms from other public figures, too, from D Smoke, Kehlani, Reggie Watts, and Lisa Morales Duke, to Dr. Jess, Bobby Berk, Tina Knowles-Lawson, Joe Budden, and DeRay Mckesson. Additionally, you’ll be able to discover and join Live Audio Rooms within Facebook Groups. There will be conversations ranging a variety of topics from learning how dance can help your mental health with the Dance Accepts Everyone group, to finding the best vegan spots across America in a conversation with the Vegan Soul Food group. You can even join a guided meditation within the Meditation Matters group. There will also be Live Audio Rooms hosted by groups like Pow Wow Nation, OctoNation® – The Largest Octopus Fan Club!, and Space Hipsters. No matter what you’re passionate about, there’s a Live Audio Room waiting for you. Podcasts To start, the initial slate of podcasts will include Joe Budden of The Joe Budden Podcast; “Jess Hilarious” of Carefully Reckless from The Black Effect Podcast Network and iHeartRadio; Keltie Knight, Becca Tobin, and Jac Vanek of the LadyGang; and Nicaila Matthews Okome of Side Hustle Pro. We’ll continue to add more podcasts in the coming weeks. People can listen to podcasts while browsing Facebook, via a miniplayer or full-screen player experience with playback options, including with their phone display turned off. People can listen to select podcast creators on their Facebook Pages, as well as in News Feed. You’ll have access to a diverse catalog of podcasts and be able to react to, comment, bookmark and share your favorite podcasts. Later this summer, we’ll roll out additional features, like captions and the ability to create and share short clips of a podcast. Over time, we’ll build more unique social experiences around podcasts that make use of Facebook’s best interactive and personalized features. Looking Ahead Live Audio Rooms and podcasts rolling out in the US is just the beginning of our audio journey. Looking ahead, we are working with creators who will use our audio tools to further develop and launch Soundbites — short-form, creative audio clips. We are excited to partner with this community to refine the Soundbites experience before it launches later this year. We’ll also soon start testing our other audio products like the central listening destination and background audio listening for videos."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/improving-digital-security-in-poland/","date":"2021-06-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","EMEA"],"title":"Improving Digital Security in Poland","text":"According to a Facebook-conducted poll, 78% of Poles are concerned about the risk of having their social media accounts hacked, but only 30% of them use two-factor authentication.

There are more than 70 million admins and moderators running active Facebook groups around the world, and what they do every day is at the heart of Facebook’s mission of building community and bringing the world closer together. In fact, four years ago this month, we held our first Facebook Communities Summit in Chicago, where we announced this updated company mission with hundreds of group admins, and shared new features to nurture their communities on Facebook. We’ve continued to support them in the years since and here are the new tools we’re rolling out. Admin Home, a New One-Stop Shop to Manage Your Community Admin Home is a simpler, more intuitive destination for all admin tools, settings and features that admins can tailor to their needs. With the new experience, admins can: Quickly see what needs attention across posts, members and reported comments. Find key tools they’re looking for through a clearer, reorganized layout that shows what’s available under each category. Access new features that are rolled out in the future. New Tools to Help Moderate Conversations and Potential Conflict Keeping Facebook groups safe is a priority and admins play a key role in helping maintain a safe and healthy culture within their communities. We’re introducing comment moderation to Admin Assist, allowing admins to set up criteria to automatically moderate both posts and comments. Now available across desktop and mobile, admins have the ability to: Restrict people who don’t qualify to participate based on several options, such as how long they’ve had a Facebook account or how long they have been a member of the group. Reduce promotional content by declining posts and comments with specific links, with the ability to provide feedback for the author, so they can edit their post and re-submit it for review. Use suggested criteria from Facebook to help defend the group against spam, maintain positive discussions and resolve conflicts within the group. Admins can browse, add and edit that criteria to meet the needs of their group. Admins have the option to undo specific actions from Admin Assist, or to change and refine criteria over time. We’re also testing a new type of Moderation Alert called Conflict Alerts. This uses AI to detect and notify admins when there may be contentious or unhealthy conversations in their group, so they can take action as needed. In situations where it may be helpful to slow down a conversation, admins can temporarily limit how often specific group members can comment, and control how often comments can be made on certain posts that admins select. Admin Assist Comment Slowdown Conflict Alerts New Ways for Community Builders to Reinforce Community Culture It’s important for admins to be able to set, shape and reinforce a community’s culture. Understanding who their members are and setting clear rules and norms for the community to follow is at the center of that. We’re introducing a new member summary feature so that admins can see a consolidated summary of each group member’s activity in the group, such as the number of times they have posted and commented, or when they’ve had posts removed or been muted in the group. Admins can now appeal violations for content they or other admins posted, or that they approved from members, as well as content from members. These appeals will be reviewed by Facebook to make sure the right decision was made. To help make it easier to share and enforce rules in Groups, admins and moderators can now tag group rules in comments and posts. Members can also tag specific group rules when they report posts and comments to admins, helping make community moderation simpler. Over the last few months, we’ve also made several updates to our admin tools based on specific feedback we’ve heard from our admin community. This includes features like pinned comments, admin announcement notifications, and a range of other features you can read about in our Community Blog.

In Brazil and India, the share of donors at blood banks who said that they were influenced by a Facebook notification to donate blood increased from 0% to 14% in the first year. Since we first launched the Blood Donations feature in India in 2017, we have expanded to 37 countries — now including Australia, Colombia, Israel, Singapore and Tunisia as of today.

We’ve also introduced a way for people to discover nearby blood donation events through the Blood Donations feature. Now blood donation centers can share their donation opportunities via Facebook Events, making them easily seen by people who have signed up to receive blood donation notifications. People can RSVP to blood donation events and share with their friends. To commemorate World Blood Donor Day — which was founded by the World Health Organization to thank blood donors and to raise awareness of the need for regular blood donations — we hosted the Global Forum on Blood Donations with our partners on June 10.

More Context For Pages That Repeatedly Share False Claims We want to give people more information before they like a Page that has repeatedly shared content that fact-checkers have rated, so you’ll see a pop up if you go to like one of these Pages. You can also click to learn more, including that fact-checkers said some posts shared by this Page include false information and a link to more information about our fact-checking program. This will help people make an informed decision about whether they want to follow the Page. Expanding Penalties For Individual Facebook Accounts Since launching our fact-checking program in late 2016, our focus has been on reducing viral misinformation. We’ve taken stronger action against Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts and domains sharing misinformation and now, we’re expanding some of these efforts to include penalties for individual Facebook accounts too. Starting today, we will reduce the distribution of all posts in News Feed from an individual’s Facebook account if they repeatedly share content that has been rated by one of our fact-checking partners. We already reduce a single post’s reach in News Feed if it has been debunked. Redesigned Notifications When People Share Fact-Checked Content We currently notify people when they share content that a fact-checker later rates, and now we’ve redesigned these notifications to make it easier to understand when this happens. The notification includes the fact-checker’s article debunking the claim as well as a prompt to share the article with their followers. It also includes a notice that people who repeatedly share false information may have their posts moved lower in News Feed so other people are less likely to see them."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/community-standards-enforcement-report-q1-2021/","date":"2021-05-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Community Standards Enforcement Report, First Quarter 2021","text":"In addition to our Community Standards Enforcement Report, this quarter we’re also sharing: Our new Transparency Center, providing a single destination for our integrity and transparency efforts Our biannual Transparency Report that shares information on government requests for user data, content restrictions based on local laws, intellectual property takedowns and internet disruptions New numbers on data scraping Recent updates on recommendations from the Oversight Board Today we’re publishing our Community Standards Enforcement Report for the first quarter of 2021. This report provides metrics on how we enforced our policies from January through March, including metrics across 12 policies on Facebook and 10 on Instagram. The new Transparency Center is a single destination for our integrity and transparency efforts. It includes information on: Our policies and how they are developed and updated Our approach to enforcing these content policies, using reviewers and technology Deep dives on how we work to safeguard elections and combat misinformation Reports sharing data on our efforts We’ll continue to add more information and build out the Transparency Center as our integrity efforts continue to evolve. Last year we committed to undergoing an independent audit to validate that our metrics are measured and reported correctly. We have selected EY to conduct this assessment, and we look forward to working with them. Community Standards Enforcement Report Highlights Prevalence is one of the most useful metrics for understanding how often people see harmful content on our platform, so in this report, we’re expanding prevalence metrics on Instagram to include the prevalence of adult nudity and violent and graphic content. In Q1 of 2021, the prevalence of adult nudity on both Facebook and Instagram was 0.03-0.04%. Violent and graphic content prevalence was 0.01-0.02% on Instagram. On Facebook, it was 0.03-0.04%, down from .05% last quarter. We’re working to share more data and match the metrics we share across both Facebook and Instagram. That’s why we’re releasing these prevalence numbers for the first time, and we’ll continue to share them each quarter to track our progress. Progress on Hate Speech Prevalence of hate speech on Facebook continues to decrease. In Q1, it was 0.05-0.06%, or 5 to 6 views per 10,000 views. We evaluate the effectiveness of our enforcement by trying to keep the prevalence of hate speech on our platform as low as possible, while minimizing mistakes in the content that we remove. This improvement in prevalence on Facebook is due to changes we made to reduce problematic content in News Feed. Advancements in AI technologies have allowed us to remove more hate speech from Facebook over time, and find more of it before users report it to us. When we first began reporting our metrics on hate speech in Q4 of 2017, our proactive detection rate was 23.6%. This means that of the hate speech we removed, 23.6% of it was found before a user reported it to us. The remaining majority of it was removed after a user reported it. Today we proactively detect about 97% of hate speech content we remove. Recent Trends In addition to new metrics and ongoing improvements in prevalence, we saw steady numbers on the content we took action on across many problem areas. On Facebook in Q1 we took action on: 8.8 million pieces of bullying and harassment content, up from 6.3 million in Q4 2020 due in part to improvements in our proactive detection technology 9.8 million pieces of organized hate content, up from 6.4 million in Q4 2020 25.2 million pieces of hate speech content, compared to 26.9 million in Q4 2020 On Instagram in Q1 we took action on: 5.5 million pieces of bullying and harassment content, up from 5 million in Q4 2020 due in part to improvements in our proactive detection technology 324,500 pieces of organized hate content, up from 308,000 in Q4 2020 6.3 million pieces of hate speech content, compared to 6.6 million in Q4 2020 Combating COVID-19 Misinformation and Harmful Content COVID-19 continues to be a major public health issue, and we are committed to helping people get authoritative information, including vaccine information. From the start of the pandemic to April 2021, we removed more than 18 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram globally for violating our policies on COVID-19-related misinformation and harm. We’re also working to increase vaccine acceptance and combat vaccine misinformation."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/introducing-your-new-favorite-way-to-shop-live-shopping-fridays/","date":"2021-05-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Live Shopping Fridays","text":"What if you could see this season’s latest trends modeled in real time, ask questions about how they fit, select your size and buy, all from the comfort of your home?

Facebook Neighborhoods is a dedicated space within the Facebook app designed to help you connect with your neighbors, participate in your local community and discover new places nearby. People have always used Facebook to connect with their neighbors — rallying to support local businesses, asking for recommendations and tips in local groups, offering support, or meeting neighbors who share common interests. Throughout the pandemic and especially in the past year, we’ve seen just how crucial these connections can be. Facebook Neighborhoods makes it easier to do this, bringing the local experience across Facebook into one place. How it Works Facebook Neighborhoods is a section of the Facebook app dedicated to your neighborhood, with a Neighborhoods profile that’s different from your main Facebook profile. To join, you’ll need to be 18 years or older and confirm your neighborhood. You can choose to join just your own neighborhood or, in addition, you also have the option to join your Nearby Neighborhoods to see neighbors and posts from your surrounding neighborhoods. Meet and Connect With Your Neighbors When you create your Neighborhoods profile, you can choose to add interests, favorite places and a bio so people can get to know you within the Neighborhoods Directory. You can write a post to introduce yourself, participate in discussions on posts from fellow neighbors and answer Neighborhoods Questions in the dedicated feed. People can also take on roles within Neighborhoods, including socializers who spark friendly conversations. Engage with Local Groups You can find vibrant local Facebook groups about your area, or you can create your own Neighborhoods-bounded groups based on your interests. Admins of local Facebook Groups can add their Group into Neighborhoods to make it easy for people living nearby to find it, and people using Neighborhoods can create or join Neighborhoods-bounded groups that are accessible within the Neighborhoods experience. You can create Neighborhoods groups for local bird watchers, or discuss last night’s game with fellow basketball lovers in your area. Discover New Places and Get Local Recommendations If you’re looking for advice on where to get the best coffee or a locksmith in the area, you can use the Recommendations feature in Neighborhoods to get suggestions from your local community. Also, the Neighborhoods Favorite Polls allow neighbors to vote on their favorite places and businesses in the area, including restaurants, parks and more. Moderation and Safety We built Neighborhoods to be safe and inclusive, with Neighborhoods Guidelines to help keep interactions among neighbors relevant and kind. Neighborhoods have moderators who use these Guidelines to review posts and comments in the Neighborhoods feed. If a post or comment appears to go against the Neighborhoods Guidelines, moderators can take action by hiding the post, which will then be reviewed by Facebook Community Operations. If the post violates Facebook Community Standards, the post will be removed from Neighborhoods. You can also report a post or comment to a Neighborhoods moderator or via Facebook’s reporting tool if you believe it doesn’t follow the Guidelines or Facebook’s Community Standards. You can block someone on Facebook or Neighborhoods and we won’t inform them. When someone you’ve blocked is logged into Facebook, they won’t be able to find you in the Neighborhoods directory. Privacy Neighborhoods is an opt-in experience within the Facebook app so you choose whether to join Neighborhoods and create a profile. Once you join Neighborhoods, you can decide whether to join just your neighborhood or also your Nearby Neighborhoods. Your Neighborhoods profile includes your name, profile and cover photo from your Facebook profile and the name of your neighborhood. You can also add optional information to your profile, such as a bio. When you join your own Neighborhood, these neighbors will be able to see your posts and Neighborhoods profile, including the name of your neighborhood. If you decide to join your Nearby Neighborhoods as well, these additional neighbors will also see this information. When you create a group in Neighborhoods, it can be private or open and visible or hidden. If your Neighborhood Group is private, only members of the group who have joined the neighborhood can see posts. If the group is open, anyone in the neighborhood or Nearby Neighborhoods (if Nearby Neighborhoods is selected) can see who’s in the group and what they post. If the group is visible, anyone in the neighborhood can search for and find this group. If the group is hidden, only members can find the group. Your activity and information in Neighborhoods may be used to personalize your experience across Facebook Products, including ads you may see. This means that your activity on Facebook may influence what you see in Neighborhoods, and your activity in Neighborhoods may influence what you see elsewhere on Facebook Products. Learn more about how we collect, use and share your data in the Facebook Data Policy. You can access your Neighborhoods data in our Access Your Information and Download Your Information tools. Availability This feature is currently available in Canada, and will begin to roll out to select US cities soon."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/mental-health-awareness-month/","date":"2021-05-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Messenger","Meta","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Making Emotional Health a Priority This Mental Health Awareness Month","text":"According to a recent study by the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has exacerbated mental health challenges globally, while disrupting or halting critical mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide. As the pandemic continues to impact emotional health, we’re partnering with leading mental health experts around the world to offer support and provide new resources. We’re also encouraging people to check in with each other throughout the month, and beyond. Checking In: It’s Been A Year: Across our apps, we’re elevating the voices of people triumphing over the challenges of the past year. The pandemic has taken a toll on mental health, and checking in on someone can often make a difference. You can get involved by checking in with family, friends or someone you know who is struggling. Together, we can remind people they’re not alone, and that it’s ok if you don’t feel ok. Check In With A Friend: It takes less than a minute to check in and show someone you care. The “Let’s Talk” sticker pack on Messenger, developed with input from the World Health Organization, can help start the conversation when words are hard to find. You can also find mental health resources and tools through Messenger’s partner organizations. Get Inspired: Watch new episodes of the Mental Health Coalition’s ‘121’ series on Instagram Live featuring advocates and mental health clinicians including Deepak Chopra, Carson Daly, Julianne Hough, Jewel, Kesha, Kevin Love, Michelle Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and more. New episodes will air throughout the month showing how managing mental health starts with checking in with yourself and others. New Resources and Tips: Emotional Health Updates: Check out our new guide developed by the Mental Health Coalition, The JED Foundation, and American Foundation for Suicide Prevention on Offering Support to a Friend in Emotional Health on Facebook. You can also find new resources from mental health organizations and advocates. Make emotional health a priority by checking in with yourself every day and getting inspired by all the ways to take a #MentalHealthMinute. Instagram Reels Campaign with the The Jed Foundation: We know young people can feel pressure to look a certain way or compare themselves to others on social media. In partnership with The Jed Foundation, we’re creating a series of Instagram Reels with creators to share tips and ways teens can manage social comparison. We’ve consulted with Dr. Phillippa Diedrichs from the Centre for Appearance Research and other global mental health organizations to provide guidance on the Reels. Creators participating in the campaign include @pinkmantaray, @bunnymichael, @Ohhappydani, @afffirmations, @spencer.barbosa and @jessiamusic. @Instagram Guide on Social Comparison: We also launched a new guide on @instagram with artwork by @nubiartuk to help people understand how different experiences online make them feel. It includes tips and resources from well-being creators, experts and advocates on how to make your experience on social media more positive and uplifting. These efforts build on our ongoing investment to help keep people safe, informed and connected to mental health resources as they continue to navigate the pandemic, and beyond. As we process the residual mental health effects of COVID-19 and other events of the past year, we hope people will remember to check in and support each other every step of the way."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/supporting-the-asian-and-pacific-islander-community/","date":"2021-05-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Messenger","Meta","Strengthening Communities","WhatsApp"],"title":"Supporting the Asian and Pacific Islander Community","text":"This Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, we’re celebrating the diversity and impact of Asians and Pacific Islanders (API) while also raising awareness of issues the community has faced for decades. With the rise in hate crimes and discrimination toward Asians and Pacific Islanders during the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve also seen people come together on our apps to create positive change, promote allyship and educate others through movements like #StopAsianHate. This month and beyond, we’re amplifying API voices, celebrating the vibrancy and impact of the community, and sharing new ways we’re providing support. How Facebook Is Supporting the API Community Last year, we invested $10 million in racial justice grants, and today we’re expanding this investment with an additional $5 million donation that will go to organizations focused on racial justice and equity for the Asian and Pacific Islander community and other marginalized communities. And to make sure the API community feels safe and supported on our apps, we’re expanding our comment warning features on Facebook to encourage people to reconsider harmful language and provide education around how that language may impact the API community and others. We’re also hosting a series of Amplify API events throughout the week of May 17 to bring together business founders, community leaders and media figures to discuss challenges the API community is facing, how Asians and Pacific Islanders are represented in media and culture, and provide training and advice for API-owned SMBs. Given the recent rise in anti-Asian racism and the negative impact it has on mental health, we’re partnering with organizations such as Asian American Psychological Association, South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), Asian Mental Health Project and others to help people have conversations about mental health and encourage everyone to take a #MentalHealthMinute. Lastly, throughout the month we’re using the Facebook company, Facebook app and Instagram social channels to elevate the stories of API community members coming together to celebrate their unique identities and dismantle stereotypes. How You Can Celebrate and Support Raise funds for API causes: Throughout the month, people in the US will see a #StopAsianHate notification at the top of News Feed that you can tap to donate to API organizations combating hate and discrimination. Share your support: We’re adding new ways to express yourself and share your support across our apps including new stickers and avatar expressions on Facebook and new AR/VR filters and stickers on Instagram designed in collaboration with artist Dingding Hu. On Messenger you can check out a new set of camera stickers to share with your friends and on WhatsApp you can share stickers designed by illustrator Gracia Lam that highlight the strength of women from Asia and the Pacific Islands. Shop API-owned businesses: Explore our API-owned business Shop collections and Shops You May Like feature on the Facebook app, as well as @shop on Instagram to discover and support API-owned businesses. In addition, Sheryl Sandberg will host an Instagram Live Rooms discussion on May 5 with three API small business owners to discuss the cultural significance of their businesses. Tune in at @sherylsandberg.

And Facebook Watch will be the exclusive streaming partner for “See Us Unite for Change,” a celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage. This first-of-its-kind special will be hosted by Ken Jeong and feature Asian American and Pacific Islander celebrities and allies who will educate viewers about the community’s impact in America, as well as how to move forward and build solidarity against hate. The event will be hosted by the Board of The Asian American Foundation (TAAF) in partnership with the Ford and MacArthur Foundations and produced by Sheila Lirio Marcelo, a TAAF board member, Jesse Collins, Kimmie Kim and Carol Donovan of Jesse Collins Entertainment with MTV Entertainment Studios."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/incorporating-more-feedback-into-news-feed-ranking/","date":"2021-04-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Incorporating More Feedback Into News Feed Ranking","text":"Our goal with News Feed is to arrange the posts from friends, Groups and Pages you follow to show you what matters most to you at the top of your feed. Our algorithm uses thousands of signals to rank posts for your News Feed with this goal in mind. This spring, we’re expanding on our work to use direct feedback from people who use Facebook to understand the content people find most valuable. And we’ll continue to incorporate this feedback into our News Feed ranking process. Expanding on “Worth Your Time” Surveys In 2019, we introduced surveys to ask people, “Is this post worth your time?” and we use that feedback to inform how we arrange posts in their News Feed going forward. For example, if people say a post is worth their time, we’ll aim to show posts like that higher in News Feed, and if it isn’t worth their time, we’ll aim to show posts like that closer to the bottom. We also use surveys to better understand how meaningful different friends, Pages, and Groups are to people, and ranking algorithms are updated based on the responses. While a post’s engagement — or how often people like it, comment on it, or share it — can be a helpful indicator that it’s interesting to people, this survey-driven approach, which largely occurs outside the immediate reaction to a post, gives a more complete picture of the types of posts people find most valuable and what kind of content detracts from their News Feed experience. Now, we’re building on these surveys by asking new questions about the content people find valuable as well as the content people don’t enjoy seeing in their News Feed. Exploring More Feedback-Driven Signals Over the next few months, we’ll test new ways to get more specific feedback from people about the posts they’re seeing, and we’ll use that feedback to make News Feed better. Here are some of the new approaches we’re exploring: Whether people find a post inspirational: People have told us they want to see more inspiring and uplifting content in News Feed because it motivates them and can be useful to them outside of Facebook. For example, a post featuring a quote about community can inspire someone to spend more time volunteering, or a photo of a national park can inspire someone to spend more time in nature. To this end, we’re running a series of global tests that will survey people to understand which posts they find inspirational. We’ll incorporate their responses as a signal in News Feed ranking, with the goal of showing people more inspirational posts closer to the top of their News Feed. Gauging interest in certain topics: Even though your News Feed contains posts from the friends, Groups and Pages you’ve chosen to follow, we know sometimes even your closest friends and family share posts about topics that aren’t really interesting to you, or that you don’t want to see. To address this, we’ll ask people whether they want to see more or fewer posts about a certain topic, such as Cooking, Sports or Politics, and based on their collective feedback, we’ll aim to show people more content about the topics they’re more interested in, and show them fewer posts about topics they don’t want to see. Better understanding content people want to see less of: Increasingly, we’re hearing feedback from people that they’re seeing too much content about politics and too many other kinds of posts and comments that detract from their News Feed experience. This is a sensitive area, so over the next few months, we’ll work to better understand what kinds of content are linked with these negative experiences. For example, we’ll look at posts with lots of angry reactions and ask people what kinds of posts they may want to see less of. Making it easier to give feedback directly on a post: We’ve long given people the ability to hide a particular post they encounter in News Feed, and we’ll soon test a new post design to make this option even more prominent. If you come across something that you find irrelevant, problematic or irritating, you can tap the X in the upper right corner of the post to hide it from your News Feed and see fewer posts like it in the future. Updated on September 13, 2021 at 2:30PM PT: We’ve now fully launched the hide and see less of X. Overall, we hope to show people more content they want to see and find valuable, and less of what they don’t. While engagement will continue to be one of many types of signals we use to rank posts in News Feed, we believe these additional insights can provide a more complete picture of the content people find valuable, and we’ll share more as we learn from these tests."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/","date":"2021-04-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Be Heard: Bringing Social Audio Experiences to Facebook","text":"Storytelling helps people build meaningful bonds: we all have stories to share with our friends, our communities, and the world at large. Speech, sound, and language are the building blocks for how we connect with each other. That’s why good audio experiences can feel immersive and intimate at the same time. They make you feel like you’re right there in the room with your friends and family, sitting around at the dining table, even if you’re miles apart. Audio seamlessly fits within our busy lives, allows us to be inspired by new ideas, and talk with other like-minded people without pressure. You can share your personal story or join in on a global conversation in any way, anytime, anywhere — even on a bad hair day without any makeup — or in your car or on a run! At Facebook, we’ve seen the continuing rise of audio on our platforms, from audio calls to audio messages on WhatsApp and Messenger. We’re working to make audio messages easier to record, and more fun — including the ability for people to send familiar sound clips to their friends that range from sound effects like crickets chirping to quotes from popular songs. But we know there are more social experiences to create to help people say what they want to say, discover new voices they haven’t heard before, or exchange ideas at the speed of sound. Right now, it’s still too difficult for most people to do any of this. The best audio creation tools are reserved for the pros. It’s still too hard to discover and share awesome audio content, and too cumbersome to assemble the right group of people to have a conversation about your favorite topic, at the right time. At Facebook, we’ve invested in the full spectrum of audio technologies to solve these problems. From audio quality enhancements, captions, speech translations, and superhuman hearing, our goal is to make audio presence easy, natural, and immersive so you can more fully experience social presence. Whether it’s an in-depth conversation or your passing thoughts, we are building audio tools and formats that connect people with the things they care about. A Sound Studio in Your Pocket The first thing we’re building is a set of new audio creation tools. Just like we did for photos and videos, we want everyone to have tools that are powerful enough for the pros, but intuitive and fun — like having a sound studio in your pocket. We’ve been investing in audio technologies — such as speech-to-text and voice morphing — for a long time and will make them available in an audio creation tool directly inside the Facebook app. Through our advances in AI, we can make audio quality magically great — even if you record on a busy street corner. You will be able to use music from Facebook’s Sound Collection in the background of your story to set the tone. And with the ability to mix audio tracks, a growing collection of sound effects, voice effects and filters, it should be a lot of fun too. Soundbites: A New Social Audio Format These audio creation tools will enable you to create Soundbites — short-form, creative audio clips for capturing anecdotes, jokes, moments of inspiration, poems, and many other things we haven’t yet imagined. We’ll start testing Soundbites over the next few months with a small number of creators and refine the product with their input before making it available to everyone. To start, we’re collaborating with creators to experiment with different concepts. Imagine, comedian Drew Lynch, sharing his short rants and food reviews in ASMR; Lolo Spencer, an accessibility advocate, reciting daily affirmations and her favorite inspirational quotes; Tobe Nwigwe, a visionary and entrepreneur, sharing his “convos with Tobe” about fatherhood and being a first-generation Nigerian American; Molly Burke, a motivational speaker who is blind, recording empowering stories about overcoming adversity; and Josh Sundquist, an author and comedian, using voice effects to augment his impersonations and storytelling. The possibilities are endless and we can’t wait to hear their Soundbites. Podcasts Are Coming to Facebook While we’re big believers in the power of short-form audio, we also know that some stories and conversations deserve more airtime. More than 170 million people are already connected to hundreds of thousands of podcast pages on Facebook, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around podcasts — but until now, you had to leave the Facebook app to listen to these episodes. Within the next few months, you’ll be able to listen to podcasts directly on the Facebook app — both while using the app or when the app is backgrounded. And because it’s still hard to discover podcasts you like, we will help you easily find new podcasts and episodes based on your interests, comment on them and recommend them to your friends. And podcast creators will be able to reach and connect with new listeners — all directly within the Facebook app. Live Audio Rooms in Facebook and Messenger We’re also going to start testing Live Audio Rooms and we expect it to be available to everyone on the Facebook app by the summer. We believe that audio is a perfect way for communities to engage around topics they care about. We’ll test Live Audio Rooms in Groups, making it available to the 1.8 billion people using Groups every month and the tens of millions of active communities on Facebook. Whether it’s Filipino Cooking Group, run by a former cooking reality TV show contestant; the World Wanderlust Bucket List group, filled with travelers looking for the road less traveled; or OctoNation® – The Largest Octopus Fan Club of 47,000 cephalopod enthusiasts, we hope that unlocking audio will be as inspiring and fun as Groups already are. As part of this initial rollout — and because we know communities aren’t built just in Groups — we’ll also bring Live Audio Rooms to public figures so they can host conversations with other public figures, experts and fans. We’re making live audio both accessible and discoverable so that public figures like American football quarterback Russell Wilson, Grammy-nominated electronic music artist TOKiMONSTA, artist and director Elle Moxley, and five-time Olympic medalist and entrepreneur Nastia Liukin can share ideas with new audiences and create a forum for discussion, without the added pressure of being on camera. In addition to bringing this to Facebook, we also plan to release Live Audio Rooms on Messenger this summer so you can easily hang out with your friends, too. Everything Is Being Built to Work Together and Be Accessible to All We think a lot of magic happens at the intersection of audio formats, as well as at the confluence of text, audio, and video. For example, with live audio, creators will be able to turn a live conversation into a podcast for everyone to listen to later. We also want to give creators and fans tools to share the best excerpts from a live audio or podcast and publish them as Soundbites to encourage more discussion. Additionally, we’re going to offer captions on all these audio experiences to make them accessible to all. And if you have the sound off or prefer to follow along with text, you will be able to access this universe of content on your terms. Similarly, if you’re on the go, we will also make it easy to listen to most videos in the background. Over time, all these different formats will live in a central listening destination on Facebook where people can find new things and new people to listen to. Monetization Opportunities The only way this all works long term is if creators can make money from their efforts. So at launch, we’re introducing multiple ways for audio creators to build their business while pursuing their passion. When Live Audio Rooms launch, fans will be able to support their favorite creators and public figures through Stars, or donate to causes they care about. Soon after launch, we’ll also offer other monetization models, like the ability to charge for access to a Live Audio Room through a single purchase or a subscription. Finally, to kickstart Soundbites, we’re introducing an Audio Creator Fund to support emerging audio creators and get early feedback on the new product experience. We’ve seen time and again just how much creative energy is liberated when you build powerful creation and editing tools, make them free and easy to use, and — with appropriate safety and privacy safeguards — put them out into the world. By bringing the magic to new audio formats, we’re giving people a new way to say more of what they’ve always wanted to say, this whole time. P.S.

Every day, more vaccine appointments become available in the US, and people are coming together on Facebook to help each other get vaccinated. That starts with booking an appointment. A group of teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland have gone through every detail of their local vaccine appointment website and are helping people schedule their shots. But true to their profession, they’re also sharing their knowledge to empower others to book their own appointments. And they’re focusing on helping people in underserved communities most impacted by COVID-19. They started the Vaccine Hunters Las Caza Vacunas group on Facebook to share tips, and now doctors are even referring patients to the group. They’ve also helped Montgomery County officials proofread and correct Spanish translation errors on the County’s website to avoid confusion and help everyone get the COVID-19 vaccine information they need. In Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, Gene Davis founded DFW Covid Vaccine Finder after helping his elderly parents get vaccinated. The group shares information on where eligible people in the area can get their shots, and they’ve helped schedule appointments for thousands of people. One volunteer was able to get every elderly member of her church vaccinated thanks to information shared in the group. When Katherine Quirk and Russell Schwartz thought of their grandparents scheduling vaccine appointments online, they realized that many people may not have the computer skills, or access, necessary to find and book vaccination appointments. So they started the South Florida COVID-19 Vaccination Info group on Facebook and have helped schedule thousands of appointments. In three months, the group has grown to over 40,000 members and includes people outside of Florida as well. Members in New York are using the group to help their parents living in Florida get vaccinated. It’s also inspired others to start similar groups in Pennsylvania, New York and Toronto. Together, we can put COVID-19 behind us."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/state-covid-19-vaccine-information/","date":"2021-04-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Connecting People in the US With State COVID-19 Vaccine Information","text":"Now that states in the US are opening COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to all adults, Facebook is helping connect people with state-specific information from local health departments about COVID-19 vaccines and how people can get vaccinated. To do this, we’re replicating our state-by-state strategies we used during the US 2020 presidential election since both voting and the vaccine rollout are handled by state and local authorities. Just as we ran state-specific notifications in News Feed about registering to vote and voting by mail ahead of each state’s deadlines, we’re tailoring COVID-19 vaccine notifications to coincide with each state opening their eligibility to all adults so we don’t promote vaccines before everyone is eligible. We are ultimately rolling out these notifications nationally across the US and globally as more countries expand vaccinations. Sharing State Vaccine Information in News Feed As part of our work to help people get vaccinated, we’re working with state health departments to connect people with reliable information about whether and when they’re eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine in their state. From January through March, over 3 million people in the US clicked through our News Feed promotions and our COVID-19 Information Center to visit their state health website or local provider. And showing people this information right in their News Feed is having a positive impact on vaccine registrations. For example, West Virginia’s Department of Health and Human Resources reported that their vaccine registrations increased significantly after Facebook started running these notifications. We’re also running these News Feed notifications in nearly 20 countries with more following soon. These notifications link to the country’s ministry of health website for more information about the vaccines and booking an appointment. Since February in the US, we’ve shown people ages 65 and older a notification in News Feed that links to their state website to see who can get a vaccine and how to make an appointment. Now that states are expanding vaccine eligibility, we’re starting to show notifications to all eligible adults with the latest information. When a state says the general public is eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, we’ll show a notification to people in that state that connects them with their state health department or our Vaccine Finder. We’re already doing this in states such as Alaska, Mississippi, Texas and Utah. Our strategy to work closely with state governments is critical in order to ensure that our features are directing people to local resources as they are available and not drive demand too soon that would overwhelm systems. If you have your Facebook language set to Spanish, you’ll see the notification in Spanish and we’ll direct you to your state’s Spanish-language website, if they have one, when you click the link. Right now, we’re running these News Feed notifications in 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and five US territories in English, Spanish, Mandarin and Vietnamese. This information, including links to state health departments, is also available in the COVID-19 Information Center. CrowdTangle Partnerships With Health Departments Over the last month, we’ve given state health departments access to CrowdTangle to help address localized vaccine misinformation in a given state or region. CrowdTangle is a Facebook tool that tracks how content spreads online. When health departments flag potential vaccine misinformation on Facebook and Instagram, we review and remove this content if it violates our policies against false COVID-19 and vaccine claims. This is similar to how governments and fact-checkers use CrowdTangle ahead of elections to identify potential voter suppression. Expanded Access to Facebook Local Alerts Over the past year, local governments have been using local alerts, a tool that helps first responders and local governments communicate urgent information to their community on Facebook, to share COVID-19 updates. To help reach people quickly with vaccine information, we expanded access to local alerts to even more municipal governments, state and local emergency response organizations and public health agencies. These groups now have the ability to push out timely, credible COVID-19 and vaccine information to their local communities. If you meet this criteria, you can request access to Local Alerts."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/celebrating-ramadan-monthofgood/","date":"2021-04-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Messenger","Meta","Strengthening Communities","WhatsApp"],"title":"Celebrating the #MonthofGood","text":"As we begin another Ramadan in the midst of COVID-19, Muslims around the world are honoring classic traditions in new ways by gathering virtually and sharing celebrations online. Last year, our community exchanged more than 20 million “Happy Ramadan” posts and comments on Facebook, and WhatsApp video calls spiked on the first day of Eid. Despite the barriers to coming together in person, Ramadan remains a time for generosity, charity and reflection. In 2020, people contributed twice as much to Ramadan-related fundraisers than they did in 2019 across Facebook and Instagram. This year, we’re inviting the more than 2 billion people observing Ramadan globally to honor this period through #MonthofGood. Starting today, there will be more ways for people to explore, inspire and express good across our apps. Through new resources and features, people can discover ways to show kindness and give back to their communities. People can also share their acts of good and connect with friends and family during the Holy Month. Explore Good To kick off the #MonthofGood, here are a few ideas for how you can start a pay-it-forward chain to share acts of good and inspire others to do the same. Don’t forget to use the hashtag #MonthofGood to help build solidarity in spreading kindness. Those who would like to know more about the month can refer to Sara Sabry’s “Guide to Ramadan,” which has been inspired by her Muslim followers around the world. Inspire Good Throughout the month, we’ll collaborate with creators, communities, publishers and NGOs to spotlight those who are making a positive impact in their communities and inspire others to do the same. On Facebook, UK-based director Basma Khalifa will host a video series to celebrate today’s changemakers and small businesses in the Muslim community. Also, Teen Vogue Director of Fashion and Beauty Features Tahirah Hairston will moderate a panel about modesty in Western culture and inclusion within the fashion industry. On Instagram, creators from around the world will share special moments from their Ramadan celebrations through a series of live videos throughout the month, highlighting a variety of Muslim voices as well as #MonthofGood content on @Instagram, @InstagramforBusiness, @Design, @Shop and @Creators. Additionally, those looking to make charitable donations or fulfill their Zakat during the month can turn to Facebook and Instagram to find nonprofits. Rahma Worldwide, UNHCR, Heroic Hearts, Molham Volunteering Team and Zakat Foundation of America are just a few of the thousands of charities with active Ramadan fundraisers to provide food baskets, supplies and emergency relief to those who need it most around the world. Express Good People can share their acts of good and connect with friends and family during Ramadan with new Instagram stickers designed by @HalaAlAbbasi, and new Whatsapp stickers illustrated by Murat Kalkavan. There will be new avatar stickers available in the Facebook app, as well as new camera effects and stickers on Messenger and Messenger Kids. Also, families and loved ones can get together virtually to watch exclusive Ramadan Facebook Watch and IGTV series from creators such as Khalid Al Ameri, The Food Rangers, Nefis Yemek Tarifleri, Foodies & Spice and networks like MBC and RCTI, just to name a few. And people can tune into Live Suhoor Talks, a global series hosted by creators across the UK, Asia, Middle East and North Africa featuring weekly conversations on topics ranging from food and fasting to mental health and well-being. Wishing our community a very happy Ramadan."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/encourage-your-friends-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine/","date":"2021-03-31T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Encourage Your Friends to Get a COVID-19 Vaccine","text":"Update on December 1, 2021 at 2:50PM PT: As new COVID-19 variants like Delta and Omicron continue to develop, getting a vaccine booster is more important. Today, we’re launching COVID-19 vaccine booster profile frames on Facebook that we developed in collaboration with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In the US, over 60% of people on Facebook have seen someone use a profile frame promoting COVID-19 vaccination, a feature we first developed in collaboration with the HHS and CDC in April. Since launching, more than 40 million people globally have used the vaccination frames. We know people are more likely to get vaccinated when they see the people they trust are getting it too, so these new COVID-19 vaccine booster frames will let you share your support and see others doing the same. Update on April 6, 2021 at 3:10PM PT: Today, we are continuing our global expansion of COVID-19 vaccine profile frames on Facebook. We’re working with UNICEF to launch the frames in eight new countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Philippines and Ukraine. We will continue to launch in more countries in the coming weeks and months. “The faster we can get eligible people vaccinated against COVID-19, the sooner we can protect our health services, save lives and come back together. All of that starts with building trust in vaccines. One of the best ways to convince people that the vaccines are safe is to show them people they know and trust expressing relief, joy and hope at safely getting vaccinated, and Facebook frames are an excellent tool for sharing this social proof. This is why we are pleased that Facebook is taking this initiative to help get the word out in communities all over the world about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.” -Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Partnerships Originally published on April 1, 2021 at 4:00AM PT: Research shows that social norms can have a major impact on people’s attitudes and behaviors when it comes to their health. We know people are more likely to get a vaccine when they see many people they trust are doing it. Today, we’re launching new COVID-19 vaccine profile frames on Facebook that we developed in collaboration with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The new frames will let you share your support for COVID-19 vaccines and see that others you respect and care about are doing the same. In the coming weeks, we’ll show you a summary in your News Feed of your friends, family members and people you follow who are using the COVID-19 vaccine profile frames. Arianna Huffington is one of many public figures we’re partnering with to spread the word about COVID-19 vaccines. This follows our recent profile frame launch in the UK in partnership with National Health Services (NHS). In just a few weeks, a quarter of people on Facebook in the UK have already seen a friend or family member use the NHS COVID-19 vaccine profile frame. By working closely with national and global health authorities and using our scale to reach people quickly, we’re doing our part to help people get credible information, get vaccinated and encourage others to do the same so we can come back together safely."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/more-control-and-context-in-news-feed/","date":"2021-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"More Control and Context in News Feed","text":"Control What You Share Today we’re introducing a new tool to give you more control over what you share to News Feed by managing who can comment on your public posts. Now, you can control your commenting audience for a given public post by choosing from a menu of options ranging from anyone who can see the post to only the people and Pages you tag. The goal of News Feed is to connect you to what matters most to you: the people in your life, interesting content and the world around you. The friends you add, the Pages you like, the groups you join and the things you interact with all shape how your News Feed looks on any given day. By adjusting your commenting audience, you can further control how you want to invite conversation onto your public posts and limit potentially unwanted interactions. And if you’re a public figure, creator or brand, you too can choose to limit your commenting audience on your public posts to help you feel safe and engage in more meaningful conversations with your community. This new tool is the latest example of how we’re helping you control and curate your News Feed to best reflect who you are as your interests and priorities evolve. We also want to continue to help you understand why you see the content you do on News Feed. Control What You See We’re also making it easier to sort and browse News Feed, giving you more control over what you see. We recently launched Favorites, a new tool where you can control and prioritize posts from the friends and Pages you care about most in News Feed. By selecting up to 30 friends and Pages to include in Favorites, their posts will appear higher in ranked News Feed and can also be viewed as a separate filter. People who use Favorites frequently can access it from the Feed Filter Bar, a new menu at the top of News Feed. The Feed Filter Bar offers easier access to Most Recent too, making it simpler to switch between an algorithmically-ranked News Feed and a feed sorted chronologically with the newest posts first. Android app users can access the Feed Filter Bar when they scroll up on News Feed. The same functionality will be available in the iOS app in the coming weeks. Regardless of how often you use them, you can find Most Recent and Favorites in the Shortcuts menu. These are just the latest additions to our existing controls suite designed to help you control what you see in News Feed, including tools such as Snooze (where you can temporarily hide posts from a person, Page, or group) and the ability to turn off political ads. Understand Why You See Suggested Posts in News Feed To help you discover new and relevant content, we suggest posts in your News Feed from places like Pages and Groups that you don’t already follow, but we think you may be interested in. These post suggestions are primarily based on factors such as post engagement, related topics, and location. Because you haven’t chosen to follow these accounts on Facebook, we have clear guidelines about what content we aim to recommend to people. Today, we’re also providing more context around the content we suggest in News Feed by expanding “Why am I seeing this?.” This means that you’ll be able to tap on posts from the friends, Pages, and Groups you follow as well as some of the posts we suggest to you and get more context on why they’re appearing in your News Feed. Several factors influence your suggested posts in News Feed such as: Related engagement: A post may be suggested for you if other people who interacted with the post also previously interacted with the same group, Page or post as you. Related topics: If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we may suggest other posts that are related to that topic. For example, if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball. Location: You may see a suggested post based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. To update what you want to see and how you share to your News Feed, check out your News Feed preferences and privacy settings in the app and adjust them to your liking. We know that helping you better manage your experience on Facebook can support wellbeing, so we will continue to invest in ways to give you more control and context."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/giving-together/","date":"2021-03-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Giving Together","text":""},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/the-healing-power-of-art/","date":"2021-03-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"The Healing Power of Art","text":"Tabitha and her husband Tom believe in the healing power of art.

Starting today, you can set up two-factor authentication and log into Facebook on iOS and Android mobile devices using a security key — available to anyone in the world. What is Two-Factor Authentication? Two-factor authentication is a security feature that helps safeguard your account every time you log into your Facebook account from an unknown device by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have (typically, an SMS code sent to your mobile phone or Authenticator app). It’s much harder for a bad actor to obtain both factors, which keep your password from being your last line of defense against phishing or other malicious attempts to compromise your information. What is a Hardware Security Key? Physical security keys — which can be small enough to fit on your keychain — notify you each time someone tries accessing your Facebook account from a browser or mobile device we don’t recognize. We ask you to confirm it’s you with your key, which attackers don’t have. Who Needs a Hardware Security Key? Since 2017, we’ve encouraged people that are at high risk of being targeted by malicious hackers: politicians, public figures, journalists and human rights defenders. We strongly recommend that everyone considers using physical security keys to increase the security of their accounts, no matter what device they use. Where Can I Get a Security Key? You can purchase security keys directly from companies that make them (Facebook doesn’t manufacture hardware keys). The keys can either work through Bluetooth technology or by plugging it directly into your phone. How Do I Set up a Security Key on My Facebook Account? You can enroll your security key in two-factor authentication within the Security and Login section of your Settings. For more information on how to enroll in two-factor authentication with a security key, please see our Help Center."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/changes-to-keep-facebook-groups-safe/","date":"2021-03-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Integrity & Security","Product News","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Changes to Keep Facebook Groups Safe","text":"Update on October 20, 2021 at 9:00AM PT: Today, we’re announcing new measures to keep Facebook Groups safe. To continue limiting the reach of people who break our rules, we’ll start demoting all Groups content from members who have broken our Community Standards, anywhere on Facebook. These demotions will get more severe as they accrue more violations. This measure will help reduce the ability of members who break our rules from reaching others in their communities, and builds on the existing restrictions placed upon members who violate Community Standards. These current penalties include restricting their ability to post, comment, add new members to a group or create new groups. We also want to make sure that our enforcement is transparent and fair. That’s why we’re announcing Flagged by Facebook. This feature shows admins content that has been flagged for removal before it is shown to the broader community. Admins can then either review and remove the content themselves, or ask for a review by Facebook and provide additional feedback on why they think that piece of content should remain on the platform. Flagged by Facebook involves admins in content review earlier in the process, before members receive a strike and content is removed. Flagged by Facebook is in addition to the existing ability for admins to appeal when something is taken down for violating our Community Standards. This provides more fairness for communities and helps ensure that the right call is being made when it comes to enforcing our policies. Originally published on March 17, 2021 at 8:00AM PT: It’s important to us that people can discover and engage safely with Facebook groups so that they can connect with others around shared interests and life experiences. That’s why we’ve taken action to curb the spread of harmful content, like hate speech and misinformation, and made it harder for certain groups to operate or be discovered, whether they’re Public or Private. When a group repeatedly breaks our rules, we take it down entirely. Today we’re sharing the latest in our ongoing work to keep Groups safe, which includes our thinking on how to keep recommendations safe as well as reducing privileges for those who break our rules. These changes will roll out globally over the coming months. Improving Group Recommendations We know we have a greater responsibility when we are amplifying or recommending content. As we work to make sure that potentially harmful groups aren’t recommended to people, we try to be careful not to penalize high-quality groups on similar topics. The tension we navigate isn’t between our business interests and removing low-quality groups — it’s about taking action on potentially harmful groups while still ensuring that community leaders can grow their groups that follow the rules and bring people value. We try to balance this carefully in our recommendations guidelines, which can be found here. As behaviors evolve on our platform, though, we recognize we need to do more. This is why we recently removed civic and political groups, as well as newly created groups, from recommendations in the US. While people can still invite friends to these groups or search for them, we have now started to expand these restrictions globally. This builds on restrictions we’ve made to recommendations, like removing health groups from these surfaces, as well as groups that repeatedly share misinformation. We are also adding more nuance to our enforcement. When a group starts to violate our rules, we will now start showing them lower in recommendations, which means it’s less likely that people will discover them. This is similar to our approach in News Feed, where we show lower quality posts further down, so fewer people see them. Restricting the Reach of Rule-Breaking Groups and Members We believe that groups and members that violate our rules should have reduced privileges and reach, with restrictions getting more severe as they accrue more violations, until we remove them completely. And when necessary in cases of severe harm, we will outright remove groups and people without these steps in between. Groups We’ll start to let people know when they’re about to join a group that has Community Standards violations, so they can make a more informed decision before joining. We’ll limit invite notifications for these groups, so people are less likely to join. For existing members, we’ll reduce the distribution of that group’s content so that it’s shown lower in News Feed. We think these measures as a whole, along with demoting groups in recommendations, will make it harder to discover and engage with groups that break our rules. We will also start requiring admins and moderators to temporarily approve all posts when that group has a substantial number of members who have violated our policies or were part of other groups that were removed for breaking our rules. This means that content won’t be shown to the wider group until an admin or moderator reviews and approves it. If an admin or moderator repeatedly approves content that breaks our rules, we’ll take the entire group down. Members When someone has repeated violations in groups, we will block them from being able to post or comment for a period of time in any group. They also won’t be able to invite others to any groups, and won’t be able to create new groups. These measures are intended to help slow down the reach of those looking to use our platform for harmful purposes and build on existing restrictions we’ve put in place over the last year. There is always more to do to keep Facebook Groups safe, and we will continue to build and invest to make sure people can rely on these places for connection and support."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/","date":"2021-03-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News","Strengthening Communities","WhatsApp"],"title":"Mark Zuckerberg Announces Facebook’s Plans to Help Get People Vaccinated Against COVID-19","text":"We’ve already connected over 2 billion people to authoritative COVID-19 information, and today as access to COVID-19 vaccines expands, we’re going even further and aiming to help bring 50 million people one step closer to getting vaccinated. To do this, we’re helping people learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and find out when and where they can get one through our apps. Some of the ways we are doing this: A tool to connect people to information about where and when to get a COVID-19 vaccine Expanding our COVID-19 Information Center to Instagram Expanding official WhatsApp chatbots on COVID-19 to get people registered for vaccinations with health authorities and governments Adding labels on posts about COVID-19 vaccines to show additional information from the World Health Organization Making real-time aggregate trends in COVID-19 vaccinations, intent to get vaccinated and reasons for hesitancy available to public officials to inform equitable vaccine rollout By working closely with national and global health authorities and using our scale to reach people quickly, we’re doing our part to help people get credible information, get vaccinated and come back together safely. Helping People Find Where and When They Can Get Vaccinated We’ve partnered with Boston Children’s Hospital to offer a tool on Facebook in the US to help people identify places nearby to get the vaccine. The locations in this tool are provided by VaccineFinder and include hours of operation, contact info and links to make an appointment. You can access this tool in the COVID-19 Information Center and it will be supported in 71 different languages. We plan to expand to other countries as vaccines are available more widely. Connecting People to Resources on Instagram Today, we’re bringing the COVID-19 Information Center to Instagram all around the world. This portal, which we launched in the Facebook app last March, helps people discover the latest information about the virus from local health ministries and the World Health Organization. We’re also releasing new stickers on Instagram Stories, so people can inspire others to get vaccinated when it becomes available to them. Learn more about these efforts on the Instagram blog. Partnering with Health Authorities and Governments on Vaccine Registration To date, 3 billion messages have been sent by governments, nonprofits and international organizations to citizens through official WhatsApp chatbots on COVID-19. We’re now working directly with health authorities and governments to get people registered for vaccinations, including: Last week, the city and province of Buenos Aires, Argentina announced that WhatsApp will be the official channel to send notifications to citizens when it’s their turn to receive the vaccine. In Brazil, a WhatsApp helpline is being used as an information and support channel for residents in Serrana, where health authorities are testing the first mass vaccinations project in the country. In Indonesia, the Ministry of Health started Phase II of its WhatsApp vaccine registration helpline, expanding vaccine registration from frontline workers to senior citizens. Other governments and health authorities, including South Africa and the World Health Organization, are starting to incorporate up-to-date vaccine information into their helplines. Amplifying Credible Health Information and Resources from Experts Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have partnered with ministries of health and health-focused organizations in more than 170 countries by providing free ads, enabling partners to share their own public health guidance on COVID-19 and information about the COVID-19 vaccine. For underserved countries and vulnerable populations such as ethnic minorities and refugees, we also partner with expert local and international NGOs, such as International Medical Corps, who are providing tailored COVID-19 information in local languages. In addition, we continue to work with international bodies like the European Union and African Union in support of their COVID-19 responses. For example, we have helped the European Parliament run a multilingual ad campaign in their 27 Member States, featuring short in-feed videos on Facebook and Instagram. Within a month, the campaign drove strong awareness and consideration, generating more than 100 million views and close to 2 million link clicks across all Member States. We’re also supporting the United Nations’ “Only Together” campaign calling for fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines around the world. In the coming days, we will be launching in-feed informational messages to promote content posted by health organizations who are participating in the UN’s campaign. Promoting Reliable Information About COVID-19 Vaccines In February, in consultation with leading health organizations, including the World Health Organization, we expanded the list of false claims we will remove during the pandemic to include additional debunked claims about the coronavirus and vaccines. Since launching our new policy applying both to old and new content, we have removed an additional 2 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram. The majority of this additional content was previously subject to warning screens, and is now removed from the platform. We’re continuing to expand our efforts to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation by adding labels to Facebook and Instagram posts that discuss the vaccines. These labels contain credible information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines from the World Health Organization. For example, we’re adding a label on posts that discuss the safety of COVID-19 vaccines that notes COVID-19 vaccines go through tests for safety and effectiveness before they’re approved. This label is rolling out globally in English, Spanish, Indonesian, Portuguese, Arabic and French, and we are adding additional languages in the coming weeks. In the coming weeks, we’re rolling out labels on all posts generally about COVID-19 vaccines that point people to the COVID-19 Information Center globally, and plan to add additional targeted labels about COVID-19 vaccine subtopics. We will also add an additional screen when someone goes to share a post on Facebook and Instagram with an informational COVID-19 vaccine label. It will provide more information so people have the context they need to make informed decisions about what to share. Building on our goal to promote authoritative information about COVID-19 vaccines, we have implemented several temporary measures to further limit the spread of potentially harmful COVID-19 and vaccine information during the pandemic. Some of these measures include: Reducing the distribution of content from users that have violated our policies on COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation or that have repeatedly shared content debunked as False or Altered by our third-party fact-checking partners, and of any COVID-19 or vaccine content that fact-checking partners have rated as “Missing Context.” Requiring admins for groups with admins or members who have violated our COVID-19 policies to temporarily approve all posts within their group. Continuing to further elevate information from authoritative sources when people seek information about COVID-19 or vaccines. Making it Easier For Public Officials to Understand Vaccine Behaviors and Trends Around the World Today, we are bringing new data and insights on vaccine attitudes to Facebook Data for Good’s COVID-19 map and dashboard. These visualizations are designed to provide information to inform and monitor vaccine rollouts in over 200 countries and territories. The dashboard is updated in near real time with data collected by our partners at Carnegie Mellon University and University of Maryland as part of the COVID-19 Symptom Survey. For example, globally, the top two reasons why respondents say they do not intend to get vaccinated are fear of side effects and waiting to see if vaccines are safe. Facebook does not host the surveys nor collect survey participant responses, and only has access to public, aggregated survey data provided by the universities. This data can help inform messaging tactics and policy decisions at a regional level. More insights and trends for the US can be found here. Launching CrowdTangle COVID-19 Vaccine Live Displays We’re also making it easy to track how COVID-19 vaccine information is being spread on social media through CrowdTangle’s COVID-19 Live Displays. Publishers, global aid organizations, journalists and others can access real-time, global streams of vaccine-related posts on Facebook, Instagram and Reddit in 34 languages. CrowdTangle also offers Live Displays for 104 countries and all 50 states in the US to help aid organizations and journalists track posts and trends at a regional level as well."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/saving-callum-supporting-life-saving-communities/","date":"2021-03-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Saving Callum: Supporting Life-Saving Communities","text":"When Beth had her son Callum, she turned to Facebook Groups for camaraderie and support as she embarked on her motherhood journey.

Video creators can now earn money from videos as short as one minute long, with a minimally interruptive ad running at 30 seconds. For videos three minutes or longer, an ad can be shown 45 seconds in. Previously only three-minute or longer videos could monetize with in-stream ads, with an ad shown no earlier than 1 minute. This has translated into growing content creator payouts — in-stream ad payouts grew over 55% from 2019 to 2020 — with video partners of all sizes earning meaningful revenue. For example, UFC is generating millions of dollars annually via in-stream ads. And from the end of 2019 through April 2020, Korean chef Seonkyoung Longest’s in-stream revenue increased roughly 50% per month. Looking ahead, we’re exploring in-stream ad formats that increase engagement through rewards or product interaction — intending to help content creator payouts grow. While also providing a good viewing experience for people and a way for advertisers to reach relevant audiences. We’re especially focused on short-form video monetization. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin testing the ability for content creators to monetize their Facebook Stories with ads that look like stickers and receive a portion of the resulting revenue. While the initial test is small, we hope to soon expand to more content creators. And then broaden it to short-form videos on Facebook, eventually providing a way for content creators to monetize this popular content. Increasing Access to Video Monetization Now that we’ve expanded the types of videos that can monetize on Facebook, we’re updating our eligibility criteria so that more content creators can monetize their videos with in-stream ads. To join our in-stream ad for video-on-demand program, Pages must now have: 600,000 total minutes viewed from any combination of video uploads – on-demand, Live and previously Live – in the last 60 days. 5 or more active video uploads or previously Live videos. Videos must be published, not deleted, and compliant with our Content Monetization Policies. Our previous requirements only considered at least three-minute-long on-demand videos. This updated criteria helps video creators that primarily create Live and short-form videos to monetize their recorded videos. Content creators must still publish from a Page (not a profile) with at least 10,000 followers, be 18 years old and located in a supported country, and their Page must pass and remain compliant with our Partner Monetization Policies. Expanding In-stream Ads for Live When the pandemic struck, Dena Blizzard went from performing in comedy clubs across the United States for a living, to live streaming on Facebook from home. With in-stream ads for Live, she’s been able to make up for lost revenue. She saw 65% growth in earnings after joining the program and in-stream ads for Live generates over 50% of her total earnings. Because of stories like this, we’re excited to now make it possible for more content creators to monetize their Live videos with in-stream ads. This program previously was invite only. To qualify for our in-stream ads for Live program, content creators must have 60,000 Live minutes viewed in the last 60 days, in addition to meeting the video-on-demand program requirements. Watch time or uploads from cross-posted videos don’t count towards qualification for both programs. Content creators can check their eligibility and submit their Pages for review for both in-stream ad programs in Creator Studio. We’ll review all applications and gradually expand to ensure we are maintaining strict brand safety requirements. Advertisers can also choose to exclude their ads from being shown in live streams when setting up ad campaigns. Earning Revenue on Live with Stars While ads can be a great way to monetize livestreams, the built-in engagement of Live also lends itself well to earning money with Stars. With a focus on rewarding fan loyalty, we’ve seen Stars enhance the connection between content creators and their community of fans. Over the past 6 months, people sent video and gaming creators an average of 1 billion Stars per month, equal to $10 million USD per month. For example, Vincenzo Girasoli — also known as Idressitalian — uses Live to bring his fans on virtual tours of Italy and monetizes with Stars. From May to September 2020, he averaged 634 people sending him Stars every month and received over one million Stars just in one day. Today we’re announcing that Facebook is investing $7 million over the next few months in consumer education and adoption via free Stars. During certain Star-enabled livestreams, some people will see an offer to claim free Stars that they can send at their discretion to their favorite content creators to boost their visibility and connection with the creator and add to the creators’ earnings. We’ve also introduced several enhancements to Stars. In addition to badges Stars senders already receive, now comments sent with Stars visually stand out and are pinned inside the Live player where other viewers can see them. We’re also introducing virtual gifts that people can send content creators. We’re rapidly expanding Stars to Live-focused video creators in 15+ markets. Those invited can now get access to the feature from their mobile device before they go Live and earn Stars, and then finish their account set-up on their computer in Creator Studio afterward. Content creators can also check eligibility and express interest in getting access here. While Stars has been primarily for Live streams, over the coming weeks we’ll start testing Stars for video-on-demand, exploring features for both short and long-form recorded videos. Expanding Paid Online Events and Fan Subscriptions In August 2020, we introduced our paid online event feature and since then it’s grown tremendously, providing content creators and businesses another valuable way to earn money on Facebook. Pages are hosting a wide range of paid online events — sporting events, cooking classes, Live podcast recordings, virtual tours, make-up tutorials and more — and in doing so are reaching and monetizing new and larger audiences. Comedian Daphnique Springs reimagined her live comedy showcase for a primarily virtual world using paid online events to great success. A Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym in Australia, Subversion Jiu-Jitsu, earned more than $29,000 across three tournaments. And the Teatro San Carlo — Italy’s oldest opera house — brought in over 34,000 purchases in its first paid online event, 25 times the theater’s in-person capacity. Today paid online events are in 20 countries, and we’ll be expanding paid online events to 24 additional countries in the coming weeks: Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Malaysia, Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Portugal, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Our fan subscriptions feature also continues to see strong growth and is providing a reliable source of revenue to content creators worldwide — there are now over 1 million active fan subscriptions to content creators on Facebook. In the upcoming months, we will also expand the product to more countries — we’re currently in 25+ markets and will be expanding to an additional 10 countries; Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. For both paid online events and fan subscriptions, Facebook will continue to not collect any revenue share from either of these products through at least August 2021. A Clear Path to Partnership for Gaming Creators Eligible gaming creators have access to our full suite of monetization products and are earning significant income on the platform. We’re introducing a new set of minimum eligibility criteria for aspiring Gaming creators seeking to apply for a partnership with Facebook Gaming. Creators in Australia, Great Britain, Mexico, the Philippines and the United States can see the new partner eligibility criteria and the progress they’ve made toward fulfilling them in their streamer dashboard, with additional regions coming online soon. Full Suite of Creator-Centric Products and Tools Content creators can earn money from ads via our in-stream ads program, from the support of their fans via fan subscriptions and paid online events, through our Stars feature and with paid partnerships via branded content and brand collabs manager. This means that all types of content creators can choose the mix of products that best matches the community they’ve built and the content they share. To access any of our monetization programs, content creators must abide by our partner monetization policies and content monetization policies. These sets of policies include our Community Standards and an additional level of standards above and beyond our Community Standards that govern both Pages and Page content to ensure that monetized content creates value for people. We look forward to continuing to enhance all our monetization products so that content creators can thrive on Facebook.

In 2020, women created twice as many fundraisers on Facebook as men and made twice as many donations, with 64% of total funds raised coming from women. And women have led on growing communities and rallying resources, creating 2.7X more COVID-19-related groups than men with 4X more members. To support these efforts we’re launching new features across our apps to help people celebrate and empower the women in their lives, and we’re elevating the voices of diverse women leaders creating change in their fields and communities. We’re also sharing new ways for people to support women-led small businesses. Celebrate with New Product Features Creators and others can now go live on Instagram with up to three other people with the launch of Live Rooms. During Women’s History Month, you can tune in to Live discussions with influential women and creators on how women can help each other overcome obstacles and succeed. You can also share new stickers on Instagram illustrated by diverse women around the world to highlight intersectionality. And on Messenger, you’ll be able to send new custom sticker art created in partnership with leading women’s media and entertainment company Refinery29 to celebrate the women in your life and encourage conversation around those who’ve paved the way in their communities. The artwork was designed by acclaimed illustrator Jade Purple Brown and will be available in March and beyond. Also, on Messenger Kids, girls can share stickers from a new collection designed to empower them to express themselves, connect with their passions and write their own story. On Facebook we’re encouraging people to #shoutout a leading lady in their life. Use #shoutout and #IWD2021 to find and share inspiring stories. We’re also launching a new category in Community Help on Facebook to enable people and nonprofits to organize drives and collect essential items like clothing, undergarments, shoes and feminine hygiene products for underserved women and girls. Support Women-Owned Businesses and Economic Equality You can support women-owned businesses by visiting the women-owned shopping collections on Facebook and Instagram Shop tabs and Instagram’s official shopping account @shop. And across North America, Latin America and Asia, women business leaders can participate in #SheMeansBusiness trainings and workshops hosted by Facebook to commemorate the five-year anniversary of #SheMeansBusiness. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we’re partnering with women leaders and influencers in business, media and entertainment to release e-books on International Women’s Day that feature their learnings and advice and encourage women to stand up for gender equality. Get Inspired Georgia Clark, Founder of Generation Women Glynn Pogue, writer and teacher, Generation Women speaker Janice Maffei, playwright and entrepreneur, Generation Women speaker Verta Maloney, community builder and storyteller, Generation Women speaker Starting March 8 we’ll kick off our Women x Women campaign to spotlight inspiring stories of women, celebrate their accomplishments and showcase how they’ve found strength and community across our apps this year. We’ll feature organizations like Generation Women, a collective of diverse women at various ages who support each other by sharing life experiences, and encourage people to celebrate the women in their life through posts and stories on Facebook and Instagram. And throughout the month, you can visit our Facebook and Instagram accounts to hear from inspiring women creators, advocates, entrepreneurs and small business owners."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/celebrating-black-movements-black-girl-magic/","date":"2021-02-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Celebrating Black Movements: Black Girl Magic","text":"Black Girl Magic was born as a way to celebrate the beauty, power and resilience of Black women. Now it’s transformed into a mantra for every generation. This Black History Month, we’re exploring stories that hero the beauty of blackness and the bravery of natural leaders. We are inspired by the Black women who use their voices on our platforms to redefine the future. Here are the stories of two of them. Supporting Black Artists As the youngest photographer to ever shoot the cover of British Vogue, 21-year-old Kennedi Carter has already made Black History — and continues to shape it every day. Kennedi defines Black Girl Magic through her portraits as she aims to reinvent notions of creativity and confidence in the realm of Blackness. The work she shares on Instagram gives a slice-of-life insight into her family and her home in Durham, North Carolina. She is continually finding new ways to shed light on the often overlooked beauties of the Black experience. This self-portrait was captured by Kennedi last year as her father cut her hair, while barbershops were closed during quarantine. For Kennedi, it’s a reminder to be more gentle with herself, emotionally and in her portraits. “I draw inspiration from love, whether it be familiar or romantic, sexuality and sensuality, family and friendship — and all of those things within this vein of Blackness in the South.” Supporting Black Youth As the CEO and founder of Healthy Roots Dolls, Yelitsa Jean-Charles is writing Black History by bringing curl power to the toy aisle and inspiring the next generation to embrace their Black Girl Magic every day. “In undergrad, I did research about the impact that toys have on children’s self-esteem,” says Yelitsa. She saw a gap in the market, and that’s when the idea for Healthy Roots Dolls was born. “I wanted to create a line of dolls that focused on teaching girls to love their natural hair with different skin tones, facial features and hair textures.” The first prototype, Zoey, was about more than just painting a doll brown. Zoey teaches young children how to love their curls through the process of play. Now on her Facebook page, Yelitsa shares the joy that Healthy Roots Dolls has sparked across her community daily. We honor these movements and continue to highlight Black women who are leading the way to a just future.

These labels will link to the Climate Science Information Center where people can find factual information from leading climate organizations and resources to take action against climate change. Originally published on February 18, 2021 at 3:00AM PT: Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to combating climate change. We’re expanding and improving our Climate Science Information Center, and introducing new ways for people to discover it. The Climate Science Information Center connects people on Facebook with science-based news, approachable information and actionable resources from the world’s leading climate change organizations. The center includes detailed deep dives that go beyond the basic facts, as well as ways to get involved. It also has information relevant to where you live. The center is already available in France, Germany, the UK and US, from today our center will also be available in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Spain, South Africa and Taiwan. Along with expanding the center, we’re improving it. We added a section that features facts that debunk common climate myths — including too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere harms the earth’s plant life and polar bear populations are declining because of global warming. To debunk the myths with current and specific facts, we’ve brought in climate communication experts from the George Mason University, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the University of Cambridge. “Developing rebuttals based on the best-practices from communication research is an important step towards countering online misinformation, and I look forward to exploring more solutions.” — Dr. John Cook, George Mason University “Misinformation about climate change long predates the internet, but has been greatly amplified in our new digital world. This new mythbusting section of the Facebook Climate Science Information Center can help raise public climate change awareness and understanding worldwide.” — Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, Yale Program on Climate Change Communication “The spread of damaging falsehoods endangers the level of international cooperation required to prevent catastrophic global warming. Facebook is in a unique position to counter the circulation of online misinformation, and the new climate ‘mythbusting’ section is an important step toward debunking dangerous falsehoods.” — Dr. Sander van der Linden, University of Cambridge We already direct people to the Climate Science Information Center when they search for climate-related terms, and will keep doing that where the center is available. In countries where it isn’t, we will soon direct people to the UN Environment Programme, a leading global environmental authority. We’re also starting to add informational labels to some posts on climate in the UK that direct people to the center, and we plan to expand to more countries soon. As Nancy Groves, of the UN Environmental Programme, puts it: “A healthy planet depends on everyone, everywhere and that starts with people having access to accurate and timely information. We look forward to continuing to work with Facebook on this new effort to dispel myths and to provide access to the latest science on the climate emergency.”"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/","date":"2021-02-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Public Policy"],"title":"Changes to Sharing and Viewing News on Facebook in Australia","text":"Update on February 22, 2021 at 8:20PM PT: We’re pleased that we’ve been able to reach an agreement with the Australian government and appreciate the constructive discussions we’ve had with Treasurer Frydenberg and Minister Fletcher over the past week. We have consistently supported a framework that would encourage innovation and collaboration between online platforms and publishers. After further discussions, we are satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them. As a result of these changes, we can now work to further our investment in public interest journalism and restore news on Facebook for Australians in the coming days. Read an additional statement from Campbell Brown, VP, Global News Partnerships on our Facebook Journalism Project site. Originally published on February 17, 2021 at 10:31AM PT: In response to Australia’s proposed new Media Bargaining law, Facebook will restrict publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content. The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content. It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter. This discussion has focused on US technology companies and how they benefit from news content on their services. We understand many will ask why the platforms may respond differently. The answer is because our platforms have fundamentally different relationships with news. Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue. In fact, and as we have made clear to the Australian government for many months, the value exchange between Facebook and publishers runs in favor of the publishers — which is the reverse of what the legislation would require the arbitrator to assume. Last year Facebook generated approximately 5.1 billion free referrals to Australian publishers worth an estimated AU$407 million. For Facebook, the business gain from news is minimal. News makes up less than 4% of the content people see in their News Feed. Journalism is important to a democratic society, which is why we build dedicated, free tools to support news organisations around the world in innovating their content for online audiences. Over the last three years we’ve worked with the Australian Government to find a solution that recognizes the realities of how our services work. We’ve long worked toward rules that would encourage innovation and collaboration between digital platforms and news organisations. Unfortunately this legislation does not do that. Instead it seeks to penalise Facebook for content it didn’t take or ask for. We were prepared to launch Facebook News in Australia and significantly increase our investments with local publishers, however, we were only prepared to do this with the right rules in place. This legislation sets a precedent where the government decides who enters into these news content agreements, and ultimately, how much the party that already receives value from the free service gets paid. We will now prioritise investments to other countries, as part of our plans to invest in new licensing news programs and experiences. Others have also raised concern. Independent experts and analysts around the world have consistently outlined problems with the proposed legislation. While the government has made some changes, the proposed law fundamentally fails to understand how our services work. Unfortunately, this means people and news organisations in Australia are now restricted from posting news links and sharing or viewing Australian and international news content on Facebook. Globally, posting and sharing news links from Australian publishers is also restricted. To do this, we are using a combination of technologies to restrict news content and we will have processes to review any content that was inadvertently removed. For Australian publishers this means: They are restricted from sharing or posting any content on Facebook Pages Admins will still be able to access other features from their Facebook Page, including Page insights and Creator Studio We will continue to provide access to all other standard Facebook services, including data tools and CrowdTangle For international publishers this means: They can continue to publish news content on Facebook, but links and posts can’t be viewed or shared by Australian audiences For our Australian community this means: They cannot view or share Australian or international news content on Facebook or content from Australian and international news Pages For our international community this means: They cannot view or share Australian news content on Facebook or content from Australian news Pages The changes affecting news content will not otherwise change Facebook’s products and services in Australia. We want to assure the millions of Australians using Facebook to connect with friends and family, grow their businesses and join Groups to help support their local communities, that these services will not change. We recognise it’s important to connect people to authoritative information and we will continue to promote dedicated information hubs like the COVID-19 Information Centre, that connects Australians with relevant health information. Our commitment to remove harmful misinformation and provide access to credible and timely information will not change. We remain committed to our third-party fact-checking program with Agence France-Presse and Australian Associated Press and will continue to invest to support their important work. Our global commitment to invest in quality news also has not changed. We recognise that news provides a vitally important role in society and democracy, which is why we recently expanded Facebook News to hundreds of publications in the UK. We hope that in the future the Australian government will recognise the value we already provide and work with us to strengthen, rather than limit, our partnerships with publishers."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/celebrating-black-movements-black-health-matters/","date":"2021-02-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Celebrating Black Movements: Black Health Matters","text":"The movements created by the Black community are constantly making waves around the world. From Black creators, organizers to athletes and entrepreneurs — black community leaders have harnessed their purpose and passion to redefine the future. Together, they are building a rich and diverse legacy that transcends time. We are inspired by their words and celebrate their stories, shared across our platforms daily, and want to highlight two individuals who are writing Black History. Supporting Black Families Na’imah Delpeche is writing Black History as a doula every day. Black women disproportionately face complications during pregnancy and childbirth and doulas are invaluable leaders in the Black Health Matters movement. For over 16 years, Na’imah’s role as a doula has been critical in providing mothers with physical and emotional comfort, support and guidance in birthing. While so much of her work is advocating for the mother and the baby, Na’imah also creates a transformational environment for men to step into fatherhood. She describes the mother as the doer, and the father as the receiver — and there is power in that ritual. In society, Nai’imah explains, men feel most valued when they are active participants. But here they are the witnesser, the observer, the recipient — holding space for new life. “When you talk about boys being vulnerable and girls feeling empowered, it starts then, like that very moment. You build different parents. You build different men. You build different babies.” Outside of birthing, Na’imah is continually educating on the importance of Black maternal health on her Instagram. Supporting Black Mental Health Ashley McGirt is writing Black History by progressing free mental health for the Black community. Ashley started the Washington Therapy Fund Foundation to help eliminate barriers to Black healing. Through the Black Health Matters movement, Ashley is carving out space for Black voices to be heard daily. Through her Facebook Page, she shares tips and services that empower people of color through mental health education and radical self-love. “We all need to heal, and it’s a constant, continuous journey. My clients always ask me, ‘So Ashley, when will I be fixed?’ Well for one, you’re not even broken. It’s how do you deal with the pieces that you’ve been given? How do you navigate those pieces because you’re already whole? And how do you continue to go about in this world that was not necessarily designed for yourself?” These movements are celebrations of abundance, healing and growth. As we follow these stories we are inspired by the community leaders who use their voice on our platforms to honor traditions and cultivate new ones.

We have now implemented these changes globally. Update on May 24, 2022 at 8:00AM PT: As part of these tests to address feedback from people wanting to see less political content in their Feed, we put less weight on comments and shares when ranking political content. When surveyed, people who experienced these changes said they saw less of the content they did not find valuable. Based on those results, we’re further expanding tests globally. We’ll continue to share updates as we assess and refine these tests. Update on December 9, 2021 at 9:00AM PT: We are expanding our political ranking tests to Facebook Watch content. We will share more about the impact of these tests as they progress. Update on October 13, 2021 at 12:00PM PT: We are expanding the political content ranking tests to more countries around the world. As we get more insights from these tests, we’ll share updates on what we’re learning and will continue to make changes accordingly. Update on August 31, 2021 at 8:00AM PT: We’ve seen positive results from our tests to address the feedback we’ve received from people about wanting to see less political content in their News Feed. As a result, we plan to expand these tests to Costa Rica, Sweden, Spain and Ireland. We’ve also learned that some engagement signals can better indicate what posts people find more valuable than others. Based on that feedback, we’re gradually expanding some tests to put less emphasis on signals such as how likely someone is to comment on or share political content. At the same time, we’re putting more emphasis on new signals such as how likely people are to provide us with negative feedback on posts about political topics and current events when we rank those types of posts in their News Feed. We’ve learned that these changes will affect public affairs content more broadly and that publishers may see an impact on their traffic. Knowing this, we are planning a gradual and methodical rollout for these tests, but remain encouraged, and expect to announce further expansions in the coming months. Update on February 17, 2021 at 10:55AM PT: The initial tests to reduce the distribution of political content in News Feed are now live in the US for a small percentage of users. Originally published on February 10, 2021 at 5:00AM PT: As Mark Zuckerberg mentioned on our recent earnings call, one common piece of feedback we hear is that people don’t want political content to take over their News Feed. Over the next few months, we’ll work to better understand peoples’ varied preferences for political content and test a number of approaches based on those insights. As a first step, we’ll temporarily reduce the distribution of political content in News Feed for a small percentage of people in Canada, Brazil and Indonesia this week, and the US in the coming weeks. During these initial tests we’ll explore a variety of ways to rank political content in people’s feeds using different signals, and then decide on the approaches we’ll use going forward. COVID-19 information from authoritative health organizations like the CDC and WHO, as well as national and regional health agencies and services from affected countries, will be exempt from these tests. Content from official government agencies and services will also be exempt. To determine how effective these new approaches are, we’ll survey people about their experience during these tests. It’s important to note that we’re not removing political content from Facebook altogether. Our goal is to preserve the ability for people to find and interact with political content on Facebook, while respecting each person’s appetite for it at the top of their News Feed. Based on our analyses in the US, political content only makes up about 3% (this number was updated on November 4, 2022) of what people see on Facebook. And although each person’s News Feed is different, we know even a small percentage of political content can impact someone’s overall experience. We already offer controls to help you manage what you see in News Feed, such as tools like Favorites which lets you select people and pages you want to prioritize in your News Feed; Snooze to temporarily hide posts from a person, page or group; and the ability to turn off political ads. But we’re always trying to make News Feed better, and this means finding a new balance of the content people want to see. As we embark on this work, we’ll share what we learn and the approaches that show the most promise."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reaching-billions-of-people-with-covid-19-vaccine-information/","date":"2021-02-07T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Product News","Public Policy","WhatsApp"],"title":"Reaching Billions of People With COVID-19 Vaccine Information","text":"We’re running the largest worldwide campaign to promote authoritative information about COVID-19 vaccines by: Helping people find where and when they can get vaccinated — similar to how we helped people find information about how to vote during elections Giving $120 million in ad credits to help health ministries, NGOs and UN agencies reach billions of people around the world with COVID-19 vaccine and preventive health information Expanding our efforts to remove false claims on Facebook and Instagram about COVID-19 and vaccines Providing data to inform effective vaccine delivery and educational efforts to build trust in COVID-19 vaccines A year ago, COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency and since then, we’ve helped health authorities reach billions of people with accurate information and supported health and economic relief efforts. We’ve connected over 2 billion people from 189 countries to reliable information about the coronavirus through our COVID-19 Information Center and informational messages, and we’ve removed more than 12 million pieces of content on Facebook and Instagram containing misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm. We’ve partnered with governments in more than 120 countries, as well as multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, to deliver timely information about COVID-19, including through helplines on WhatsApp. We’ve provided researchers and public health officials with real-time data and tools to help inform disease forecasting and understand the effectiveness of prevention measures. Through our Data for Good program, we’ve partnered with over 450 organizations in nearly 70 countries, the vast majority of which are leveraging our tools to support the COVID-19 response in their communities. And our publicly available datasets were downloaded over a million times in the last year by nonprofits, public health officials and researchers. But there’s still a long road ahead, and in 2021 we’re focused on supporting health leaders and public officials in their work to vaccinate billions of people against COVID-19. Building trust and confidence in these vaccines is critical, so we’re launching the largest worldwide campaign to help public health organizations share accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines and encourage people to get vaccinated as vaccines become available to them. Helping People Find Where and When They Can Get Vaccinated As public officials roll out information on COVID-19 vaccine availability, we’ll help people find where and when they can get vaccinated — similar to how we helped people find information about where and when to vote during elections. Starting this week in the US, we’ll feature links in the COVID-19 Information Center to local ministry of health websites to help people understand whether they’re eligible to get vaccinated and how to do so. And in the coming weeks, as more information becomes available, we’ll continue to expand this feature to more countries and improve it to make it easier for people to see where and when they can get vaccinated in just a few taps. Sharing Credible Information About COVID-19 Vaccines We’re working with health organizations and community leaders to run campaigns on our platform promoting accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines and encouraging people to get vaccinated. We’re giving $120 million in ad credits to help health ministries, NGOs and UN agencies reach billions of people around the world with COVID-19 vaccine and preventive health information. And we’re providing training and marketing support to help governments and health organizations move quickly and reach the right people with the latest vaccine information. We’ll soon bring the COVID-19 Information Center to Instagram so people can access the latest information about COVID-19 vaccines across our apps. We’re also helping health authorities and governments share timely vaccine information over WhatsApp and provide answers to people’s questions. We partnered with the government in Indonesia to create a helpline on WhatsApp that shares information on vaccine availability first with medical workers, and eventually with the general public. In just 5 days, 500,000 medical workers — out of 1.3 million in the country — accessed the service. Other governments and health authorities, including the South Africa government and the WHO, are starting to create similar helplines to provide the latest vaccine information. We’re also working to amplify content that directly serves communities where vaccine intent and access may be lower. In the US, we’re partnering with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to reach Native American communities, Black communities and Latinx communities, among others, with science and evidence-based content that addresses the questions and concerns these communities have. We’re also working with AARP to reach Americans over 50 with educational content about COVID-19 vaccines, including Spanish-language content designed to reach Latinx and Hispanic communities. This builds on the work we’ve done with health organizations over the past year to increase adoption of COVID-19 preventive behaviors, such as wearing a mask. We put reminders at the top of Facebook and Instagram to wear a mask. And we reached over 26 million people with our public figure campaign encouraging people to #WearAMask, resulting in a 7-point increase in people reporting that wearing a mask in public is very or extremely important. We’ll use insights and best practices from this work to inform vaccine information campaigns and support health authorities in building confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Combating Vaccine Misinformation In addition to sharing reliable information, we are expanding our efforts to remove false claims on Facebook and Instagram about COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general during the pandemic. Today, following consultations with leading health organizations, including the WHO, we’re expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include additional debunked claims about COVID-19 and vaccines. Learn more about how we’re combating COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation. Providing Data to Inform Effective Vaccine Delivery Last year, we began collaborating with Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Research Group and the University of Maryland on COVID-19 surveys about symptoms people are experiencing, mask wearing behaviors and access to care. These surveys are conducted by our academic partners and Facebook does not receive individual survey responses. With over 50 million responses to date, the survey program is one of the largest ever conducted and has helped health researchers better monitor and forecast the spread of COVID-19. It’s also the only source of global data on mask wearing, which has helped public health officials around the world in their COVID-19 response efforts. The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation used insights from the surveys to inform several mask mandates in countries such as Poland, which achieved a significant increase in mask wearing. The survey data shows that people’s willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine varies widely across the world, with over 90% of people in Denmark saying they would take a COVID-19 vaccine compared to 71% in Argentina and 62% in the Philippines. And in the US, less than 60% of Black or African American people reported they would be likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine. So to help guide the effective delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, the survey data will provide a better understanding of trends in vaccine intent across sociodemographics, race, geography and more. The scale of the survey will also allow for faster updates on changes in trends, such as whether vaccine intent is going up or down in California in a given week and better insights on how vaccine intent varies at a local level. We’ll share these new insights including vaccine attitudes at a county level in the US as well as globally. Data has proved critical in informing the fight against COVID-19. In 2020, we launched new datasets, maps and tools to support researchers, nonprofits and governments in their COVID-19 response, and in 2021, we’ll continue to provide helpful data and insights to understand vaccine attitudes, build trust in vaccines through reliable information and support vaccination efforts.

We are also sharing an update on the commitments we made in June, including $200 million to support Black-owned businesses and organizations as part of a broader $1.1 billion investment in Black and diverse suppliers and communities in the US. Black history is not just a month. It is written every day. Black creators and community leaders are making their mark on the world and using our apps to share their stories — from pushing culture forward on Instagram to turning Facebook movements into lasting legacies. In turn, Facebook has been using its platforms to elevate Black voices and businesses. This month, in particular, we’re spotlighting content from the Black community and the diversity of experiences, interests and definitions of “Blackness.” We’re starting by launching “Written By,” a docuseries celebrating the powerful movements happening across our apps. Throughout the month, we’ll feature stories by award-winning director and cinematographer Bradford Young on our Facebook company page to promote conversations about how Black history continues to be written in real-time. We will also officially kick off We The Culture, a creative community fueled and curated by Black creators dedicated to championing Black culture. Started by a passionate team of Black employees at Facebook, We The Culture’s goal is to partner with Black creators to spark community and empower them to build compelling and successful networks across our apps. Over the years, we’ve invested $25 million in support of Black content partnerships, and we’ll continue to elevate Black public figures and creators in film, television, fitness, sports, broadcasting, publishing and music. Later this month, Facebook Watch is dropping a new original four-episode miniseries showcasing Black excellence in music. Each episode of “Forward: The Future of Black Music” will feature a music icon shining the light on a newcomer they believe to be the future. Influenced by the classic TV series “Iconoclasts,” viewers will be a fly-on-the-wall for a musical experience with a legend and their successor. The series will also be viewable on Messenger’s Watch Together. On the Facebook app, the Lift Black Voices hub will feature an expansive view of the Black diaspora — honoring and celebrating the past, present and future of Black communities. Content will be refreshed throughout the month and will include themes such as Black history throughout the diaspora, Black love and Black creatives and the new vanguard. Facebook app will also launch “Black Makes A Way” to spotlight the diversity within the Black experience. We’ve partnered with Theresa Tha Songbird to create a visual cypher of her poem “You So Black” and will showcase members of Facebook Groups who are lending their voice to further equity, inclusivity and excellence throughout the community. On Instagram, we’ll be celebrating Black innovation with #ShareBlackStories, a multi-channel, call-to-action designed to support and inspire our Black community in the US. We’re publishing new creative tools in the Instagram Camera and stories visible on @instagram, @creators, @design, @shop and @instagramforbusiness throughout February and hosting workshops and other virtual community-focused moments for Black creators. To encourage diversity on the Facebook Gaming platform, we have allocated $10 million over two years to fund the Black Gaming Creator Program, a path for Black gaming creators to apply for partnership status and exclusive benefits including mentorship and training on the platform. This month and beyond, we’re using our platforms to elevate Black businesses. Black-owned businesses have been facing enormous challenges during the pandemic. In June, Facebook committed an additional $200 million to Black-owned businesses, creators and nonprofits. Since then, we have awarded grants to over 10,000 Black-owned businesses in the US and launched additional resources and programming. Facebook Elevate is our community and learning platform to accelerate the growth of Black and Latinx and Hispanic businesses. For Black History Month, Elevate is offering a slate of inspirational and educational programming, themed “Generation Black.” This is part of a three-year effort to reach 1 million Black and 1 million Latinx and Hispanic members of the community with training in digital skills and disburse 100,000 scholarships to Black learners. Following our #BuyBlack Friday campaign during the holiday season, to make it easy for millions of consumers to find and buy directly from Black-owned small businesses, we are launching #BuyBlack shopping collections on Facebook and Instagram Shop tabs and on @shop. Facebook continues to support initiatives that promote greater economic and health equity, diversity and inclusion. Last year, we donated $10 million to 36 US nonprofit organizations — nominated by Facebook employees and selected with guidance from expert advisors — that are working to address the systemic barriers to race equity in this country. We supported organizations including All Star Code, Management Leadership for Tomorrow and the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. We also provided grants and developed partnerships with community foundations across the US that will distribute $20 million to at least 400 local nonprofits serving Black communities, with a preference for Black-led organizations. We also partnered with the Association for Black Foundation Executives to provide racial equity training for community foundation staff, leadership and trustees. Through Facebook’s Supplier Diversity program, we have spent more than $1.1 billion with diverse-owned US businesses over the past four years. Last year we launched the Facebook Receivables Financing Program to further support US-based diverse suppliers during the pandemic. The program provides immediate cash for work that suppliers have done and pay they’re owed by other, non-Facebook, companies. We have also taken a closer look at how we make decisions and support a diverse and inclusive culture at our company. We established a Diversity Advisory Council, a group of 18 employees from diverse backgrounds across the globe who will meet quarterly to consult on our content policies, products and people program. In January, we announced that Roy Austin, a nationally renowned civil rights attorney and advocate, was joining our company to establish a new civil rights organization, an incredibly important role for Facebook and for the tech industry. As the world navigates a historic health pandemic, a growing economic crisis and a racial justice awakening, it’s more important than ever that we support Black businesses, employees and communities. We don’t see this work as tied to any one month and any given year. Counteracting historical and present-day inequities is something Facebook has and will continue to be committed to for years."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/facebook-news-will-help-sustain-quality-journalism/","date":"2021-01-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook"],"title":"Facebook News Will Help Sustain Quality Journalism","text":"This piece originally appeared in The Telegraph. The internet has disrupted long-established business models in all sorts of industries, but there are few where its impact has raised more profound questions for society than the news industry. High quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function — informing and empowering citizens and holding the powerful to account. But when advertisements started moving from print newspapers to websites, the economics of news changed. This has been a double-edged sword – social media and other internet services give news outlets ways to reach new audiences, but they also create a whole new environment where people can get news easily from a range of sources. Breaking the link between publishers and readers has made it harder for the news industry to adapt financially. Print circulations have been in steady decline. New business models have sprung up – from those who sell subscriptions to paywalled apps and websites, to those who make their journalism available for free, paid for by advertising and donations from loyal readers. For many people, Facebook is one of the places they find news. While the amount of news on Facebook is small as a proportion of the content seen overall — less than 4% of what people see in their feed are posts with links to news articles — it undoubtedly plays a significant role in the distribution of journalism. That’s why Facebook has been working with news organisations around the world for many years to figure out how it can best support the industry for the long term. Facebook News, which launches in the UK on Tuesday, is a result of those conversations. This is a big shift in Facebook’s approach to journalism — a dedicated place within the Facebook app featuring news from national outlets including The Telegraph Media Group, The Guardian, Financial Times, Daily Mail Group, Sky News, Channel 4 News, The Economist, The Mirror, The Independent, hundreds of local news sites, and lifestyle ones including GQ, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Vogue and many more. With Facebook News you will see the top headlines and stories of the day next to news personalised to your interests. During major news cycles, Facebook News will provide timely news digests, highlighting original and authoritative reporting. It will also give you more control over the stories you see in the app, and the ability to explore news on a wide range of topics. News articles shared by your family, friends or pages you follow will continue to appear in your main feed as normal. Of course, this speaks to a wider debate about how exactly we should define social media companies such as Facebook. It is neither a publisher — at least not in the traditional sense – nor is it a utility. There is no editor dictating the front page headline millions will read. Instead there are billions of “front pages,” each personalised to our individual tastes and preferences, and consisting of content created and shared by users themselves. But Facebook is not passive either. It can and does remove harmful content from its platform, and people too — as it did recently when suspending President Trump — and where content is considered borderline or misinformation, it reduces its distribution. The reality is Facebook and other social platforms are something entirely new — and should be regulated as such. We believe that supporting journalism through new products like Facebook News is more likely to succeed in the long run than other potential forms of support. If publishers were paid every time they posted an article, or every time someone clicked on one, it would incentivise clickbait, sensationalism and volume over high quality journalism. It would also favour bigger publishers with the resources to pump out masses of stories. Likewise, requiring technology companies to subsidise media companies would risk skewing financial support to large corporations at the expense of the small local news providers who need help the most. We expect to roll out Facebook News in Germany and France this year, and we hope to collaborate with publishers and experiment with various new product models in other countries where the regulatory landscape allows. It won’t solve every issue news publishers face or resolve all the tensions social media has created for the news industry. But it should create more value for publishers, and in doing so, help to sustain great national and local journalism."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/how-does-news-feed-predict-what-you-want-to-see/","date":"2021-01-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook"],"title":"How Does News Feed Predict What You Want to See?","text":"When it comes to the News Feed algorithm, there are many theories and myths. Most people understand that there’s an algorithm at work, and many know some of the factors that inform that algorithm (whether you like a post or engage with it, etc.). But there’s still quite a lot that’s misunderstood. We publicly share many of the details and features of News Feed. But under the hood, the machine learning (ML) ranking system that powers News Feed is incredibly complex, with many layers. We are sharing new details about how our ranking system works and the challenges of building a system to personalize the content for more than 2 billion people and show each of them content that is relevant and meaningful for them, every time they come to Facebook. What’s So Hard About This? First, the volume is enormous. More than 2 billion people around the world use Facebook. For each of those people, there are more than a thousand “candidate” posts (or posts that could potentially appear in that person’s feed). We are now talking about trillions of posts across all the people on Facebook. Now consider that for each person on Facebook, there are thousands of signals that we need to evaluate to determine what that person might find most relevant. So we have trillions of posts and thousands of signals — and we need to predict what each of those people wants to see in their feed instantly. When you open up Facebook, that process happens in the background in just the second or so it takes to load your News Feed. And once we’ve got all this working, things change, and we need to factor in new issues that arise, such as clickbait and the spread of misinformation. When this happens, we need to find new solutions. In reality, the ranking system is not just one single algorithm; it’s multiple layers of ML models and rankings that we apply in order to predict the content that’s most relevant and meaningful for each user. As we move through each stage, the ranking system narrows down those thousands of candidate posts to the few hundred that appear in someone’s News Feed at any given time. How Does it Work? Put simply, the system determines which posts show up in your News Feed, and in what order, by predicting what you’re most likely to be interested in or engage with. These predictions are based on a variety of factors, including what and whom you’ve followed, liked, or engaged with recently. To understand how this works in practice, let’s start with what happens for one person logging in to Facebook: We’ll call him Juan. Since Juan’s login yesterday, his friend Wei posted a photo of his cocker spaniel. Another friend, Saanvi, posted a video from her morning run. His favorite Page published an interesting article about the best way to view the Milky Way at night, while his favorite cooking Group posted four new sourdough recipes. All this content is likely to be relevant or interesting to Juan because he has chosen to follow the people or Pages sharing it. To decide which of these things should appear higher in Juan’s News Feed, we need to predict what matters most to him and which content carries the highest value for him. In mathematical terms, we need to define an objective function for Juan and perform a single-objective optimization. We can use the characteristics of a post, such as who is tagged in a photo and when it was posted, to predict whether Juan might like it. For example, if Juan tends to interact with Saanvi’s posts (e.g., sharing or commenting) often and her running video is very recent, there is a high probability that Juan will like her post. If Juan has engaged with more video content than photos in the past, the like prediction for Wei’s photo of his cocker spaniel might be fairly low. In this case, our ranking algorithm would rank Saanvi’s running video higher than Wei’s dog photo because it predicts a higher probability that Juan would like it. But liking is not the only way people express their preferences on Facebook. Every day, people share articles they find interesting, watch videos from people or celebrities they follow, or leave thoughtful comments on their friends’ posts. Mathematically, things get more complex when we need to optimize for multiple objectives that all add up to our primary objective: creating the most long-term value for people by showing them content that is meaningful and relevant to them. Multiple ML models produce multiple predictions for Juan: the probability that he’ll engage with Wei’s photo, Saanvi’s video, the Milky Way article, or the sourdough recipes. Each model tries to rank these pieces of content for Juan. Sometimes they disagree — there might be a higher probability that Juan would like Saanvi’s running video than the Milky Way article, but he might be more likely to comment on the article than on the video. So we need a way to combine these varying predictions into one score that’s optimized for our primary objective of long-term value. How can we measure whether something creates long-term value for a person? We ask them. For example, we survey people to ask how meaningful they found an interaction with their friends or whether a post was worth their time so that our system reflects what people say they enjoy and find meaningful. Then we can take each prediction into account for Juan based on the actions that people tell us (via surveys) are more meaningful and worth their time. Peeling Back the Layers To rank more than a thousand posts per user, per day, for more than 2 billion people — in real time — we need to make the process efficient. We manage this in various steps, strategically arranged to make it fast and to limit the amount of computing resources required. First, the system collects all the candidate posts we can possibly rank for Juan (the cocker spaniel photo, the running video, etc.). This eligible inventory includes any post shared with Juan by a friend, Group, or Page he’s connected to that was made since his last login and has not been deleted. But how should we handle posts created before Juan’s last login that he hasn’t seen yet? To make sure unseen posts are reconsidered, we apply an unread bumping logic: Fresh posts that were ranked for Juan (but not seen by him) in his previous sessions are added to the eligible inventory for this session. We also apply an action-bumping logic so that any posts Juan has already seen that have since triggered an interesting conversation among his friends are added to the eligible inventory as well. Next, the system needs to score each post for a variety of factors, such as the type of post, similarity to other items, and how much the post matches what Juan tends to interact with. To calculate this for more than 1,000 posts, for each of the billions of users — all in real time — we run these models for all candidate stories in parallel on multiple machines, called predictors. Before we combine all these predictions into a single score, we need to apply some additional rules. We wait until after we have these first predictions so that we can narrow the pool of posts to be ranked — and we apply them over multiple passes to save computational power. First, certain integrity processes are applied to every post. These are designed to determine which integrity detection measures, if any, need to be applied to the stories selected for ranking. In the next pass, a lightweight model narrows the pool of candidates to approximately 500 of the most relevant posts for Juan. Ranking fewer stories allows us to use more powerful neural network models for the next passes. Next is the main scoring pass, where most of the personalization happens. Here, a score for each story is calculated independently, and then all 500 posts are put in order by score. For some, the score may be higher for likes than for commenting, as some people like to express themselves more through liking than commenting. Any action a person rarely engages in (for instance, a like prediction that’s very close to zero) automatically gets a minimal role in ranking, as the predicted value is very low. Finally, we run the contextual pass, in which contextual features like content type diversity rules are added to make sure Juan’s News Feed has a good mix of content types and he’s not seeing multiple video posts, one after another. All these ranking steps happen in the time it takes for Juan to open the Facebook app, and within seconds, he has a scored News Feed that’s ready for him to browse and enjoy."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/new-destination-for-news-in-the-uk/","date":"2021-01-24T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"A New Destination for News in the UK","text":"Later today, across the UK we will begin rolling out Facebook News, a destination within the Facebook app that features news from hundreds of leading national, local and lifestyle outlets.

This is the beginning of a series of international investments in news. We’re also announcing a number of new partners for Facebook News, including Channel 4 News, Daily Mail Group, DC Thomson, Financial Times, Sky News and Telegraph Media Group. These are in addition to outlets already announced including The Economist, The Guardian, The Independent, STV and hundreds of local news sites from Archant, Iliffe, JPI Media, Midlands News Association and Reach as well as lifestyle outlets such as GQ, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Vogue and many more. With Facebook News, people in the UK will see the top headlines and stories of the day next to news personalised to their interests. During major news cycles, Facebook News provides timely news digests, highlighting original and authoritative reporting on the biggest stories. For example, we’re currently highlighting a collection of COVID-19-specific stories, giving people access to timely and relevant news and information about the pandemic. Facebook News gives people control over the stories they see in the app and the ability to explore news on a wide range of topics from a variety of news outlets.

Key features of Facebook News include: Today’s stories chosen by a team of journalists to catch up on the latest news as it breaks throughout the day Personalisation based on the news you read, share and follow, so you can find new interests and topics from your favourite news outlets or publications you haven’t previously followed, creating a fresh and interesting experience every time News sections to dive deeper into business, entertainment, health, science & tech and sport Controls to make sure you see the articles, topics or publishers you want to see and hide those you don’t. We’ve been partnering with news organisations for many years and our goal has always been to work out the best ways we can support the industry in building sustainable business models. This product is a result of those conversations. As we invest more in news and pay publishers for more content in more countries, we will work with them to support the long term viability of newsrooms. We also recently announced we’re extending the Community News Project for another year. The £2.25 million annual training fund in partnership with the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ) trained reporters in 80 local newsrooms across the UK, building on the initial £4.5 million investment. Facebook News was built to bring people closer to the stories that impact their lives and the community around them. Our aim is to build on our efforts to sustain great national and local journalism and create more value for publishers. We’ll continue to learn, listen and improve Facebook News as it rolls out across the UK and into other markets, including France and Germany, where we are in active negotiations with partners. In order to bring Facebook News and other news products that help publishers transition in the digital age to more countries, it is critical that regulatory environments invite this kind of investment and innovation.

This means automatic alt text will still be able to recognize when a person is in a photo, but it will no longer include names of people. Originally posted on January 19, 2021 at 10:00 AM PT: When Facebook users scroll through their News Feed, they find all kinds of content — articles, friends’ comments, event invitations, and of course, photos. Most people are able to instantly see what’s in these images, whether it’s their new grandchild, a boat on a river, or a grainy picture of a band onstage. But many users who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) can also experience that imagery, provided it’s tagged properly with alternative text (or “alt text”). A screen reader can describe the contents of these images using a synthetic voice and enable people who are BVI to understand images in their Facebook feed. Unfortunately, many photos are posted without alt text, so in 2016 we introduced a new technology called automatic alternative text (AAT). AAT — which was recognized in 2018 with the Helen Keller Achievement Award from the American Foundation for the Blind — utilizes object recognition to generate descriptions of photos on demand so that blind or visually impaired individuals can more fully enjoy their News Feed. We’ve been improving it ever since and are excited to unveil the next generation of AAT. The latest iteration of AAT represents multiple technological advances that improve the photo experience for our users. First and foremost, we’ve expanded the number of concepts that AAT can reliably detect and identify in a photo by more than 10x, which in turn means fewer photos without a description. Descriptions are also more detailed, with the ability to identify activities, landmarks, types of animals, and so forth — for example, “May be a selfie of 2 people, outdoors, the Leaning Tower of Pisa.” And we’ve achieved an industry first by making it possible to include information about the positional location and relative size of elements in a photo. So instead of describing the contents of a photo as “May be an image of 5 people,” we can specify that there are two people in the center of the photo and three others scattered toward the fringes, implying that the two in the center are the focus. Or, instead of simply describing a lovely landscape with “May be a house and a mountain,” we can highlight that the mountain is the primary object in a scene based on how large it appears in comparison with the house at its base. Taken together, these advancements help users who are blind or visually impaired better understand what’s in photos posted by their family and friends — and in their own photos — by providing more (and more detailed) information. Where we Started The concept of alt text dates back to the early days of the internet, providing slow dial-up connections with a text alternative to downloading bandwidth-intensive images. Of course, alt text also helped people who are blind or visually impaired navigate the internet, since it can be used by screen reader software to generate spoken image descriptions. Unfortunately, faster internet speeds made alt text less of a priority for many users. And since these descriptions needed to be added manually by whoever uploaded an image, many photos began to feature no alt text at all — with no recourse for the people who had relied on it. Nearly five years ago, we leveraged Facebook’s computer vision expertise to help solve this problem. The first version of AAT was developed using human-labeled data, with which we trained a deep convolutional neural network using millions of examples in a supervised fashion. Our completed AAT model could recognize 100 common concepts, like “tree,” “mountain,” and “outdoors.” And since people who use Facebook often share photos of friends and family, our AAT descriptions used facial recognition models that identified people (as long as those people gave explicit opt-in consent). For people who are BVI, this was a giant step forward. Seeing More of the World But we knew there was more that AAT could do, and the next logical step was to expand the number of recognizable objects and refine how we described them. To achieve this, we moved away from fully supervised learning with human-labeled data. While this method delivers precision, the time and effort involved in labeling data are extremely high — and that’s why our original AAT model reliably recognized only 100 objects. Recognizing that this approach would not scale, we needed a new path forward. For our latest iteration of AAT, we leveraged a model trained on weakly supervised data in the form of billions of public Instagram images and their hashtags. To make our models work better for everyone, we fine-tuned them so that data was sampled from images across all geographies, and using translations of hashtags in many languages. We also evaluated our concepts along gender, skin tone, and age axes. The resulting models are both more accurate and culturally and demographically inclusive — for instance, they can identify weddings around the world based (in part) on traditional apparel instead of labeling only photos featuring white wedding dresses. It also gave us the ability to more readily repurpose machine learning models as the starting point for training on new tasks — a process known as transfer learning. This enabled us to create models that identified concepts such as national monuments, food types (like fried rice and french fries), and selfies. This entire process wouldn’t have been possible in the past. To get richer information like position and counts, we also trained a two-stage object detector, called Faster R-CNN, using Detectron2, an open source platform for object detection and segmentation developed by Facebook AI Research. We trained the models to predict locations and semantic labels of the objects within an image. Multilabel/multi–data set training techniques helped make our model more reliable with the larger label space. The improved AAT reliably recognizes over 1,200 concepts — more than 10 times as many as the original version we launched in 2016. As we consulted with screen reader users regarding AAT and how best to improve it, they made it clear that accuracy is paramount. To that end, we’ve included only those concepts for which we could ensure well-trained models that met a certain high threshold of precision. While there is a margin for error, which is why we start every description with “May be,” we’ve set the bar very high and have intentionally omitted concepts that we couldn’t reliably identify. We want to give our users who are blind or visually impaired as much information as possible about a photo’s contents — but only correct information. Delivering Details Having increased the number of objects recognized while maintaining a high level of accuracy, we turned our attention to figuring out how to best describe what we found in a photo. We asked users who depend on screen readers how much information they wanted to hear and when they wanted to hear it. They wanted more information when an image is from friends or family, and less when it’s not. We designed the new AAT to provide a succinct description for all photos by default but offer an easy way to get more detailed descriptions about photos of specific interest. When users select that latter option, a panel is presented that provides a more comprehensive description of a photo’s contents, including a count of the elements in the photo, some of which may not have been mentioned in the default description. Detailed descriptions also include simple positional information — top/middle/bottom or left/center/right — and a comparison of the relative prominence of objects, described as “primary,” “secondary,” or “minor.” These words were specifically chosen to minimize ambiguity. Feedback on this feature during development showed that using a word like “big” to describe an object could be confusing because it’s unclear whether the reference is to its actual size or its size relative to other objects in an image. Even a Chihuahua looks large if it’s photographed up close! AAT uses simple phrasing for its default description rather than a long, flowy sentence. It’s not poetic, but it is highly functional. Our users can read and understand the description quickly — and it lends itself to translation so all the alt text descriptions are available in 45 different languages, ensuring that AAT is useful to people around the world. Facebook is for Everyone Every day, our users share billions of photos. The ubiquity of inexpensive cameras in mobile phones, fast wireless connections, and social media products like Instagram and Facebook have made it easy to capture and share photography and help make it one of the most popular ways to communicate — including for individuals who are blind or visually impaired. While we wish everyone who uploaded a photo would include an alt text description, we recognize that this often doesn’t happen. We built AAT to bridge this gap, and the impact it’s had on those who need it is immeasurable. AI promises extraordinary advances, and we’re excited to have the opportunity to bring these advances to communities that are so often underserved."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/introducing-the-new-access-your-information/","date":"2021-01-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing the New Access Your Information","text":"Over the years, we’ve developed tools to make it easier for people to view and download data on how they’ve used our services. We first launched Access Your Information in 2018 so that people could have a central place to access their information on Facebook. Now that we’ve had some time to learn about how people use it, we’ve reorganized and given it a new coat of paint, so that it’s even more usable and transparent. We want to make sure that your information on Facebook is useful, easy to understand and easy to find. So what’s new? Instead of two broad categories of data (Your Information and Information About You), we’ve broken them out into eight categories: Your Activity Across Facebook Friends and Followers Preferences Personal Information Logged Information Ads Information Apps and Websites Off of Facebook Security and Login Information Each of these categories breaks down further into subcategories, so it should be much easier to navigate to the data type you’re interested in. We’ve also added search functionality. You can now find data categories simply by searching for them. For example, if you start searching for information about your location history, searching for “location” should start generating some suggestions. We are also adding information about how your data may be used to personalize your experience on Facebook. For example, you might see that your primary location was one of multiple signals that informed a recent ad you saw for a food delivery app. This information is already available in our Why Am I Seeing This tool, but we wanted to make it easier for people to discover. All of these changes were made in response to our own research that showed us how people interacted with Access Your Information already — for example, the new categories were developed based on what people were already clicking on. The revamped Access Your Information is now available on iOS and Android, and will be available on other platforms soon. It’s important to us to keep making it easier for people to understand and access their data on Facebook, so we’ll keep updating our tools whenever we can to make sure that people can continue to access their data in meaningful ways."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/ensembleauspectacle-theaters-are-closed-but-the-show-goes-on-with-facebook/","date":"2021-01-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","EMEA"],"title":"#EnsembleAuSpectacle: Theaters Are Closed, But the Show Goes on With Facebook","text":"Performances of “Le Petit Coiffeur” (“The Young Hairdresser”) by Jean-Philippe Daguerre were suspended when theaters closed, but the play will be shown live on Facebook on January 17. The Théâtre Rive Gauche (Left Bank Theater) in Paris invites you to get your tickets for €8.99 through the Paid Online Events tool on Facebook. Paris Opera Ballet productions were presented during a special paid performance on Facebook last November, and now you can go to the Théâtre Rive Gauche in Paris on January 17 at 3:30PM, for a unique performance of the play Le Petit Coiffeur, by Jean-Philippe Daguerre. Although the arts were plunged into crisis with the continued closure of theaters, the Théâtre Rive Gauche rallied to continue its activities and offer its audience this play, which was only able to be shown for a few weeks before it was indefinitely suspended last October 30. The theater and the company are offering Facebook users a unique, up-close and interactive experience with the artists and the playwright through the Paid Online Events function on Facebook. ‘Le Petit Coiffeur,’ Jean-Philippe Daguerre’s New Play Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt (Artistic Director of the Théâtre Rive Gauche), Jean-Philippe Daguerre (writer and director), as well as actors Félix Beauperin, Arnaud Dupont, Brigitte Faure, Romain Lagarde and Charlotte Matzneff, and the whole theater team give you an opportunity to bring this play to life once again on Facebook. A cross between a dramatic comedy and a historical play, this 1 hour and 20 minute contemporary work was written by Jean-Philippe Daguerre. He is the writer of more than thirty plays, including “Adieu Monsieur Haffmann” (“Farewell Mister Haffmann”), which received the Barrière Foundation prize and 4 Molière Awards in 2018. The play’s text was also published as a book by the Albin Michel publishing house. In “Le Petit Coiffeur,” Chartres has just been liberated from the German Occupation in August 1944. In the Giraud family, hairdressing is passed down from father to son, so Pierre has to take over the men’s hair salon from his father, who died in a labor camp a year earlier. His mother, Marie, a heroine of the French Resistance, is in charge of the women’s salon, but also refers some clients to her son in order to participate in a very specific activity. Everything is going well, until Lise enters their lives. Daguerre was inspired to write this play when he saw “La Tondue de Chartres” (“The Shaved Woman of Chartres”), a famous photo taken by Robert Capa on the streets of Chartres, showing a woman whose head was shaved during the Liberation carrying her three-month-old baby. He imagined the fictional story of a young hairdresser who had to shave this woman’s head against his will. The writer sought to find a poetic approach to this tragic story in order to evoke smiles and even laughter. “I would like to thank Facebook from the bottom of my heart for letting us show ‘Le Petit Coiffeur’ during a special live session at the Théâtre Rive Gauche. The performance will have a special meaning in this time of cultural drought, since we don’t know when the next one will be. You can imagine how badly we wanted to get back on stage to share our excitement for this occasion with our Facebook audience. Long live theater!” — Writer/Director Jean-Philippe Daguerre “In spite of the ongoing closure of theaters, the Théâtre Rive Gauche wants to stay connected to the public, and so we are offering a special live Facebook broadcast of the play ‘Le Petit Coiffeur’ from Paris. It opened to great critical acclaim in October and was tremendously successful with the audience. Then the curtain suddenly closed. We’ll be back as soon as possible but now the journey continues! Actors, technicians and stage managers are ready to revive the live performance Sunday on Facebook.” — Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, Artistic Director of the Théâtre Rive Gauche Buy Your Ticket and Explore Backstage on Facebook People can follow these steps to access the paid online event on Facebook: Log into Facebook, being sure to use the latest version of the Facebook app Go to the Théâtre Rive Gauche Page Click on the event, then on the “Purchase” button, and follow the instructions to complete the payment via Facebook Pay, the Apple Store or the Google Play Store Before and after the performance, the audience will be able to go behind the scenes of the theater and explore the preparations for this special event with Daguerre. They can also interact with the writer and director, as well as the actors during a question-and-answer session at the end of the performance. All proceeds from this performance will go to the Théâtre Rive Gauche and Facebook will not receive any payment. #EnsembleAuSpectacle Initiative Supports Cultural Organizations “The arts have been going through an incredibly difficult time for almost a year, and we have a duty to provide support by allowing actors to sustain economic activities using our tools. We are delighted that the Théâtre Rive Gauche and the Petit Coiffeur company are coming together today to present their play to the public in a different way using the paid online events Facebook function.” — Edouard Braud, Director of Entertainment Partnerships for France and Southern Europe at Facebook The world of culture and performing arts has successfully maintained its connection to the public through the #EnsembleÀLaMaison (#TogetherAtHome) initiative launched by Facebook in 2020 during the first lockdown. Cultural organizations need to continue generating revenue now more than ever. That is why Facebook developed the Paid Online Events function in the summer of 2020, allowing artists, creators, businesses and media organizations to get paid through Facebook by creating an event, setting a price, promoting the event and collecting payment all in one place."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/introducing-the-new-page-experience/","date":"2021-01-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing the New Pages Experience","text":"Today, we’re rolling out the redesigned Facebook Pages experience that makes it simpler for public figures and creators to build community and achieve their business objectives. What’s New: Redesigned layout that’s simpler and more intuitive Dedicated News Feed to discover and join conversations, follow trends, interact with peers and engage with fans Easy navigation between personal profile and Pages Updated task-based admin controls giving trusted Page admins full control or partial access Actionable insights and more relevant notifications Safety and integrity features to detect spammy content and impersonator accounts Simple and Intuitive Page Design Now it’s easy to navigate between a personal profile and public Page. We’ve redesigned the look and feel to be cleaner and more streamlined than before — including making it simple for people to see bios, posts and other important info. Dedicated News Feed and New Ways to Engage We are bringing the power of News Feed to Pages for the first time. Now Pages can discover and join conversations, follow trends, interact with peers and engage with fans. The dedicated News Feed will also suggest new connections — other public figures, Pages, Groups and trending content that a Page or public figure cares about. To make Page conversations more visible to a wider audience and surfaced more frequently in their followers’ News Feed, comments from public figures will be bumped to the top of the comments section. People will also be able to follow Pages directly from comments and recommendations posts. New Q&A Format To support richer, interactive conversations, we are also introducing a new text-based Q&A format. Focus on Page Followers We are removing Likes and focusing on Followers to simplify the way people connect with their favorite Pages. Unlike Likes, Followers of a Page represent the people who can receive updates from Pages, which helps give public figures a stronger indication of their fan base. Improved Page Management Tools We’ve added new Page management features — like the ability to more clearly assign and manage admin access permissions based on specific tasks. For example, you’ll now be able to grant varying levels of access to manage specific tasks including Insights, Ads, Content, and Community Activity & Messages. This will also ensure account safety and integrity. Safety and Integrity Features We want Facebook to be a safe place to connect with fans, so we’ve improved our ability to detect activity that isn’t allowed on our platform including hate speech, violent, sexual or spammy content and impersonation. We are continuing to expand the visibility of a verified badge to make it easier to identify posts and comments from authentic Pages and profiles. A verified Page’s comment on another Page’s public post, may appear higher in the comments section and be visible in News Feed. How to Transition and Learn More This is just the beginning — we’ll continue to roll out the new Pages experience to all Pages in the upcoming months.

There were fewer crowds celebrating in the streets around the world. Instead, more people spent a cozy night at home looking back on a difficult year and hoping for brighter days ahead. Despite so many being apart from friends and family due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people were still able to connect with each other the same way they’ve been connecting all year: through online video and audio calling, and in record numbers. In 2020, people turned to technology to stay in touch and get things done in the face of social distancing and stay-at-home mandates, and video calling became arguably the most in-demand feature. At Facebook, we saw surges in video chatting all year across Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, and last night was no exception. New Year’s Eve is a historically busy night for our services, but this year set new records. “Before COVID-19, New Year’s Eve generated Facebook’s biggest spikes in messaging, photo uploads and social sharing at midnight across the world. However, in March 2020, the early days of the pandemic produced traffic spikes that would dwarf New Year’s Eve several times over — and it lasted for months. Behind the scenes, Facebook Engineering came together to drive unprecedented efficiency improvements and make our infrastructure more resilient. This work includes load testing, disaster recovery testing and shuffling capacity. This year, New Year’s Eve looked a lot different, and we had engineering teams across Facebook’s apps, ready to support any issue, so the world could ring in 2021.” – Caitlin Banford, technical program manager at Facebook Here’s a breakdown on how people celebrated using our apps: WhatsApp More than 1.4 billion voice and video calls were made on New Year’s Eve 2020 globally, the most ever calls in a single day on WhatsApp. WhatsApp calling increased over 50% compared to the same day last year. Messenger People celebrated with effects in Messenger, and the top AR effect in the US was “2020 Fireworks.” New Year’s Eve 2020 was the biggest day ever for Messenger group video calls (3+ people) in the US, with nearly 2X more group video calls on NYE compared to the average day. Instagram Live and Facebook Live There were more than 55 million live broadcasts across Facebook and Instagram globally on New Year’s Eve. Happy New Year from all of us at Facebook.

Originally published on December 15, 2020 at 11:30AM PT: We are maintaining our temporary pause for ads about social issues, elections or politics in the US. However, in recent weeks we’ve heard feedback from experts and advertisers across the political spectrum about the importance of expressing voice and using our tools to reach voters ahead of Georgia’s runoff elections. We agree that our ad tools are an important way for people to get information about these elections. So we have developed a process to allow advertisers to run ads with the purpose of reaching voters in Georgia about Georgia’s runoff elections. Starting tomorrow, Wednesday December 16 at 9AM PT, we will begin enabling advertisers who are authorized to run ads about social issues, elections or politics to run ads specifically in Georgia. We will prioritize onboarding advertisers with direct involvement in these elections, including the campaigns, state and local elections officials, and state and national political parties. Advertisers who have previously completed the authorizations process to run these types of ads and have a need to run them for these elections, can learn more here. We will reject ads that target locations outside of Georgia or that are not about the elections for violating our Advertising Policies. And, we will continue to prohibit any ad that includes content debunked by third-party fact-checkers or delegitimizes the Georgia runoff elections. Applying Our Playbook for Protecting Elections and Empowering Voters in Georgia We’re also helping people register and vote in Georgia by putting reliable information at the top of Facebook and Instagram. This included information about how and when to register ahead of last week’s deadline, and how to request a mail ballot. Starting this week, we’re showing people how to find polling place times and locations for early voting, followed by how to return their mail ballots, then how to vote on Election Day. Our notifications link to the Georgia Secretary of State’s website and are available in English and Spanish on Facebook and Instagram, as well as several additional languages on Facebook. We will also label content that tries to delegitimize voting in these elections. This includes content with claims like, “vote-by-mail leads to fraud.” When we become aware of content like this, we will add a label to it from the Bipartisan Policy Center with accurate information that addresses the underlying claim. And, if someone goes to share the content we have labeled, they will first see a message directing them to our Voting Information Center, which provides reliable election information. Finally, we are deploying the teams and technology we used in the general election to fight voter suppression, misinformation and interference in the Georgia elections. This includes: Running our Elections Operations Center for the Georgia runoffs, to monitor and respond to threats in real time. Stopping influence operations by taking down coordinated networks of inauthentic accounts, Pages and Groups that seek to manipulate the public debate. Working with state election authorities to identify and stop potential instances of voter suppression. Providing our Voting Alerts tool to state and local election officials in Georgia to send notifications about the election to people on Facebook in their jurisdiction. Enforcing our voter interference policies through a combination of AI and human review to find and remove content which breaks our rules. Applying warning labels in both Spanish and English to content that our fact-checking partners rate false or partially false. Protecting the accounts of election officials from harassment and other threats, in addition to our Facebook Protect program, which offers security tools and additional protections to safeguard the Facebook and Instagram accounts of campaigns, elected officials, federal and state political party committees, and staff."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/launching-facebook-news-in-the-uk/","date":"2020-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Stepping Up Our Investment in News in the UK","text":"Launching Facebook News in the UK in January 2021 and Extending Community News Project Today, we’re announcing new investments focused on journalism in the UK with the launch of Facebook News, a dedicated space for national and local news, coming in January 2021. With Facebook News, we will pay publishers for content that is not already on the platform, help publishers reach new audiences and bring more advertising and subscription opportunities. The first group of publishers featured in Facebook News in the UK includes Archant, Conde Nast, The Economist, ESI Media, Guardian Media Group, Hearst, Iliffe, JPI Media, Midland News Association, Reach, STV and others. These publishers are home to hundreds of the UK’s best known and most loved national and local news brands, including The Economist, The Guardian, The Independent, The London Evening Standard, Liverpool Echo, Manchester Evening News, The Mirror, The Scotsman, STV and the Yorkshire Post amongst others. Facebook News will also include content from lifestyle brands such as Red, Harpers, Cosmopolitan, Wired, GQ, Glamour, Vogue and Tatler. We expect many more partners to join prior to launch. Facebook News offers a mix of curated and personalised top stories to deliver informative, reliable and relevant news. Readers see the top headlines and stories of the day alongside news personalised to their interests. During major news cycles, Facebook News provides timely news digests, highlighting original and authoritative reporting on pressing topics. Facebook News also helps people discover new topics and stories based on the news they read, share and follow. The UK launch in January will build on the success Facebook News has seen in the US, where we’ve found more than 95% of the traffic Facebook News delivers to publishers is new audiences that have not interacted with those news outlets in the past. Facebook is committed to supporting news organisations as they adapt to the changing digital world, and we are delighted to have so many partners working with us at this early stage. We’re in active negotiations to bring Facebook News to France and Germany as well, and we will continue to work with publishers in countries where market conditions and regulatory environments invite this kind of investment and innovation. Zach Leonard, Chief Executive, The Independent commented: “Innovation is at the heart of everything we do at The Independent, from moving to digital-only in 2016, to becoming Britain’s largest quality digital news brand, with an average monthly global audience of 101m unique browsers. We are delighted to extend The Independent’s longstanding strategic partnership with Facebook through the UK launch of Facebook News, helping to bring high-quality and trustworthy news to its UK users.” David Higgerson, Chief Audience Officer, Reach PLC (150 news brands including The Mirror, the Express, Daily Star, Manchester Evening News, Liverpool Echo, Birmingham Mail, Bristol Post and Daily Record) said: “We welcome the introduction of the Facebook News Tab in the UK as a sign of Facebook’s commitment to ensuring that accurate, well-researched journalism is given prominence on its platform.” Bobby Hain, Managing Director, Broadcast at STV said: “STV News is one of the most trusted sources of news in Scotland. Millions of Scots rely on our programmes and digital platforms to keep them up-to-date and informed. We are delighted to be a launch partner for Facebook News and to be delivering relevant, reliable and engaging Scottish content to users of this innovative new service.” UK Community News Project Extended Throughout the global pandemic the need for reliable, authoritative local news has proven more important than ever. For the past two years, Facebook has trained 80 journalists across the UK covering communities traditionally underserved by news media through the $6M/£4.5M Community News Project (CNP). Now we are pleased to announce a year long extension to the CNP with an additional $3M/£2.25M to support local journalism. The pilot program enabled the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ) to oversee the recruitment of more than 80 trainee community journalists and place them in nearly 80 local newsrooms. The NCTJ and publishers focused on finding trainees from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds to reflect the diversity of the local communities they serve. In fact, at least 68% of the reporters hired in the pilot program, met one or more of the diversity criteria being measured. To date, the journalists in the CNP have collectively produced hundreds of front pages and 80% of reporters have achieved print front page bylines or homepage leads within three months of starting in their post. The extension means just over half of the existing cohort, who came in as trainees to study for the Diploma in Journalism, could be in line for an additional year of training. Those trainees will work towards the senior level National Qualification in Journalism (NQJ). Meanwhile, dozens of new reporters will be recruited to train in some of the UK’s leading newsrooms as they study for NCTJ qualifications. More information on the CNP extension can be found here."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/what-do-people-actually-see-on-facebook-in-the-us/","date":"2020-11-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook"],"title":"What Do People Actually See on Facebook in the US?","text":"Update on November 4, 2022 at 1:15PM PT: Our latest analysis shows that less than 3% of the content people in the US see in their Facebook Feed is political in nature, down from 6% when measured in 2020. Originally published on November 10, 2020 at 2:30PM PT: I would like to provide a little more detail on what people have seen on Facebook leading up to the election as there are questions out there about this. The vast majority of what people in the US see on Facebook is in their News Feed. Most of the content people see there, even in an election season, is not about politics. In fact, based on our analysis, political content makes up about 6% of what you see on Facebook. This includes posts from friends or from Pages (which are public profiles created by businesses, brands, celebrities, media outlets, causes and the like). For example, Halloween had twice the increase in posting we saw on Election Day, even though Facebook prompted people at the top of their News Feed (a number of times) to post about voting. Using Facebook’s own tool, CrowdTangle, you can retrieve data about which Page posts are engaged with the most. This tool was built to help people get some idea of what content will get likes, comments and reshares. But it is not designed to show what is being seen the most. Ranking top Page posts by reactions, comments, etc. doesn’t paint a full picture of what people actually see on Facebook. There are at least two limitations in using CrowdTangle to understand what works on Facebook more broadly than the specific questions the tool was built to answer: Likes and comments don’t equate to reach. Our ranking models include much more than just engagement. For example, they can include survey results, like when we ask people whether a post was worth their time. Page posts are a minority of what goes on in our ecosystem (platform). Much of the public discussion around what performs best on Facebook focuses on posts from Pages with the most engagement and which also contain links to other content elsewhere. Here is a popular example: https://twitter.com/facebookstop10. But this is a subset of Page posts and I don’t think that these lists are fully representative of the Pages ecosystem (even if you’re looking only at engagement). If you look at the top performing US-based Pages based on their global engagement with all posts (and not just posts with web links), you get quite a different list. For example: Joe Biden, Occupy Democrats and Donald J Trump jump into the top ten, while Ben Shapiro and USA Patriots for Donald Trump drop out of the top ten. To show the full picture though, we think it’s important to look at how many people actually see the content (vs. liking or sharing a piece of content). We call this reach. We wanted to share some additional data to help round out the picture. Here are lists of the US news publishers and the US-based Pages (based on the domain in their URL) who reached the most people in the US in the week following the last presidential debate. As you can see, the publishers and Pages with the most reach are two very different lists. These two groups are also very different from the Pages with the most engagement, as shown in the first list above. Engagement does not predict reach. (You can find additional explanation in these articles about personalization in News Feed, public comments and reducing the spread of problematic content.) We believe this list is more indicative of what people actually see on Facebook, and the publishers listed are more indicative of which outlets people see on Facebook dealing with politics. Overall we believe this paints a more complete picture than the CrowdTangle data alone, which was never supposed to show the reach of content on Facebook. We believe this shows the actual balance of what people saw on Facebook in the week before the election, which we think is a reasonable (but not perfect) reflection of the election in general. We have also seen public comments on changes to the Pages that were getting the most engagement in the period just after the election results were called. Some Pages like the New York Times, NPR, CNN and the Washington Post saw really big spikes in engagement. Some had massive spikes on the day election results were announced, but generally declined after the race was called for Joe Biden. A smaller effect appears to have been due to the temporary measures we put in place to address potential misinformation and delegitimizing content on our platform related to the election. We are now seeing these lists return to a state similar to what we saw before the election while our temporary measures remain in place. We believe this means that the hypothesis around big spikes in engagement is likely the most important factor, as the other measures mentioned are ongoing. One point I found heartening in preparing this data was this quote from one of our data scientists. Following the announcement of a winner, ‘Americans applying heart reactions on political content were off the charts, while angry reactions were closer to baseline.’ It’s possible to have a spike in positivity without having a corresponding spike in negativity. There has been a lot of interest in Facebook’s impact on civic discourse and reasonable requests for us to share more data so it can be studied more fully. Obviously, this post is not meant to be a perfect analysis. In response to those requests we are partnering through the Facebook Open Research and Transparency (FORT) project with a group of researchers from a number of preeminent universities. They are leading a series of privacy-protected experiments and conducting analysis into what happened on Facebook during this election cycle. We hope the first research papers will be published next year and will provide a better understanding than the rough analysis we are showing here. Following Cambridge Analytica, it is clear how careful we need to be about partnering with researchers and giving them access to data. It is also clear that following the last presidential election we need to have independent research to understand our role in elections. This partnership through FORT is a step in that direction and (although nothing is perfect) one I am really proud of. I hope it can serve as a base from which we can build for the future, to thread the needle on the needs of privacy and research."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/cloud-gaming-meet-facebook-gaming/","date":"2020-10-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Cloud Gaming, Meet Facebook Gaming","text":"New Games in a Fresh Destination for Play on Facebook Today we’re announcing that we’ve launched several cloud-streamed games in the Facebook app and on browser — playable instantly, with no downloads required. We recently had 200,000 people playing our cloud-streamed games per week in limited regions, so while it’s not exactly a secret, I’m excited to lay out what we’re building. But first, I want to clarify what we’re not doing: we’re not spinning off a separate cloud gaming service. All cloud-streamed games are playable in the same way you play games now on Facebook — whether it’s in our Gaming tab or from News Feed. No special hardware or controllers needed – your hands are the controllers since we’re launching with native mobile games. And you can play these games with a mouse and keyboard on desktop. More than 380 million people play games each month on Facebook, and people will play cloud-streamed games right alongside those playing instant games in HTML5. And if we do our jobs right, you won’t notice how the games are delivered. Here are some highlights: Free-to-Play Cloud Games Launching in Beta on Android and Web at fb.gg/play (we’re not launching on iOS … for now): Our first set of games available this week include Asphalt 9: Legends by Gameloft; Mobile Legends: Adventure by Moonton; PGA TOUR Golf Shootout by Concrete Software, Inc.; Solitaire: Arthur’s Tale by Qublix Games; and WWE SuperCard by 2K Games. In the coming weeks we’ll add Dirt Bike Unchained by Red Bull, and we’ll continue to test new experiences and expand the games library. Player Names and Cross-Play: For the first time on Facebook, we’re introducing player names and gaming-themed avatars for players to represent themselves in game instead of using their full name and profile picture. And, all developers integrating Facebook Login for Gaming can enable cross-play between the downloaded version of their game and the cloud version on Facebook. Cloud Playable Ads Launching on Android and iOS in the US: Building on our HTML5 playable ads format, we’re launching cloud playable ads.

Since the launch of Facebook Dating, over 1.5 billion matches have been created in the 20 countries where the feature is available. Facebook Dating is a dedicated, opt-in space within the Facebook app, and you can create a Facebook Dating profile in just a few taps. Facebook Dating makes it easier to share your true self and gives you a more authentic look at who someone is. Some key features include: Stories: Stories in Dating enable you to share moments from your everyday life so you can find a meaningful connection with someone who is interested in what you’re into. If you choose to share Facebook or Instagram Stories on your Dating profile, you can show, rather than tell, people who you are and get to know someone better before and after you match. Secret Crush: The Secret Crush feature lets you explore potential relationships with people you already know on Facebook and/or Instagram. Facebook Dating won’t suggest your Facebook friends as potential matches, but if you choose to use Secret Crush, you can select up to nine of your Facebook friends or Instagram followers who you’re interested in. If your crush adds you to their Secret Crush list too, it’s a match! If your crush isn’t on Dating, doesn’t create a Secret Crush list or doesn’t put you on their list — then your crush will not know that you’ve entered their name. Events and Groups: You can choose to see other people who are using Facebook Dating with similar interests by opting in to add your Facebook events and groups to Dating. So if you’re looking for a fellow dog lover, you can see others using Dating who are also in the pet owner groups you’re in. Virtual Dates: So you’ve matched with someone in Dating, and you’re ready to video chat with each other. We’re rolling out a feature where you can start a video chat with your match by tapping on the video icon in your chat. Starting the call will send an invitation, and once they accept, they will join your video call and you can get to know each other better. Your first name and Dating profile photo will be displayed when starting the call. Finding a romantic partner is deeply personal, which is why we built Dating with safety, security and privacy at the forefront. We worked with experts in these areas to provide easy access to safety tips and build protections into Facebook Dating, including the ability to report and block anyone, as well as stopping people from sending photos, links, payments or videos in messages. We won’t suggest current Facebook friends as potential matches or notify them that you’ve joined Dating. For example, your Dating profile, Dating messages, and who you like or match with in Dating won’t appear on your Facebook News Feed. We’re committed to making Facebook Dating a place where people feel comfortable looking for a date and starting meaningful relationships. Learn more about how we’re protecting people’s privacy in Dating. Availability Today, Facebook Dating is rolling out to Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Facebook Dating is also currently available in 20 other countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Suriname, Thailand, the United States, Uruguay and Vietnam.

Facebook Dating is a dedicated space within the Facebook app to connect with others based on common interests, and find love through what you like. What Choices and Controls Do I Have? Dating is an opt-in experience. You choose whether you want to create a Facebook Dating profile, and you can delete your Dating profile at any time without deleting your Facebook account. To make the Dating experience safer and more authentic, your first name and age on your Dating profile come from your Facebook profile and can’t be edited in Dating. We don’t display your last name on your Dating profile. You can choose whether to share information such as your hometown, religion, occupation and more, on your Dating profile. You can also choose how you want to present yourself to potential matches, such as expressing yourself with a different gender identity from your Facebook profile. We don’t show your gender identity or your gender preferences on your Dating profile. You can choose to see potential matches that are members of the same Facebook groups as you or are interested in the same Facebook public events as you. When you have suggested matches in groups or events turned on, you may be seen as a suggested match for others in that group or event. You can also choose to add your Instagram feed or stories to your Dating profile. In addition, you can add your Instagram followers or Facebook friends to your Secret Crush list, which will allow you to match with them if they also add you to their Secret Crush list. How Does This Impact Data Collection and the Ads I See? Facebook Dating may suggest matches for you based on your activities, preferences and information in Dating and other Facebook Products. We may also use your activity in Dating to personalize your experience, including ads you may see, across Facebook Products. The exception to this is your religious views and the gender(s) you are interested in dating, which will not be used to personalize your experience on other Facebook Products. Who Sees My Information and Activity? We won’t suggest current Facebook friends as potential matches or notify them that you’ve joined Dating. For example, your Dating profile, Dating messages and who you like or match with in Dating won’t appear in your Facebook News Feed. You can choose whether or not you want Facebook friends of friends suggested as potential matches. If you opt out of the ‘Suggest friends of friends’ option, you will not see your Facebook friends’ friends as suggested matches.

While public health experts agree that we won’t have an approved and widely available COVID-19 vaccine for some time, there are steps that people can take to stay healthy and safe. That includes getting the seasonal flu vaccine. So today we’re announcing new steps as part of our continued work to help support vaccine efforts. These include: Launching a new flu vaccine information campaign on Facebook, including new product features that provide additional vaccine-related content Rejecting ads globally that discourage people from getting a vaccine Working with global health partners on campaigns to increase immunization rates “Vaccines have always been a global priority for UNICEF, and will be even more so as the world continues to battle COVID-19. Building demand for vaccination in communities worldwide is key to saving lives. Our collaboration with Facebook is part of our efforts to address vaccine misinformation and share resonant and reassuring information on vaccination.” – Diane Summers, Senior Advisor, Vaccine Acceptance & Demand, UNICEF Helping People Get Their Flu Shot Public health officials recommend that most people get a flu shot every year. This year, they think it is especially important to minimize the risk of concurrent flu and COVID-19. To help, we’ll be directing people to general information about the flu vaccine and how to get it, including the nearest location to get the vaccine in the US using our Preventive Health Tool. We’ll also be including sharable flu vaccine reminders and resources from health authorities in News Feed and within the COVID-19 Information Center. We’re starting this campaign in the US this week, and we’ll expand it to more countries and add new features in the coming weeks. Prohibiting Ads That Discourage Vaccines Today, we’re launching a new global policy that prohibits ads discouraging people from getting vaccinated. We don’t want these ads on our platform. Our goal is to help messages about the safety and efficacy of vaccines reach a broad group of people, while prohibiting ads with misinformation that could harm public health efforts. We already don’t allow ads with vaccine hoaxes that have been publicly identified by leading global health organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Now, if an ad explicitly discourages someone from getting a vaccine, we’ll reject it. Enforcement will begin over the next few days. Update on October 13, 2020 at 5:25PM PT: “Access to reliable information is important to ensure uptake of safe and effective vaccines. We welcome Facebook’s update of its vaccine ad policies to prohibit ads that discourage people from getting vaccinated.” – Aleksandra Kuzmanovic, Social Media Manager at the World Health Organization Ads that advocate for or against legislation or government policies around vaccines – including a COVID-19 vaccine – are still allowed. We’ll continue to require anyone running these ads to get authorized and include a ‘Paid for by’ label so people can see who is behind them. We regularly refine our approach around ads that are about social issues to capture debates and discussions around sensitive topics happening on Facebook. Vaccines are no different. While we may narrow enforcement in some areas, we may expand it in others. Amplifying the Voices of Public Health Partners With vaccination rates still low in many parts of the world, we’re working with global health organizations on vaccine education campaigns. This includes working with organizations including WHO and UNICEF on public health messaging campaigns to increase immunization rates. We’re working with WHO’s Vaccine Safety Network to train and support their network of vaccine partners to utilize Facebook to reach as many people as possible with public health messaging. Insights for Impact, which is part of the Facebook Data for Good Program, in collaboration with CrowdTangle will expand its partnership with UNICEF and other nonprofits to share aggregated insights from public posts to better understand how people are talking about vaccines. We will analyze this public conversation across genders, age brackets and regions. Early results from our pilot vaccine messaging work with UNICEF across 10 countries show that nonprofits can use this aggregated information from public posts to build public trust in vaccines. Expanding this program will help our partners deliver vaccine related content to many different communities. We will continue supporting vaccine efforts as part of our work to help the people who use our platform stay healthy and safe."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/honoring-coming-out-day/","date":"2020-10-06T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Meta","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Honoring Coming Out Day","text":"Every year on October 11, the LGBTQ+ community recognizes the significance of coming out and the importance of encouraging an environment of support and acceptance. For LGBTQ+ people, coming out is more than one day or one moment, it is a lifelong journey and an everyday act of courage, especially when there isn’t a visible LGBTQ+ community around them. This year for Coming Out Day, we’re sharing resources in partnership with LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, releasing new product features, premiering special programming on Facebook Watch and amplifying LGBTQ+ voices across our social channels. Providing Resources and Support on Instagram We partnered with PFLAG, It Gets Better Project and The Tegan and Sara Foundation to create new Instagram Guides offering tips on topics such as safety and support for those going through their coming out journey, as well as for their friends and family. These resources are now available in the Instagram Guides tab. The @pflag guide offers tips for parents and guardians to support the LGBTQ+ people in their lives. The @itgetsbetter guide shares actionable tips for the LGBTQ+ community on how to come out safely online and how to support those going through that journey. And the @teganandsarafoundation guide provides tips for LGBTQ+ young people on coming out safely and how to find supportive communities. The guide will highlight TSF community partners creating safe communities for LGBTQ+ youth. New Product Features on Facebook To help people express themselves and find relevant Coming Out Day content, we’re releasing new product features in the Facebook app including an animated Coming Out Day Facebook logo that will link to a custom hashtag feed for #ComingOut2020. The feed will surface relevant content and Facebook Group recommendations. We’re also adding new Coming Out Day-themed stickers to use in stories and feed. Coming Out Day 2020 on Facebook Watch Facebook Watch, in partnership with Emmy and Academy Award-winning Scout Productions, will premiere a one-hour special, Coming Out 2020, on Friday, October 9 on the Facebook App Page, hosted by music superstar Demi Lovato and fashion designer Tan France. Lovato and France will be joined by LGBTQ+ activists, allies, entertainers and others from around the world, sharing stories about their coming out journeys, and providing advice and messages of support. The special will also feature a musical performance by multi-platinum recording artist LP. Amplifying LGBTQ+ Voices Throughout the week on our social channels, we’ll highlight personal stories and amplify LGBTQ+ voices. We’ll share a series of stories on Facebook and Instagram, about coming out in unique environments and situations. From remote locations to cultural insularity to personal struggles, we’ll follow the stories of four people and how they found connections, positivity and even celebration in unexpected places. On the Facebook app Facebook Page, we’ll share content featuring LGBTQ+ Groups that are creating a sense of belonging, support and community for their members. And on @instagram, Markus Thormeyer (@lilmarquenis), Olympic swimmer and student at the University of British Columbia, will share how coming out made him a better athlete. We’ll also link to relevant resources for the LGBTQ+ community in our posts across our channels including: /Facebook, @Facebook, /Facebookapp, @Instagram and /LGBTQ. We encourage the LGBTQ+ community to continue amplifying the hashtag #ShareWithPride for Coming Out Day and beyond to elevate the global conversation about LGBTQ+ stories and challenges."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/privacy-matters-the-new-public-groups/","date":"2020-09-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Privacy Matters: The New Public Groups","text":"Facebook Groups have been around since 2010, and in that time, have helped people from all over the world connect. People turn to Private groups to come together around shared life experiences and build deeper connections, and people turn to Public Groups for more open communities on various topics. Today we announced a number of changes to Facebook Groups, including a new Public Groups experience that will begin testing in the coming months. This includes making it easier for people to discover and participate in all the interesting conversations happening in Public groups. We’ll start to surface related Public group discussions to you across the Facebook app, including in News Feed and in the updated Groups tab. People will also be able to join Public groups without having to wait for approval, though admins of those groups will still have control over who participates in their group, such as with the new Admin Assist feature. These changes will help people encounter diverse perspectives and engage in discussions with others with different backgrounds and life experiences. We will start testing these changes later this year. At that time, admins will have the option to include their groups in the new experience. Who sees my information and activity? Public Group posts may now get more distribution on and off Facebook so that more people can discover and join in on the conversation. The audience of Public Groups hasn’t changed. The content shared in Public groups is visible to anyone on and off Facebook, and the member list is visible to anyone on Facebook. With these changes, it is more likely that more people will see, and may interact with, the content posted to Public Groups. This includes people who may not be members of the group. Private groups remain the same, so only members can see who else is in the group and the content within. What choices and controls do I have? Group members always have the choice to accept or decline a group invite, and have full visibility into whether the group is Public or Private. If a group changes from Public to Private, members are notified. Private groups are not able to change to Public. Admins still have the option to change their group to private so that only other members can see the member list and content within the group. During the 72-hour transition time of requesting this change, any admin in the group will be able to reverse it. After 72 hours, this change is permanent and the group will become a Private group. How does the new Public Groups experience impact data collection? As with other parts of Facebook, we collect data from Public Groups to personalize your experience, including ads. Your data may be used to show you content from Public Groups that you may be interested in, such as posts and comments that are relevant to your interests. To learn more about the information Facebook collects and how it’s used, check out our Data Policy and How Ads Work."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/supporting-online-communities/","date":"2020-09-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Supporting Online Communities When They’re Needed Most","text":"Today, we are hosting the Facebook Communities Summit digitally, sharing product updates and educational resources for community leaders. As we approach the 10-year anniversary of Facebook Groups, we’re reminded how online communities can be a lifeline when people can’t be physically close. More than 1.8 billion people use Groups every month, and there are tens of millions of active communities on Facebook where people come together to talk about their interests, learn new things, be entertained and make connections. We know groups need to be safe for everyone, so we’ve made changes to reduce harmful content and misinformation, too. Here are the latest tools and programs we’re announcing today to help communities connect. More Tools for Group Admins Admins are at the heart of every community, whether they are Public or Private. In fact, there are more than 70 million people involved in building and running Facebook groups active in the past month. These new tools will help you manage your groups more efficiently. Admin Assist: Set rules so Facebook can help moderate posts in your group for you. For example, you can decline posts with certain keywords or from people who haven’t been in the group very long or whose posts have been reported in the past. New Topics: Organize content by topic with hashtags and pin a topic to the top of the group to highlight it for everyone. Branded Content for Public Groups: Use the Brand Collabs Manager to make money from your Public groups by connecting with brands looking to promote their products and services. Community Management Certification: Take an online course on how to build, grow and support your communities through a set curriculum and exam. New Ways to Engage With Your Community These new group features will help you spark discussions. Chats: Create and join real-time conversations within a group. Prompts: Start conversations with a new type of collaborative post where you can share photos about a specific topic and swipe through everyone’s responses. Q&A: Admins can host text-based question-and-answer sessions that are easy for the community to participate in. Customize your profile in groups: Change the way you show up in different groups by setting a custom profile photo and sharing info that’s relevant to each community. Discover and Join Conversations in Public Groups While Private groups can help people make deeper connections around shared life experiences, Public groups are open communities for people to share content related to trends, hobbies and humor. They bring together people with common interests, but they can also introduce people to diverse perspectives on the topics they’re into from others with different backgrounds and experiences. To help more people find and connect with communities, we’re going to start testing new ways for people to discover conversations in Public groups on and off Facebook. You might see Related Discussions in News Feed when someone posts a link or reshares a post on Facebook. This will let you dive deeper and see what other groups are saying about the same content. When you visit the Groups tab, you can see posts from Public groups related to your interests, as well as popular posts across Public groups, recommended to you. You’ll be able to see what people all over the world are saying about the big game, last night’s episode or your favorite band. You may start to see conversations from Public groups more outside of the Facebook app, like when you’re searching the web. From there, it’s easy to join the conversation without joining the group, as long as the community allows it. Admins still have control over their group settings, like who can post and comment without approval, and we’ll show people the group rules before they post so community culture stays strong. The new Admin Assist feature also makes it easy to limit specific types of posts. When we start to test this in the coming months, admins will have the option to include their groups in this new Public groups experience. During the opt-in process, you’ll be able to turn on post-approvals for your group, which will apply to everyone, including new members and non-members. Read more about the controls you have in our Privacy Matters post. Communities That Inspire During the Facebook Communities Summit, we heard inspiring stories from community leaders like Curtis Webster Jr. who founded Dads Married to Doctors (DMD), Ann Pettigrew, a member of What’s This Bird?, and Vitor Del Rey, admin of A Ponte Para Pretxs!.

Earlier this summer, state election officials warned of a massive shortage — almost half a million — because the majority of poll workers in previous elections were over 60 and at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. To make it easier for people to sign up with their state election authorities for this critical role, Facebook recently showed a message at the top of News Feed to people in the US over the age of 18. More than 1.7 million people clicked on the notification at the top of the Facebook app to sign up with their state authority. We estimate this helped about 100,000 people sign up as poll workers, based on conversion rates we calculated from a few states we’ve partnered with. Several states reported more details about how Facebook helped close their own poll worker gaps: North Carolina election officials told us that over 11,000 people signed up from Saturday to Monday morning, with 60,000 people clicking the link on Facebook. State officials have said they need at least 25,000 poll workers this year. South Carolina officials saw 20% of their total signups to-date over the weekend we ran our recruitment drive. Iowa saw a 15X surge in poll worker sign ups over the weekend we ran our recruitment drive. Michigan saw a 12-16X surge in poll worker sign ups, recruiting 5,000 people on the Saturday we ran the poll worker notification. Poll worker shortages can mean long wait times at the polls or fewer polling places, which makes it harder for people to participate in the democratic process, so Facebook is doing its part to fill this gap. We also offered free ad credits to every state election authority so they can recruit poll workers across our platforms. Several states have already started running these ads and more are planning to join. The Voting Information Center also includes details about how to sign up as a poll worker. With just about a month left until Election Day, we’ll continue helping people use their voices to vote by showing information about registration deadlines, deadlines to request a mail-in or absentee ballot and when to return it, early voting options, and information about how to vote on Election Day. This year we set an ambitious goal to help more than 4 million people register to vote. So far, we estimate we’ve helped 2.5 million people register across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, based on conversion rates we calculated from a few states we’ve partnered with. Now that people are voting, we’ve launched an Early Voting in Person feature in the Voting Information Center. Last week we added a notification at the top of Facebook, Instagram and Messenger to coincide with National Voter Registration Day with a link to their state authority’s website or a non-partisan organization where they can register. And as registration deadlines, which vary by state, are approaching, we will continue providing this information and an easy link for people to follow to make sure they are registered in time to make their voices heard."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/national-voter-registration-day/","date":"2020-09-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Election Integrity","Facebook","Instagram","Meta"],"title":"Celebrating National Voter Registration Day With a Week of Action","text":"Weeklong Registration Drive at the top of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger Apps to Help People Register for This Year’s US Election Launching New Consumer Marketing Campaign “More Questions, More Answers.” Facebook Watch Hosting a Virtual Vote-a-Thon Tomorrow is National Voter Registration Day, a time to celebrate our democracy and help people register to vote. But this year the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more important than ever for people to have accurate information about when and how to register and vote. That’s why Facebook has embarked on the largest voting information campaign in American history, with the goal of helping register 4 million eligible voters in the US this year. We estimate we’ve helped 2.5 million people register so far this year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, based on conversion rates we calculated from a few states we’ve partnered with. It’s a promising start, but we have more work to do. With six weeks until Election Day and registration deadlines fast approaching in many states, this week we’re putting the full force of our platform behind this campaign to empower every eligible voter to make their voice heard in this election. Using Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger to Help People Register Since last Saturday, we’ve been showing people in the US information about how to register at the top of the Facebook, Instagram and Messenger apps. These notifications take them to the relevant page with their state’s official website or one of our non-partisan partner organizations if online voter registration isn’t available in their state. We’ll keep showing these notifications through September 25, building on previous top-of-feed registration drives we ran this summer. We’re continuing to use all our apps on this effort — from launching the #PledgeToVoteChallenge on Facebook where people can show they’re planning to vote and tag their friends to nominate them to join the Challenge, to rolling out sticker packs so people can share in their Messenger chats or use in their Facebook and Instagram Stories to show how they’re participating and encourage their friends and family to do the same. On Instagram, those who use the new National Voter Registration Day stickers — launching tomorrow and created by artists from our community — will be added to a special Register To Vote story. Over the past few weeks, we’ve also been working with amazing Instagram artists to develop stickers about voting from requesting a mail ballot to letting your community know that you registered. To discover more fun stickers related to elections, simply visit the sticker tray in your stories. Launching a Consumer Awareness Campaign to Help Get Out the Vote Today, Facebook is kicking off a national campaign, “More Questions, More Answers.” It will encourage people to visit and use our Voting Information Centers to help ensure their vote is counted in this election. Facebook app and Instagram will also run campaigns on our platform to encourage people to visit the Voting Information Center. This is the first time we will run a campaign for our company and our apps together. The campaign launches today and will run across national broadcast, cable, radio and digital homepage takeovers within lifestyle and news outlets. Virtual Vote-a-Thon On Tuesday morning, Facebook Watch will kick off the special, Vote-A-Thon 2020 streamed on the Facebook App page. Hosted by Liza Koshy, the special reimagines the classic telethon with a “daisy chain” of calls between some of America’s most notable celebrities and public figures, all with the goal of helping people register and vote. Vote-A-Thon 2020 will also spotlight human interest stories from communities across the country, featuring the unsung heroes of the election process. Helping People Register Through the Voting Information Center So far 39 million people have visited the Voting Information Center on Facebook and Instagram to get information about how to register and how to vote from their state’s official website or one of our non-partisan partner sites. Now that registration deadlines are approaching, we’re including these deadlines so people have enough time to complete their registration applications. Next week, we’re launching the early voting feature with more information about early voting polling locations, dates, and hours. People can also learn about vote-by-mail options in their state, request a mail or absentee ballot if that’s available for them, and learn about upcoming deadlines so they have enough time to plan ahead. The Voting Information Center on Facebook is now available in Arabic, English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese and Mandarin to help US citizens register and vote in their native language. Getting Voter Registration Information via WhatsApp We’ve also worked to make helpful services available via messaging. WhatsApp has worked to bring the International Fact-Checking Network onto WhatsApp so people can get accurate information about voting issues in English and Spanish. In addition, Vote.org is now available on WhatsApp to provide people with information on how to register or request a mail ballot, and get help if they encounter a problem at the polls."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/keeping-facebook-groups-safe/","date":"2020-09-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Integrity & Security"],"title":"Our Latest Steps to Keep Facebook Groups Safe","text":"People turn to Facebook Groups to connect with others who share their interests, but even if they decide to make a group private, they have to play by the same rules as everyone else. Our Community Standards apply to public and private groups, and our proactive detection tools work across both. That means even if someone doesn’t report an issue to us, our AI can detect potentially violating content and we can remove it. Today we’re sharing an update on our ongoing work to keep groups safe, including a number of changes to reduce harmful content and misinformation. Over the last year, we removed about 1.5 million pieces of content in groups for violating our policies on organized hate, 91% of which we found proactively. We also removed about 12 million pieces of content in groups for violating our policies on hate speech, 87% of which we found proactively. That’s what we do for posts within groups. When it comes to groups themselves, we will take an entire group down if it repeatedly breaks our rules or if it was set up with the intent to violate our standards. Over the last year, we took down more than 1 million groups for violating these policies. Stopping People Who Break Our Rules We’re taking further steps to stop people who repeatedly violate our Community Standards from being able to create new groups. Our existing recidivism policy stops the admins of a group from creating another group similar to one we removed. Going forward, admins and moderators of groups taken down for policy violations will not be able to create any new groups for a period of time. For members who have any Community Standards violations in a group, their posts in that group will now require approval for the next 30 days. This stops their post from being seen by others until an admin or moderator approves it. If admins or moderators repeatedly approve posts that violate our Community Standards, we will remove the group. Helping Ensure Groups Have an Active Admin Admins are at the heart of fostering the purpose and culture of their groups. Sometimes admins may step down or leave their groups. Our proactive detection continues to operate in these groups, but we know that active admins can help maintain the community and promote more productive conversations. So we now suggest admin roles to members who may be interested. A number of factors go into these suggestions, including whether people have a history of Community Standards violations. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin archiving groups that have been without an admin for some time. Moving forward, when a single remaining admin chooses to step down, they can invite members to become admins. If no invited members accept, we will suggest admin roles to members who may be interested. If no one accepts, we’ll archive the group. Removing Health Groups from Recommendations Facebook Groups, including health groups, can be a positive space for giving and receiving support during difficult life circumstances. At the same time, it’s crucial that people get their health information from authoritative sources. To prioritize connecting people with accurate health information, we are starting to no longer show health groups in recommendations. People can still invite friends to health groups or search for them. For more information on the kinds of content we recommend, including groups, see our recommendations guidelines, which we recently made public. Continuing to Combat Organizations and Movements Tied to Violence This summer we continued to take action against groups tied to violence. We banned a violent US-based anti-government network connected to the boogaloo movement and removed 106 of their groups. We also expanded our policy to address organizations and movements that have demonstrated significant risks to public safety, including QAnon, US-based militia organizations and anarchist groups that support violent acts amid protests. We now limit the spread of these groups by removing them from recommendations, restricting them from search, and soon reducing their content in News Feed. We also remove these groups when they discuss potential violence, even if they use veiled language and symbols. For example, we removed 790 groups linked to QAnon under this policy. Combating Misinformation in Groups To combat misinformation across Facebook, we take a “remove, reduce, inform” approach that leverages a global network of independent fact-checkers. For Facebook Groups, this work includes: Removing groups that share content that violates our Community Standards. If admins or moderators repeatedly post or approve content that breaks our rules, we take down the whole group. Reducing the distribution of groups that share misinformation. Groups that repeatedly share content rated false by fact-checkers won’t be recommended to other people on Facebook. We rank all content from these groups lower in News Feed and limit notifications so fewer members see their posts. Informing people when they encounter misinformation. We apply a label to content that’s been reviewed by fact-checkers, so people can see additional context. We also notify people before they try to share this content, and we let people know if something they shared is later rated false. Group admins are also notified each time a piece of content rated false by fact-checkers is posted in their group, and they can see an overview of this in the Group Quality tool. We know there is more to do to keep groups safe on Facebook, and we’ll keep improving our technology and policies to ensure groups remain places where people can connect and find support."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/a-faster-and-easier-way-to-manage-your-business-on-facebook-and-instagram/","date":"2020-09-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Economic Opportunity","Facebook","Instagram","Meta"],"title":"A Faster and Easier Way to Manage Your Business on Facebook and Instagram","text":"With fewer customers walking into stores and restaurants during the pandemic, small businesses have had to find new ways to sell and reach customers online. Facebook’s free tools and personalized ads are a lifeline for many small businesses making this transition — and we’ve worked hard to create new products like Facebook Shops to make it easier for them to showcase their products and sell directly. Today we’re introducing Facebook Business Suite, a new interface to help businesses save time and stay up to date by managing their pages or profiles across our apps. It allows them to post to Facebook and Instagram at the same time, and manage and receive messages, notifications and alerts in one place. They can also easily see what’s working and learn what’s resonating with customers with Facebook and Instagram insights. Amanda Stefl is one of a number of small business owners around the world that has tested Facebook Business Suite. Amanda runs a Timber Hill Winery in Milton, Wisconsin, and a big part of her business is hosting events for wine lovers. So, when the pandemic hit, she had to get creative — using Facebook Live to run virtual events and Facebook and Instagram to communicate with customers remotely. Amanda told us: We’re building Facebook Business Suite for small businesses first, but this is a long-term investment to make this the main interface for businesses of all sizes who use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. It is available for small businesses globally starting today and will expand to larger businesses next year. After several tough months for small businesses around the world, we are also releasing two new surveys today that provide some good news. Our latest Global State of Small Business Report, produced monthly in partnership with the World Bank and OECD, found that small businesses making more than 25% of their sales online are more likely to report higher sales than this time last year and less likely to have reduced their number of employees. We are also publishing a study on the impact of COVID-19 on consumers’ purchasing patterns and their use of digital tools to search for and interact with businesses, in partnership with Deloitte. Nearly half of those surveyed said they had spent more money online overall since the outbreak, and 40% have increased their use of social media and online messaging for product and business recommendations. And of those who have swapped at least one of their usual businesses for a new one during the pandemic, nearly two-thirds said they used digital tools to discover that new business. The survey also found encouraging support for local businesses. Of those who said they had started shopping at new businesses, nearly three-quarters said that at least one was a small business. 31% also said they will increase their spending with small local businesses once the pandemic is over. The last few months have been tough for small businesses everywhere, and while there are reasons to be optimistic there is still much uncertainty ahead. But whatever happens, Facebook will continue to do all we can to help them adapt, survive and thrive online."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/celebrating-latinx-and-hispanic-heritage-month-across-our-apps/","date":"2020-09-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Boost with Facebook","Facebook","Instagram","Messenger","Meta"],"title":"Celebrating Latinx and Hispanic Heritage Month Across Our Apps","text":"Latinx and Hispanic Heritage Month is a time to celebrate the Latinx and Hispanic community, elevate diverse voices, provide support and share stories of resilience. That’s why we’re launching new features across our apps, providing resources and support for Latinx small business owners, adding new content on Facebook Watch that highlights voices of the Latinx community and more. New Product Features On Instagram, we’re adding new stickers, created by Latinx illustrators Camila Rosa, Dia Pacheco and Gabriela Alemán that celebrate the Latinx community. And when you use these stickers in a story, a green and yellow gradient will be added to the ring on your story. We’re also adding a new AR camera effect that will celebrate the diverse spectrum of Latinx heritage along with other themed effects. On Facebook, we’re adding Latinx and Hispanic Heritage Month-themed stickers created in partnership with artist Victor Melendez to use in stories and feed posts, as well as new expression assets for your Avatars. On Messenger we’re releasing a new 360 degree immersive background in honor of Latinx and Hispanic Heritage Month that will help bring virtual celebrations with friends and family to life, whether you’re on a Messenger video call or chatting with a group in Messenger Rooms. Resources for Latinx-Owned Small Businesses We are launching a Latinx Hispanic Business Boost, a free month-long program from Boost with Facebook to provide support and insights for Latinx-owned small businesses. We developed the content for this program in partnership with the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Latino Business Action Network, and it will include a mix of trainings, small business panels and external speaker sessions on topics like access to capital and content creation. Registration is now open. We’re also offering a Resource Guide with creative tips, success stories, training resources and more to help Latinx business owners grow their business. This is just one of the ways we’re supporting Latinx small businesses owners like Maria Jose Palacio, a fifth generation Colombian coffee farmer, and founder of Progeny Coffee, which has shifted its distribution strategy from supplying offices to consumer subscriptions to persevere through the COVID-19 pandemic. Or Paola Corzo, founder of La Escuelita, who has dedicated her tutoring service to serving low-income families in need and has moved her business online during COVID-19 to continue supporting students during this challenging time. La Escuelita Upcoming Programming We’re adding new content to Facebook Watch that elevates diverse voices and celebrates Latinx culture, from new original series, to music videos and more.

You can still connect with your college communities in Facebook Groups. Originally published on September 10, 2020 at 7:00AM PT: Today, we are launching Facebook Campus, a college-only space designed to help students connect with fellow classmates over shared interests. Facebook Campus makes it easy to find and start conversations within your college community. This year, students across the country are facing new challenges as some campuses shift to partial or full-time remote learning, so it’s more important than ever to find a way to stay connected to college life. College is a time for making new friends, finding people who share similar interests and discovering new opportunities to connect – from clubs to study groups, sports and more. In the early days, Facebook was a college-only network, and now we’re returning to our roots with Facebook Campus to help students make and maintain these relationships, even if they’re away from their college. How It Works Facebook Campus is a dedicated section of the Facebook app designed for students, with a Campus profile that’s different from their main Facebook profile. To create a Campus profile, all students need is their college email and graduation year. Other information such as their major, classes, hometown and minor are optional. Once a Campus profile is set up, students can discover Groups and Events unique to their school, and connect with classmates who share similar interests. When content is shared on Campus, only people within Campus will see it. Key Features Campus-only News Feed: Campus is a college email-verified space designed for students to get updates from classmates, groups and events in a college-specific feed. Students can create study groups, plan virtual concerts or ask for advice with college-only Groups and Events. Campus directory: College is about finding your people, so we created a classmates directory to make it easy to find and meet new people. Like in the early days when Facebook was a college-only network, students can find classmates by class, major, year and more. New ways to chat: Campus Chats are real-time chat rooms. Students can create chat rooms for their dorm, clubs or any other groups they’re part of within Campus. Availability We’re starting to roll out Facebook Campus to the following colleges in the US: Benedict College; Brown University; California Institute of Technology; College of William & Mary; Duke University; Florida International University; Georgia Southern University; Georgia State University; Johns Hopkins University; Lane College; Lincoln University (Pennsylvania); Middlebury College; New Jersey Institute of Technology; Northwestern University; Rice University; Sarah Lawrence College; Scripps College; Smith College; Spelman College; Stephen F Austin State University; Tufts University; University at Albany – State University of New York; University of Hartford; University of Louisville; University of Pennsylvania; University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire; Vassar College; Virginia Tech; Wellesley College; and Wesleyan University. Students at these colleges can find Campus within the Facebook app. Safety and Privacy We built Campus to be safe, inclusive and optional.

Originally published on September 10, 2020 at 7:00AM PT: Today we launched Facebook Campus, a space designed to help students connect with their classmates and college life, even if they’re not physically at school. In the early days, Facebook was a college-only network, and now we’re introducing Campus to make it easier for students to find classmates with similar interests in a dedicated section of Facebook. Who Sees My Information and Activity in Campus? People who sign up for Campus and are part of your college community will be able to see your Campus profile and the content you post in Campus. In order to gain access to Campus, people will have to input their school email address to verify their affiliation with the school. Your name, profile photo, cover photo and hometown from your Facebook profile will be added to your Campus profile, but you can edit or remove your hometown from your Campus profile if you’d like. Select college Pages have access to Campus. These college Pages can create, join and participate in Campus Groups and Events, but they do not have access to chats or the classmates directory. People who manage your college’s Page can also see your Campus profile if you and the Page both belong to the same Campus Group or Event. Campus does not have public Groups or public Events like Facebook does where content is visible to users on and off Facebook. Groups and Events in Campus are limited to your school so no one outside of your Campus can access or search for them. Campus Groups can either be open, which means anyone in your school’s Campus can see them, or they can be private, which means content in the Group is only visible to the members of that specific group. Similarly, Campus Events can be open, private or Group Events. Open Events are visible to anyone within your school’s Campus. Private Events are only visible to invited guests on Campus. And for Group Events, anyone who can see the Group can see the Event. You can use the Campus directory to find classmates who share your major, classes, graduation year and more based on their Campus profile information. You can block someone on Facebook or Campus and we won’t inform them. When someone you’ve blocked is logged into Facebook, they won’t be able to find you on Facebook or in the Campus directory. What Choices and Controls Do I Have? Campus is an opt-in experience within the Facebook app so you choose whether to join Campus and create a profile. Every Campus profile contains your name, cover photo and profile photo from your Facebook profile, as well as your graduation year. All other fields are optional and you can choose what you want to include. You can choose to delete your Campus profile through Campus settings at any time and your Campus profile will no longer appear in the classmates directory. You can also delete data such as comments in a group, posts, reactions, or an event in your Activity Log. The person who creates a Campus group chat can choose to remove the chat from Campus. For example, if someone sends an inappropriate message in a group chat, the chat admin can remove the entire chat thread. How Does Campus Impact Data Collection and the Ads I See? As with other Facebook products, we may use your activity from Facebook Campus to personalize your experience on our apps to show you more relevant content, including ads. This means your activity on Facebook may influence what you see in Campus, and your activity in Campus may influence what you see elsewhere on Facebook. Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your information from Campus and other Facebook products. You can access your Campus data in our Access Your Information and Download Your Information tools."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/the-evolution-of-facebook-watch/","date":"2020-09-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"The Evolution of Facebook Watch","text":"Since Facebook Watch launched globally in 2018, it’s become the go-to place to discover videos across Facebook for whatever you’re into — whether that’s live events, shows, sports, news or music videos. Today, more than 1.25 billion people visit Watch every month to discover and share videos from millions of creators and publishers. Instant Entertainment Personalized for You Our aim is to instantly entertain people when they visit Watch. We’ve made it easier for people to find more videos they’ll like with better navigation, expert curation and smarter machine learning. And we’re working on ways to connect people with videos that match their interests. During a time when people can’t come together physically, more people are turning to Watch to stay connected to creators, artists, sports, entertainment and what’s happening in the world. To support those connections, we introduced a dedicated section within Watch for live videos. Across Latin America, more than 13.7 million people tuned in to watch the UEFA Champions League final, making it the most-watched football broadcast on Facebook. Events like these are more than a stream of a game, they’re a way for fans to share in the moment by interacting in real time with the broadcaster and others. With growing demand to connect around music on Facebook, we introduced music videos in Watch to everyone in the US, India and Thailand. The music destination in Watch lets people explore music videos by genre, artist or mood, and features themed playlists. Last month, Katy Perry debuted her new music video, “Smile,” the title track of her just released fifth album, exclusively on Facebook to millions of fans. Shows in Watch continue to inspire conversation in Facebook Groups and beyond, with some fan-favorite series returning this month and new ones launching soon. Red Table Talk has emerged as the go-to place for unpacking today’s most compelling social issues in real time as Jada, Willow and Gammy have created a safe space for honest and vulnerable conversations. Mike Rowe spotlights the everyday heroes that go above and beyond for their local communities in the heartwarming Daytime Emmy-winning Returning the Favor. On STEVE on Watch, comedian Steve Harvey entertains audiences with his unique perspective, insight and celebrity interviews. And coming in October, Red Table Talk: The Estefans will bring together three generations of women — Gloria Estefan, her niece Lily and daughter Emily — around the iconic red table to share their opinions and life experiences, with no topics off-limits. Supporting Partners Through Economic Recovery The last few months have been tough for many creators and businesses. To help our partners, we are continuing to build new tools so they can diversify their revenue and expand their presence on Facebook. We recently launched paid online events to make it easy to create an online event, set a price, promote the event, collect payment and host the event, all in one place. To support small businesses and creators, Facebook will not collect any fees from paid online events for at least the next year. We’ve expanded availability of fan subscriptions and Stars so fans can support their favorite creators, and in-stream ads continue to evolve, making it easier to monetize more types of videos with ads. We are also in the early stages of rolling out a new Organic Video Post Testing tool to help partners A/B test aspects of a post, including thumbnails, titles, descriptions and video content so they can better determine what works best for their audience. Partner Success Stories Partners are using these tools to reach new audiences, showcase creative content and earn money. Buzzfeed, which runs Pages like Tasty, Goodful, Nifty, BringMe, Cocoa Butter and Pero Like, has seen an increase in revenue from Facebook by focusing on creating more videos over three minutes across their network of Pages. “We moved quickly and increased our payout from total in-stream ads by 20% compared to the previous half,” said Maycie Timpone, Executive Director, Video & Publishing at BuzzFeed. Brandi Guice, also known as Braannxo, is a beauty creator who shares makeup tutorials and beauty tips with her fans on Facebook. She uses Facebook Stars and fan subscriptions to deepen her bond with her community and promote real-time fan interaction, and these tools account for 98% of her revenue. UFC shares fight footage, highlights and interviews with athletes on Facebook Watch to build anticipation for its marquee events. It also uses in-stream ads to monetize its content, and currently generates more than seven figures annually in advertising revenue on Facebook. In France, national broadcaster M6 has seen a 2.5X increase in one-minute video views in nine months, while organically acquiring more than 6 million new follows across its network of Facebook Pages including France’s Got Talent, Top Chef and Les Marseillais. In Germany, ProSiebenSat.1 has more than doubled its one-minute video views in 11 months, while organically acquiring 2.5 million new follows across its show Pages such as The Voice of Germany and Galileo, rallying new audiences. In Thailand, leading TV broadcaster Channel 8 increased its monetizable one-minute video views for its drama series highlight videos by 6X. The broadcaster revamped its video editing and publishing strategy, implementing a new approach to grab viewers’ attention, increase monetizable views and improve in-stream ad payout while building brand awareness. Across Latin America, audiovisual production company Badabun has tripled its interactions on video content in the first half of 2020 and will continue to invest heavily in Spanish-language original series on Facebook Watch. We’re committed to making Watch a place that helps more than 1.25 billion people and millions of partners build connections through video."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/additional-steps-to-protect-the-us-elections/","date":"2020-09-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Election Integrity","Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta","Public Policy"],"title":"New Steps to Protect the US Elections","text":"Today, Mark Zuckerberg announced additional steps we’re taking to help secure the integrity of the US elections by encouraging voting, connecting people to authoritative information, and reducing the risks of post-election confusion.

Undoubtedly, connection, self-expression and the ability to build and be part of online communities remain the enduring virtues of social media. Platforms like Facebook have empowered many people who previously didn’t have the means to express themselves freely. This has played out in politics: political debate has erupted online. Facebook has become a stage for democratic debate – between citizens, between candidates and voters, and for campaigners and advocacy groups to make their arguments too. Much of that is positive – raucous, often intense, but undoubtedly now part of the fabric of an open democracy. That means Facebook and other social media companies have a big responsibility. Facebook constantly works to improve the way its services foster democratic participation – for example, this month we launched a new Voting Information Center as part of the biggest ever voter information campaign in the US, with the goal of registering 4 million voters. But it doesn’t mean – given how young this technology is – that we have fully researched all its effects yet. The US elections in 2016 exposed the risk of social media being abused to interfere in elections, and misinformation and political polarization clearly play out on social media platforms too. To continue to amplify all that is good for democracy on social media, and mitigate against that which is not, we need more objective, dispassionate, empirically grounded research. We need to better understand whether social media makes us more polarized as a society, or if it largely reflects the divisions that already exist; if it helps people to become better informed about politics, or less; or if it affects people’s attitudes towards government and democracy, including whether and how they vote. That’s why today we are announcing a new research partnership to better understand the impact of Facebook and Instagram on key political attitudes and behaviors during the US 2020 elections, building on the initiative we launched in 2018. It will examine the impact of how people interact with our products, including content shared in News Feed and across Instagram, and the role of features like content ranking systems. The effort is a partnership between Facebook researchers and independent external academics. Externally, the project is led by Professors Talia Stroud and Joshua A. Tucker, two independent academics who serve as chairs of Social Science One committees. Professors Tucker and Stroud selected 15 additional researchers to collaborate on this effort, based on their expertise. Three principles guide our work, and will continue to do so as we move ahead: independence, transparency and consent. Independence: The external researchers won’t be paid by Facebook and they won’t answer to Facebook either. Neither the questions they’ve asked nor the conclusions they draw will be restricted by Facebook. We’ve signed the same contracts with them that we do with other independent researchers who use our data (which is publicly posted on Social Science One’s web site). Transparency: The researchers have committed to publish their findings in academic journals in open access format, which means they will be freely available to the public. Facebook and the researchers will also document study plans and hypotheses in advance through a pre-registration process and release those initial commitments upon publication of the studies. This means that people will be able to check that we did what we said we would – and didn’t hide any of the results. In addition, to run their own analyses and further check our homework, we plan to deliver de-identified data on the studies we run. We have also invited Michael Wagner, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, to document and publicly comment on our research process as an independent observer. Consent: We are asking for the explicit, informed consent from those who opt to be part of research that analyzes individual level data. This means research participants will confirm both the use of their data and that they understand how and why their data will be used. Additionally, as part of our studies, we will also analyze aggregated user data on Facebook and Instagram to help us understand patterns. In addition to this, the studies – and our consent language – were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure they adhere to high ethical standards. This research is part of Facebook’s wider effort to protect elections. As a company, we’ve looked hard at what went wrong with Russian interference in 2016 and made some big changes. There are now three times as many people working on safety and security issues, more than 35,000 in total, and we work closely with government and law enforcement. Facebook has helped fight interference in more than 200 elections since 2017 and reduced fake news on its platform by more than 50%, according to independent studies. This research won’t settle every debate about social media and democracy, but we hope and expect the researchers will advance society’s understanding of the intersection of technology and democracy. The answers will help us all to shape the rules of the road for the internet – for the benefit of our democracy, and society as a whole. For more information, please see below for an FAQ, or read this announcement from the lead researchers. FAQ Q: Who are the independent researchers and how were they chosen? A: Facebook is working with a group of 17 independent researchers who are experts in the fields of elections, democracy and social media. Social Science One facilitated the start of the project, and two of its committee chairs, Talia Stroud and Joshua A. Tucker, serve as co-chairs of this project. They selected researchers who represent a variety of institutions, disciplines, areas of expertise and methodological traditions. Facebook did not select the researchers and is taking measures to ensure that they operate independently. They are: Hunt Allcott, New York University Deen Freelon, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Matthew Gentzkow, Independent Researcher Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon, University of Pennsylvania Andrew Guess, Princeton University Shanto Iyengar, Independent Researcher Young Mie Kim, University of Wisconsin-Madison David Lazer, Northeastern University Neil Malhotra, Independent Researcher Brendan Nyhan, Dartmouth College Jennifer Pan, Independent Researcher Jaime Settle, William & Mary Talia Stroud, The University of Texas at Austin Emily Thorson, Syracuse University Rebekah Tromble, The George Washington University Joshua A. Tucker, New York University Magdalena Wojcieszak, University of California, Davis; University of Amsterdam Q: What measures will you take to ensure this research is independent, ethical and well done? A: No financial incentives: While Facebook will continue to pay its employees who work on this research, we will not be compensating our external research partners. Pre-registration: Facebook and the researchers will pre-register our research together. This means we will document and publish under embargo the hypotheses we plan to investigate prior to beginning our studies, using pre-analysis plans. These plans will become public upon publication of the results. As such, when the studies are published, everyone can be clear that we are reporting all of the results, not just a small selection. No pre-publication approval: Regardless of what is discovered, Facebook will not restrict the researchers from publishing their findings. As with other Social Science One research, Facebook is entitled to review (not approve or reject) research prior to publication, and remove any confidential or personally identifiable information. (Our operating contract is public, and can be viewed at Social Science One’s web site.) External Institutional Review Board (IRB) ethics process: The studies that Facebook and the independent researchers conduct were submitted to and approved by an IRB. Incorporating both consent and privacy in the research design: The research design is built with consent and privacy in mind. For example, our design includes obtaining explicit, informed consent from research participants for analyses of individual level data. Additionally, as part of our studies, we will analyze aggregated user data on Facebook and Instagram to help us understand patterns. We’ll also implement privacy and security practices in the storage and processing of the data such as data access controls and isolated, privacy-protective storage of the data. Enabling replication: Facebook plans on partnering with the external research team to deliver de-identified data on all the studies we run. This means that other researchers will be able to, in effect, check our homework by re-running analyses on data that cannot be reasonably linked to an individual. Independent Observer: We invited Michael Wagner, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, to document and publicly comment on our research process as an independent observer. We have asked him to publish, once the project is complete, on how the process of the research proceeded, in order to validate the above mechanisms, and thus the independence and credibility of the effort. Q: What methodologies will the researchers use? A: The independent academics are collaborating with Facebook researchers to design a diverse set of studies to analyze the role of Facebook and Instagram in the US 2020 election. To collect the information for the study, we are partnering with NORC at the University of Chicago, an objective, non-partisan research institution that has been studying public opinion since 1941. NORC possesses deep expertise in survey research, policy evaluation, data collection, advanced analytics and data science. The study was approved by NORC’s Institutional Review Board. For people who have explicitly opted in to the study, we plan to combine multiple research methods, including surveys and behavioral data analysis, along with targeted changes to some participants’ experiences with Facebook and Instagram. For example, participants could see more or fewer ads in specific categories such as retail, entertainment or politics, or see more or fewer posts in News Feed related to specific topics. Other participants may be asked to stop using Facebook or Instagram for a period of time. A subset of participants may be asked to install an app on their devices – with their permission – that will log other digital media that they consume. This will allow researchers to understand more comprehensively the information environment that people experience. Q: Will Facebook make changes to its products as a result of the study? A: We are continually making changes and improvements to our products, and this research, along with other continuous input we receive from external stakeholders, will be considered in this process. Q: Is it likely that this research will change the outcome of an election? A: No. With billions of dollars spent on ads, direct mail, canvassing, organizing and get out the vote efforts, it is statistically implausible that one research initiative could impact the outcome of an election. The research has been carefully designed to not impact the outcome of the election or harm participants. The sample of participants represents approximately 0.1% of the entire US eligible voting population spread across the US. By better understanding how people use our platform during an election, we can continually enhance the integrity of the platform moving forward. Q: How will you monitor the effects of the research? A: Facebook and our research partners will be monitoring the research at every step. In the highly unlikely event they detect unanticipated effects, they will stop the research and take corrective action as needed. Q: How are you ensuring this work will be done in a way that safeguards people’s privacy? A: The research design is built with consent and privacy in mind. For example, our design includes obtaining explicit, informed consent from research participants. Additionally, as part of our studies and consistent with our Data Policy, we will also analyze aggregated data on US based Facebook and Instagram users to help us understand patterns. We’ll also implement privacy and security practices in the storage and processing of the data such as data access controls. Q: When will the study start and end? A: The study started in August 2020 and we extended the data collection to include the full election cycle through February 2021. (Updated on June 8, 2021 at 8:20AM PT to reflect the study’s extended timeframe.) Q: How do people opt into the study? A: Representative, scientific samples of people in the US will be selected and invited to participate in the study. Some potential participants will see a notice in Facebook or Instagram inviting them to take part in the study. Study samples will be designed to ensure that participants mirror the diversity of the US adult population, as well as users of Facebook and Instagram. Q: How many people will participate in the study? A: We expect between 200,000 and 400,000 US adults may choose to participate in the study, which could include things like taking part in surveys or agreeing to see a different product experience. We will also study trends across Facebook and Instagram – but only in aggregate. Q: How are you ensuring that this research is ethically sound? A: As part of the research design, studies that Facebook and the independent researchers conduct underwent IRB review. The research team also received ethical guidance from the independent firm Ethical Resolve to inform study designs. Q: Will research participants’ data be used to target ads? A: None of the survey data collected for this research effort from consented research participants will be used for ads targeting. Q: Is Facebook paying the researchers? How much are you investing in this project? A: Facebook is investing significant resources in this effort. However, as part of our efforts to ensure the independence of the external research team, we will not pay them. Q: When will the results be published? A: We expect initial papers to be available in mid-2021 at the earliest, and hope that many of them will be published shortly thereafter. Q: Does Facebook have veto-power over publishing the results? A: No. Q: Will voter files be used as part of this research? A: This research seeks to better understand the relationship between someone’s social media use and their likelihood of voting. At no point will Facebook be in possession of any voter files. Instead, our survey partner, NORC at the University of Chicago, will work with two independent companies to match select voter file information, such as voter registration and voter turnout. This information will only be collected from those who have given their consent to be a part of the study and only in states where its use is legally permitted. It will be used for research purposes only. (Updated on August 3, 2021 at 12:48PM PT to further clarify what information will be used for this research.)"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/recommendation-guidelines/","date":"2020-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Instagram","Integrity & Security","Meta","Public Policy"],"title":"Recommendation Guidelines","text":"Across our apps, we make recommendations to help you discover new communities and content we think you’re likely to be interested in.

Originally published on August 25, 2020 at 8:00AM PT: Today we’re introducing Facebook Shop, a new place to discover businesses and shop for products in the Facebook app, and we’re expanding checkout on Instagram to all US businesses and creators. We’re also making Shops available to any eligible business and adding customization features, messaging and new insights. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to online shopping has rapidly accelerated, with an estimated 85% of people worldwide now shopping online. We want to make shopping easier for people and empower anyone, from an entrepreneur to the largest brand, to use our apps to connect with customers and grow their business. That’s why we’re creating new ways for people to shop on our apps and providing tools to help businesses sell online. A New Place for People to Shop in the Facebook App Today we’re introducing Facebook Shop, a new place to discover businesses and shop for products in the Facebook app. Facebook Shop makes it easy for people to find products from businesses they love, discover new ones and make purchases, all in one place. We just started testing this in the US and we launched a complementary shopping destination on Instagram in July, called Instagram Shop, where people can discover and buy products from creators and brands, all in one place. New Tools for Businesses to Create and Manage an Online Store One of the easiest ways for businesses to showcase their products on Facebook and Instagram is through Facebook Shops. Shops makes it simple for businesses to set up a single online store that customers can access on both Facebook and Instagram. We launched Shops in May, and in the coming weeks, we’re making it available to any eligible business and adding customization features, messaging and new insights to help businesses measure results. We’re also expanding checkout on Instagram to all US businesses and creators. These new features give businesses more control over how their digital storefront looks and make creating new collections easier. These include: New design layouts for featuring single products or groups of products in Shops Real-time preview of collections as they are designed The ability to automatically create Shops for new sellers New insights to measure results in Commerce Manager Expanding Checkout on Instagram In the coming weeks, all eligible sellers in the US will be able to start using checkout on Instagram. Checkout makes it easy for people to make a purchase in just a few taps, without leaving the app. To use checkout, businesses must have Shops and use Facebook Commerce Manager or our partners Shopify and BigCommerce. We’ll support more platform partners soon. We’re also waiving selling fees for businesses through the end of the year to reduce the cost of doing business online, especially given the current economic crisis. Connect with Customers Using Messaging and Live Shopping Messaging through Shops combines the in-store experience of being able to ask a salesperson questions with the convenience of online shopping. Messaging allows businesses to provide personalized assistance so people can make more informed decisions about their purchase. The new messaging button on Shops makes it easy for people to message businesses through Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram Direct. Customers can view products right within the chat, making it easy to share products with friends and family to get feedback before making a purchase. We’re testing this feature on Messenger and Instagram Direct now, and will start testing it on WhatsApp soon. With Live Shopping, we’re making it easier for people to shop in real time. We’ve been testing this feature on both Facebook and Instagram, and now Facebook Live Shopping includes new features to help businesses easily set up a live experience featuring products from their Shop and sell directly from the video. Instagram Live Shopping is now available to all businesses and creators using checkout in the US. @media screen and (min-width: 960px) { .single .fb_iframe_widget_fluid_desktop.verticalvid span { width: 285px !important; }}"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/bringing-facebook-news-to-more-countries/","date":"2020-08-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Bringing Facebook News to More Countries","text":"Update on March 1, 2021 at 4:00AM PT: After expanding to the UK in January 2021, Facebook News will launch in Germany in May 2021. Today we announced early partnerships with publishers that represent more than 100 editorial brands in Germany. For more information, check out the Facebook Journalism Project post. Originally published on August 25, 2020 at 6:30AM PT: The US launch of Facebook News marked a new chapter in our relationship with the news industry and it’s off to a strong start. Built with publisher feedback and insights from people, it is a personalized destination for news within Facebook. Helping publishers reach new audiences has been one of our most important goals, and we’ve found over 95% of the traffic Facebook News delivers to publishers is incremental to the traffic they already get from News Feed. Based on this progress, we are accelerating our plans to expand internationally. We aim to launch Facebook News in multiple countries within the next six months to a year and are considering the UK, Germany, France, India and Brazil. In each country, we’ll pay news publishers to ensure their content is available in the new product. Consumer habits and news inventory vary by country, so we’ll work closely with news partners in each country to tailor the experience and test ways to deliver a valuable experience for people while also honoring publishers’ business models. We will continue to focus on growing engagement of Facebook News in the US and we’re committed to the partnerships we’ve developed with US publishers to make Facebook News a valuable asset over the long term. Innovation is critical to building a sustainable news ecosystem.

In March, we launched a $100 million global grant program to help businesses keep the lights on – and we earmarked 50% of the grants in the US ($20 million) for minority, women and veteran-owned businesses. Black-owned businesses have faced systemic barriers for generations – and the huge amount of interest we received from these businesses confirmed just how enormous the challenges they continue to face really are. That is why we doubled down on investing in and building tools to help this community – and today I am excited to share an update on our efforts. Grants to Support the Black Community Earlier this summer, we committed an additional $100 million investment to support Black-owned businesses, creators and nonprofits in the US. Of that, we’re allocating $40 million in grants to support 10,000 Black-owned businesses in the US. Starting today, any majority Black-owned business with 50 or fewer employees can apply for a grant. We know every day counts, so we’re partnering with Accenture and the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) to get these grants to Black-owned businesses quickly. Businesses can visit facebook.com/BlackBusinessGrants for more details about the program and how to apply. We also opened grant applications for Black creators a few weeks ago – dedicating $25 million to support the next generation of Black voices on Facebook and Instagram in the US. The program will provide them with access to funding, education, development resources and local activities to help them grow their community and establish a business across our apps. Creators who are interested can apply at facebook.com/creators/bcp#apply. We will continue to share updates on our diverse investments – with the remaining $30+ million going to nonprofits that serve the Black community in the US. Discover Black-Owned Businesses While capital is important, so are in-product updates. Black entrepreneurs, small businesses and local shops can now get discovered in a privacy-protected way on Facebook. We’re making it possible for people to identify their Page as a Black or minority-owned business on Facebook, so anyone who wants to support them can do so easily. Diverse business categories will be associated with business Pages, not people. The best way to find Black-owned businesses is in the Businesses Nearby tool, where you can browse offerings and click through to message them directly. Self-designation is completely voluntary – Page admins can choose to skip, edit or remove diverse-owned business information at any time. The path to recovery is challenging but we’re determined to do all we can to help small businesses weather the storm.

When we introduce revenue share in 2023, it will be less than the 30% that Apple and others typically take. Although Facebook is collecting no fees today, creators still can have a hard time calculating their final earnings, so we will introduce a new payout interface to help them understand their payouts. Starting with paid online events, creators will see what their payouts will be after taxes, refunds, and mobile platform fees from purchases made on iOS and Android devices where applicable. Left: Payout interface for paid online events — current state showing no fees. Right: Payout interface for paid online events — future state when other companies’ fees are introduced. Update on December 30, 2020 at 2:05 PM PT: Apple extended the time period during which it will not enforce its in-app purchase rules to June 30, 2021, enabling Facebook to choose which payment platform to use for paid online event purchases made on Apple mobile devices until then. We will continue using Facebook Pay so that businesses and creators can keep all their paid online event earnings (minus applicable taxes) during this challenging time. Unfortunately, Apple continues to exclude gaming creators from this exemption. We hope Apple will consider permanently changing its requirement for apps to use its payment processing platform as well as reduce the associated 30% tax. Such a high tax places a disproportionate and unnecessary financial burden on small businesses, particularly those that rely on other platforms, such as Facebook, to connect with their audience because they lack the resources to develop their own app. Update on September 25, 2020 at 9:00 AM PT: Businesses will be able to keep all of their paid online event earnings (minus applicable taxes) from now until December 31. Facebook Pay will process all paid online events purchases, meaning that businesses and creators will not pay the 30% Apple App Store tax for the remaining three months of 2020. All businesses are eligible except gaming creators. Facebook will not collect any fees from paid online events while businesses remain closed for the pandemic, until at least August 2021. Originally published on August 14, 2020 at 12:15 PM PT: Today we’re launching the ability for businesses, creators, educators and media publishers to earn money from online events on Facebook. Now Page owners can create an online event, set a price, promote the event, collect payment and host the event, all in one place. With social distancing mandates still in place, many businesses and creators are bringing their events and services online to connect with existing customers and reach new ones. People are also relying on live video and interactive experiences more when they can’t come together physically. In June, we saw live broadcasts from Pages double compared to the same time last year, largely attributed to broadcasts since March. By combining marketing, payment and live video, paid online events meet the end-to-end needs of businesses. Pages can host events on Facebook Live to reach broad audiences, and we’re testing paid events with Messenger Rooms for more personal and interactive gatherings. In testing, we’ve seen businesses use Facebook to host expert talks, trivia events, podcast recordings, boxing matches, cooking classes, intimate meet-and-greets, fitness classes and more. Now, Pages in 20 countries around the world that meet our partner monetization policies can start charging for online events, making it easier for millions of people and small businesses to make money on Facebook. Check here to see if you qualify and get access. Waiving Fees on Paid Online Events to Support Businesses and Creators In our most recent State of Small Business Report with OECD and World Bank, we found that access to cash continues to be the most common ongoing challenge for SMBs. Only 19% of surveyed businesses were getting any financial help (down from earlier in pandemic). Many businesses are struggling and every cent matters. Shifting in-person events to online is costly enough that businesses shouldn’t have to worry about fees charged by platforms. To support small businesses and creators, Facebook will not collect any fees from paid online events for at least the next year. For transactions on the web, and on Android in countries where we have rolled out Facebook Pay, small businesses will keep 100% of the revenue they generate from paid online events. We asked Apple to reduce its 30% App Store tax or allow us to offer Facebook Pay so we could absorb all costs for businesses struggling during COVID-19. Unfortunately, they dismissed both our requests and SMBs will only be paid 70% of their hard-earned revenue. While Facebook is waiving fees for paid online events we will make other fees clear in the product. (Updated on August 14, 2020 at 1:07 PM PT to clarify where we will explain the fees.) Here’s how this will look on Android and iOS, which we submitted to Apple today for approval. Payment flow on iOS (left) and Android (right) We remain committed to supporting SMBs, and we’ll keep finding ways to make it easier for them to bring their businesses online. You can see more resources to help Pages create paid online events, including a set of best practices and online lessons for businesses and creators to help them get started.

Starting this weekend, you’ll be able to discover, watch and share music videos from today’s top artists to up-and-coming bands and classics across various music genres on Facebook. In the coming weeks, we’re excited for global music video premieres happening on Facebook, including exclusive music video content from J. Balvin, Karol G, Sebastian Yatra, Alejandro Fernandez and Calibre 50. Fans can also expect the premiere of the official music video for a new track from Lele Pons on Facebook first, who will be going live in advance to connect with fans and build excitement. In addition, Panamanian R&B singer Sech will be exclusively releasing a new video on Facebook and engaging fans in the leadup through tools like Live, countdown stickers in Stories and fan Groups. With official music videos on Facebook, we’re creating new social experiences that are about more than just watching the video. We’ve been working with partners in India and Thailand to build the foundation of a music video experience on Facebook. Now we’re excited to launch in the US in partnership with Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Merlin, BMG, Kobalt and many others across the independent music community, publishers and societies. Discovering and Sharing Music Videos on Facebook We know music is personal, so we’ve made it easy to share and discover music videos that matter to you and your friends. Like any video on Facebook, you can react to, comment on and share music videos that are important to you or reflect your current mood across News Feed, Groups and Messenger. You can also discover new artists from music videos shared by friends in News Feed, connect with fans who share your passion in a Facebook Group dedicated to your favorite artist, and react to a video in real time as it premieres. We’re also launching a new destination for Music in Facebook Watch where you can explore music videos by genre, artist or mood, as well as themed playlists like “Hip Hop MVPs,” “Trailblazers of Pop” and “Epic Dance Videos.” You’ll also find timely playlists like “Popular This Week” and “New This Week.” Over time, the experience will become more personalized to your tastes based on artists you follow and videos you engage with. The Music destination in Facebook Watch will be available on desktop and iOS and Android mobile devices starting tomorrow. Connecting Artists and Fans Artists already use our apps to get closer to fans through sharing everyday moments in Stories, promoting new releases with custom AR effects and Music Stickers, hosting Q&As on Facebook Live, and raising money for important causes through the donate button in Live and Stories. Now, artists will have the opportunity to connect with fans around their official music videos on Facebook, too. You can also follow your favorite artists to stay up to date and see their latest music videos and posts in your News Feed. You can follow an artist directly from a music video, and click through from a video to their Page to learn more about them and find information like when they’re performing next and where to buy their music. We’ve also made updates to Artist Pages so you can find and browse the official music videos of artists you love. Looking Ahead We’ll continue working with our music partners to build unique social experiences and bring music into the ways people connect and share. In the coming weeks, we’ll add more of your favorite music videos to Facebook. And over time, we’ll introduce more features to help music lovers share, discover and connect around music on Facebook."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/07/go-live-on-facebook-from-messenger-rooms/","date":"2020-07-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Messenger","Meta","Product News"],"title":"Go Live on Facebook From Messenger Rooms","text":"Today, we’re introducing a new way to broadcast live to Facebook from Messenger Rooms. Turning your room into a Facebook Live broadcast makes it easy to go live with up to 50 people. Whether you’re hosting a book club with friends, interviewing a panel of experts, teaching a fitness class, or broadcasting with your friends for fun, going live from a room lets you interact with audiences of any size. From Rooms to Live People are turning to Facebook Live more than ever to stay connected. Live broadcasts from Pages doubled in June 2020 compared to the same time last year, largely attributed to broadcasts since March 2020. From artists raising money for efforts they care about and local zoos hosting daily safari adventures, to congregations coming together for worship and couples exchanging vows, people are finding creative ways to connect through Facebook Live. Messenger Rooms are joinable group video calls that make it easy to spend quality time with friends, loved ones and people who share your interests. Create a room that can go live right from Facebook or Messenger web, and invite anyone to join, even if they don’t have a Facebook account. As a room creator, you can broadcast your room to a Profile, Page or Group, and invite people to tune in. By bringing Messenger Rooms and Facebook Live together, we’re unlocking new ways for people to connect and create content even while they’re apart. The room creator controls the live broadcast, including where the room is shared on Facebook, who can view the broadcast and who’s invited to participate. All the room participants will receive a notification inviting them to join the live broadcast and will have to opt in to participate. They can also choose to leave the room before it goes live. The room creator can add or remove participants from the live broadcast at any time and room participants can leave the live broadcast at any time. Room creators can also lock and unlock a room during the live broadcast. Keeping People Safe When a room creator chooses to go Live, the broadcast is shared to Facebook and people outside the room may see what’s happening in the room based on the audience and where the room is shared on Facebook. We encourage viewers to report any live video that they believe violates our Community Standards. As with other Live videos on Facebook, we may collect and review audio and video from the broadcast to make sure it follows our Community Standards. Looking Ahead This feature is rolling out in some countries on Facebook and Messenger web starting today, and will soon expand to all countries where Messenger Rooms is available as well as to the Facebook and Messenger mobile app and Messenger desktop app. And we’ll continue to add enhancements over the coming months.

We’re removing this signal because it did not have a significant effect on the news ecosystem. We’ll continue our efforts to boost quality news by improving more impactful signals. You can read more about our approach to news here. Update on January 12, 2021 at 10:00AM PT: News articles that do not contain new original reporting or analysis will now receive less distribution in News Feed. The more extensive original reporting an article contains, the more distribution it will receive in News Feed. Original reporting includes things like exclusive source materials, significant analysis, new interviews or the creation of original visuals. These updates will apply to news stories published in English to start. Update on November 21, 2020 at 10:15AM PT: To help you discover credible and informative news, we are now prioritizing original reporting and transparent authorship in the news content we suggest to you in News Feed. Our Recommendation Guidelines further explain what content is eligible to appear in recommendations. Originally published on June 30, 2020 at 7:00AM PT: When we ask people what kind of news they want to see on Facebook, they continually tell us they want news stories that are credible and informative. Today, we’re updating the way news stories are ranked in News Feed to prioritize original reporting and stories with transparent authorship. These signals are based on user research and were built with feedback from news publishers and academic experts. They will only apply to news content. Original News Content Original reporting plays an important role in informing people around the world, from breaking a news story, to creating an in-depth investigative report, uncovering new facts and data, sharing critical updates in times of crisis, or broadcasting eyewitness reports. This important journalism takes time and expertise, and we want to ensure that it’s prioritized on Facebook. We will now prioritize articles in News Feed that we identify as original reporting on a developing story or topic. We do this by looking at groups of articles on a particular story topic and identifying the ones most often cited as the original source. We’ll start by identifying original reporting in English language news and will do the same for news in other languages in the future. Most of the news stories people see in News Feed are from sources they or their friends follow, and that won’t change. When multiple stories are shared by publishers and are available in a person’s News Feed, we will boost the more original one which will help it get more distribution. Defining original reporting and the standards for it are complex, so we will continue to work with publishers and academics to refine this approach over time. Transparent Authorship We are also starting to demote news content that does not have transparent information about the publisher’s editorial staff. We will review news articles for bylines or a staff page on the publisher’s website that lists the first and last names of reporters or other editorial staff. We’ve found that publishers who do not include this information often lack credibility to readers and produce content with clickbait or ad farms, all content people tell us they don’t want to see on Facebook. Editorial transparency is a professional standard supported by organizations like the Trust Project, SOS Support Public Broadcasting Coalition, Global Forum for Media Development, and Reporters Without Borders’ Journalism Trust Initiative. We consulted with these organizations, in addition to more than 20 other global media experts, to develop these standards. We recognize that in some areas, transparency can put journalists at risk so we are only doing this in limited markets to start, taking into account the press environment in which publishers operate. How Will These Changes Impact Publishers’ Content? Original news and reporting may see an increase in distribution as a result of these changes, but it’s important to remember that News Feed uses a variety of ranking signals to prioritize content. You can learn more about how we rank publisher content in News Feed here. We anticipate most news publishers won’t see significant changes to their distribution in News Feed as a result of these updates."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/more-context-for-news-articles-and-other-content/","date":"2020-06-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Providing People With Additional Context About Content They Share","text":"Update on August 12, 2020 at 6:00AM PT: Giving People More Context About COVID-19 Links We want to make sure people have the context they need to make informed decisions about what to share on Facebook, especially when it comes to COVID-19 content. So today, we’re starting to roll out a global notification screen to give people more context about COVID-19 related links when they are about to share them. The notification will help people understand the recency and source of the content before they share it. It will also direct people to our COVID-19 Information Center to ensure people have access to credible information about COVID-19 from global health authorities. Along those lines, we want to ensure we don’t slow the spread of information from credible health authorities, so content posted by government health authorities and recognized global health organizations, like the World Health Organization, will not have this notification. Originally published on June 25, 2020 at 8:00AM PT: When we ask people what kind of news they want to see on Facebook, they continually tell us they want information that is timely and credible. That’s why in 2018, we added the context button, which provides information about the sources of articles in News Feed. Today, we’re starting to globally roll out a notification screen that will let people know when news articles they are about to share are more than 90 days old. To ensure people have the context they need to make informed decisions about what to share on Facebook, the notification screen will appear when people click the share button on articles older than 90 days, but will allow people to continue sharing if they decide an article is still relevant. Over the past several months, our internal research found that the timeliness of an article is an important piece of context that helps people decide what to read, trust and share. News publishers in particular have expressed concerns about older stories being shared on social media as current news, which can misconstrue the state of current events. Some news publishers have already taken steps to address this on their own websites by prominently labeling older articles to prevent outdated news from being used in misleading ways. .fb_iframe_widget { display: block; } .fb_iframe_widget_fluid_desktop, .fb_iframe_widget_fluid_desktop span, .fb_iframe_widget_fluid_desktop iframe { max-width: 414px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } Over the next few months, we will also test other uses of notification screens.

As a result, Zaghar and anyone acting on his behalf are permanently banned from using Facebook or Instagram. The injunction is part of a settlement agreement between Facebook and Zaghar, under which Zaghar was required to provide information about his scraping activities such as his code and infrastructure details. In addition, Zaghar also provided proof that he had deleted the data obtained from scraping. These outcomes further demonstrate that this behavior is unacceptable and will result in serious consequences for those who abuse our services. Update on August 12, 2020 at 11:50AM PT: Last week, the Commercial Court in Madrid, Spain, granted Facebook Inc. and Facebook Ireland’s request for a court order directing MGP25 Cyberint Services and its founder to cease their fake engagement operations immediately. The Court found that Facebook demonstrated the defendants had violated Instagram’s Terms of Use and Spanish law by operating a service designed to automate various activities on Instagram, including the creation of accounts and posting of likes, comments and other fake engagement. The Court’s decision confirms that this conduct is a violation of our Terms and is an important milestone in our global legal enforcement against fake engagement and the use of automation on Instagram. We will continue to pursue these cases to protect people and our platform from those who engage in abuse and disregard our cease and desist letters. Originally published on June 18, 2020 at 8:00AM PT: Today we filed separate lawsuits in Europe and the United States to enforce our Terms of Service against the use of unauthorized automation software on Facebook and Instagram. This is one of the first times a social media company is using coordinated, multi-jurisdictional litigation to enforce its Terms and protect its users. The defendants in the European lawsuit operated a Spain-based fake engagement service, and the defendant in the US lawsuit operated a data scraping service with ties to California. These lawsuits also allege the defendants violated the laws of Spain and the US, including Spain’s protections for databases and online platforms and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US. We are seeking injunctions to reinforce our permanent ban against their use of our platform. Facebook Inc. and Facebook Ireland sued MGP25 Cyberint Services and its founder in the commercial court of Madrid for providing automation software to distribute fake likes and comments on Instagram. The defendant’s service was designed to evade Instagram’s restrictions against fake engagement by mimicking the official Instagram app in the way that it connected to our systems. The defendants did this for profit, and continued to do so even after we sent a Cease and Desist letter and disabled their accounts. Facebook Inc. also sued Mohammad Zaghar in federal court in San Francisco for operating a data scraping service called Massroot8. This service asked people to provide their Facebook login credentials on the Massroot8 website. The credentials were then used by Zaghar’s service to scrape user data from Facebook. Zaghar collected the data by using a computer program to control a network of bots, which pretended to be an Android device connected to the official Facebook mobile app. The defendant engaged in this abuse even after Facebook sent a Cease and Desist letter and disabled his accounts. Today’s legal actions demonstrate our commitment to enforcing our policies and holding people accountable for abusing our services."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/labeling-state-controlled-media/","date":"2020-06-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Election Integrity","Facebook","Integrity & Security","Product News","Public Policy"],"title":"Labeling State-Controlled Media On Facebook","text":"Update on May 17, 2021 at 10:00AM PT: Starting today, people outside the US will begin to see these labels on additional content including ads in feed on Facebook and Instagram. Update on September 29, 2020 at 12:00PM PT: Starting today, we’re adding these labels on Instagram to posts and profiles. We will roll this out to ads in the months to come. Update on August 31, 2020 at 12:00PM PT: Starting today, we’re adding these labels on Instagram in the About this Account section, and we’ll show them on posts, profiles and ads in the months to come. Update on June 17, 2020 at 8:00AM PT: Today we will begin to block ads from state-controlled media outlets targeted to people in the US. Originally published on June 4, 2020 at 9:00AM PT: We want to help people better understand who’s behind the news they see on Facebook. Several months ago, we announced our plan to label media outlets that are wholly or partially under the editorial control of their government, and today we’re starting to apply labels to those state-controlled media outlets. We’re providing greater transparency into these publishers because they combine the influence of a media organization with the strategic backing of a state, and we believe people should know if the news they read is coming from a publication that may be under the influence of a government. And to ensure we’re equally transparent when it comes to paid content from these publishers, we will begin labeling ads from these publishers later this year. State-controlled media outlets rarely advertise in the US. Nevertheless, later this summer we will begin blocking ads from these outlets in the US out of an abundance of caution to provide an extra layer of protection against various types of foreign influence in the public debate ahead of the November 2020 election in the US. Where the Labels Will Be Shown The labels will appear globally in the Ad Library Page view, on Pages, and in the Page Transparency section. In the US, the label will also start to appear on posts in News Feed over the course of the next week. Later this summer, we’ll apply the label to ads from state-controlled media outlets, starting with a few outlets and adding more over time. Our Policy Criteria To inform our policy criteria, we consulted more than 65 experts around the world specializing in media, governance, and human rights and development. The input we received from these organizations was crucial to understanding the different ways and degrees to which governments exert editorial control over media entities. We know that governments continue to use funding mechanisms to control media, but this alone doesn’t tell the full story. That’s why our definition of state-controlled media extends beyond just assessing financial control or ownership and includes an assessment of editorial control exerted by a government. Based on these consultations and research, we developed our own policy criteria to determine whether a publisher is wholly or partially under the editorial control of a government. We look at several factors that may indicate editorial control by a government, including: Mission statement, mandate, and/or public reporting on how the organization defines and accomplishes its journalistic mission Ownership structure such as information on owners, stakeholders, board members, management, government appointees in leadership positions, and disclosure of direct or indirect ownership by entities or individuals holding elected office Editorial guidelines such as transparency around sources of content and independence and diversity of sources Information about newsroom leadership and staff Sources of funding and revenue Governance and accountability mechanisms such as correctional policies, procedure for complaints, external assessments and oversight boards If we determine that there are enough protections in place to ensure editorial independence, we will not apply the label. Publishers looking to prove their independence must be able to demonstrate at least: A statute in the host country that clearly protects the editorial independence of the organization Established procedures, processes, and protections at the media organization to ensure editorial independence An assessment by an independent, credible, external organization finding that the statute has in fact been complied with and established procedures have been followed We also consider country-specific factors, including press freedom and we consult open-source research conducted by academics and leading experts. If an organization believes we have applied the label in error, they can submit an appeal. Through the appeal, they can provide additional documentation, which we will review against our definition. As we roll these labels out to more publishers over time, we welcome feedback and will continue to consult with experts and refine our approach."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/introducing-manage-activity/","date":"2020-06-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Manage Activity","text":"Whether you’re entering the job market after college or moving on from an old relationship, we know things change in people’s lives, and we want to make it easy for you to curate your presence on Facebook to more accurately reflect who you are today. That’s why we’re launching Manage Activity to help you archive or trash old posts, all in one place. The archive feature is for content you no longer want others to see on Facebook, but that you still want to keep for yourself. For example, you could archive a post you made when you were in high school that you still find amusing but that you’d rather not be seen by anyone else on Facebook. Manage Activity also allows you to move posts you no longer want to the trash. Posts sent to the trash will stay there for 30 days before being deleted unless you choose to manually delete or restore them before then. This gives you some wiggle room in case you change your mind about deleting old posts. And to make it simpler to manage lots of posts at once, Manage Activity lets you view and manage your posts in bulk. We’ve also developed filters to help you sort and find what you’re looking for, like posts with specific people or from a specific date range. Manage Activity will launch first on mobile and Facebook Lite, and will be available on desktop in the future. (Updated on June 2, 2020 at 1:52PM PT to clarify that Manage Activity is available on Facebook Lite today.)

In 2018, we started to verify the identity of people managing Pages with large audiences, and now we’re extending ID verification to some profiles with large audiences in the US. Moving forward, we will verify the identity of people who have a pattern of inauthentic behavior on Facebook and whose posts start to rapidly go viral in the US. We want people to feel confident that they understand who’s behind the content they’re seeing on Facebook and this is particularly important when it comes to content that’s reaching a lot of people. If someone chooses not to verify their identity or the ID provided does not match the linked Facebook account, the distribution of their viral post will remain reduced so fewer people will see it. In addition, if the person posting is a Page admin, they’ll need to complete Page Publishing Authorization and will not be able to post from their Page until their account is verified through our existing Page Publisher Authorization process. IDs will be stored securely and won’t be shared on the person’s profile. Visit the Help Center for more information on the types of IDs we accept.

That means friends and family, but also products, brands and businesses. For years, people have used our apps to buy and sell things from the early days of posting a photo of a bicycle with the caption “for sale,” to selling your coffee table on Marketplace and now shopping styles from your favorite brands and influencers on Instagram. It was the people who use our apps who envisioned social commerce. We’re helping them make it a reality. We want to give people a place to experience the joy of shopping versus the chore of buying. And we want to help small businesses adapt and make it easier for people to discover and shop for things they love. Right now many small businesses are struggling, and with stores closing, more are looking to bring their business online. Our goal is to make shopping seamless and empower anyone from a small business owner to a global brand to use our apps to connect with customers. That’s why we’re launching Facebook Shops and investing in features across our apps that inspire people to shop and make buying and selling online easier. Introducing Facebook Shops Facebook Shops make it easy for businesses to set up a single online store for customers to access on both Facebook and Instagram. Creating a Facebook Shop is free and simple. Businesses can choose the products they want to feature from their catalog and then customize the look and feel of their shop with a cover image and accent colors that showcase their brand. This means any seller, no matter their size or budget, can bring their business online and connect with customers wherever and whenever it’s convenient for them. People can find Facebook Shops on a business’ Facebook Page or Instagram profile, or discover them through stories or ads. From there, you can browse the full collection, save products you’re interested in and place an order — either on the business’ website or without leaving the app if the business has enabled checkout in the US. And just like when you’re in a physical store and need to ask someone for help, in Facebook Shops you’ll be able to message a business through WhatsApp, Messenger or Instagram Direct to ask questions, get support, track deliveries and more. And in the future, you’ll be able to view a business’ shop and make purchases right within a chat in WhatsApp, Messenger or Instagram Direct. We’re starting to roll out Facebook Shops today, and it will be more widely available in the coming months. You can learn more about how we built Shops with privacy in mind here. We’re also investing in features across our apps like Instagram Shop, live shopping and more that will be integrated with Facebook Shops to help customers discover products they’re interested in and make purchasing easier. Instagram Shop: A New Place to Discover Products and Brands This summer, starting in the US, we’re introducing Instagram Shop, a new way to discover and buy products you love in Instagram Explore. You can get inspired by collections from @shop, browse selections from your favorite brands and creators, filter by categories like beauty and home, and purchase the looks you love all in one place. And later this year, we’re adding a new shop tab in the navigation bar, so you can get to Instagram Shop in just one tap. Live Shopping Features People have been using live video on our apps to showcase products for years, from shoe stores announcing new sneakers to beauty influencers trying on different lipsticks. Now, we’re making it easier to shop for products in real time. Soon, sellers, brands and creators will be able to tag products from their Facebook Shop or catalog before going live and those products will be shown at the bottom of the video so people can easily tap to learn more and purchase. We’re starting to test this with businesses on Facebook and Instagram, and we’ll roll it out more broadly in the coming months. Connecting Loyalty Programs to Your Facebook Account We’re also testing ways to make it easier to earn rewards with businesses you love by enabling you to connect your loyalty programs, like the points program at your local cafe, to your Facebook account. You’ll be able to easily see and keep track of your points and rewards. And we’re exploring ways to help small businesses create, manage and surface a loyalty program on Facebook Shops. Working With Partners We’re also working more closely with partners like Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, ChannelAdvisor, CedCommerce, Cafe24, Tienda Nube and Feedonomics to give small businesses the support they need. These organizations offer powerful tools to help entrepreneurs start and run their businesses and move online. Now they’ll help small businesses build and grow their Facebook Shops and use our other commerce tools. We hope these tools can relieve some of the pressure small businesses are facing right now and help businesses of all sizes prepare for the future."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/graduation-week/","date":"2020-05-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Facebook","Instagram","Meta"],"title":"Graduation Week Is Here","text":"The music is cued and the speakers are ready: We’re celebrating the Class of 2020 with graduation week.

Over the years we’ve focused on how to help people feel present with one another even when they’re not in the same place. Today, video helps most of us bridge the distance. Tomorrow, we’ll be turning to more immersive platforms like AR and VR. Lately Facebook has felt the demand for real-time video. Between WhatsApp and Messenger, more than 700 million accounts participate in calls every day. In many countries, video calling on Messenger and WhatsApp more than doubled, and views of Facebook Live and Instagram Live videos increased significantly in March. But there’s more to do to make real-time feel real. Spending time with each other should be spontaneous, not strained. So to help people feel like they’re together, even when they are — or have to be — physically apart, we’re announcing features across our products that make video chat and live video easier and more natural. Introducing Messenger Rooms Messenger Rooms make it easy to spend quality time with friends, loved ones and people who share your interests. Create a room right from Messenger or Facebook, and invite anyone to join your video call, even if they don’t have a Facebook account. Rooms will soon hold up to 50 people with no time limit. Host celebrations, gather a book club or just hang out on the couch with friends. You don’t need to call someone and hope it’s a good time or check everyone’s calendar first. You can start and share rooms on Facebook through News Feed, Groups and Events, so it’s easy for people to drop by. Soon we’ll add ways to create rooms from Instagram Direct, WhatsApp and Portal, too. If your friends or communities create rooms that are open to you, you’ll see them on Facebook so you can find things to do and people to hang out with. When you’re invited to a room, you can join from your phone or computer — no need to download anything to get started. If you have the Messenger app, you can play with AR effects like bunny ears, and new AI-powered features like immersive 360 backgrounds and mood lighting. When you create a room, you choose who can see and join it. You can remove people from the call and lock a room if you don’t want anyone else to enter. Read more about the controls you have and how we built Rooms with privacy and security in mind. Messenger Rooms is rolling out in some countries this week and will expand to the rest of the world in coming weeks. Expanding WhatsApp Group Calls WhatsApp calls are another way to stay in touch. Soon you’ll be able to have group voice and video calls with up to eight people on WhatsApp. As before, these calls are secured with end-to-end encryption so no one else can view or listen to your private conversation, not even WhatsApp. New Live Video Features for Facebook, Instagram and Portal People are turning to Facebook Live and Instagram Live for workout classes, cooking lessons, faith services and more, so we’re adding features to make them even more useful. On Facebook… We’re bringing back Live With so you can add another person into your live video, no matter where they are in the world. Bring on a guest speaker, interview an expert or perform with a friend. You’ll be able to mark Facebook Events as online only and, in the coming weeks, integrate Facebook Live so you can broadcast to your guests. To support creators and small businesses, we plan to add the ability for Pages to charge for access to events with Live videos on Facebook – anything from online performances to classes to professional conferences. To help you raise money for causes, you can now add the donate button to live videos wherever nonprofit fundraisers are available. We’re making it easier to access live video so you can watch or listen anywhere. If you have limited data or a spotty connection, you now have the option to listen to the audio only. If you don’t have a Facebook account, most public live videos are now available on the web and some Pages can share a toll-free number that lets you listen to the audio through any telephone. You can livestream games from your phone to Facebook using the new Facebook Gaming app available on Google Play. The app also lets you play games instantly, watch your favorite streamers and discover new gaming groups. Tournaments are another new feature for game streaming that lets you create, play and watch the competition in one spot. Tournaments are available on Facebook today, and coming to the Facebook Gaming app soon. To help you support some of your favorite creators, we’re expanding Stars to more Pages and more countries. Once you buy Stars you can send them to creators while they’re streaming, and they’ll earn 1 cent for every Star. On Instagram… You can now watch and comment on live videos from your desktop. Follow along with that yoga class on a bigger screen or listen to a live performance as you work. After you go live, you’ll soon be able to save your videos to IGTV so they stick around longer than the 24-hour limit in Stories and are easier for others to find. On Portal… You’ll soon be able to go live from Portal to Facebook Pages and Groups. The Facebook Live app on Portal already lets you broadcast to your profile, but later this month you’ll be able to share with your communities, too. Whether you’re sharing a make-up or baking tutorial or hosting a more intimate conversation, Portal’s AI-powered Smart Camera can be your personal cinematographer, keeping you perfectly framed, so you can stay present in the moment. Messenger Kids Global Expansion and New Features Messenger Kids can help kids stay in touch with friends and family in a fun, parentally-supervised environment. We started expanding the free video calling and messaging app to more than 70 countries and adding new options to help parents connect kids with their friends. Set Up a Virtual Date in Facebook Dating To help people find meaningful relationships even when they can’t meet in person, we’re adding an option in Facebook Dating to invite people to a virtual date.

These include: The COVID-19 Map and Dashboard which include international results from our symptom survey as well as our movement range datasets that are informing the public sector response to COVID-19 around the world. Additional publicly available mobility datasets that show the rates at which different communities are reducing their mobility or remaining in the same place. These use aggregated data and we’ve applied a differential privacy framework to protect people’s privacy in creating and sharing these datasets. A new map showing travel patterns between countries and states to help researchers and NGOs understand how long distance travel continues to impact the spread of COVID-19. New insights from partners that have been using Disease Prevention Maps to better understand how COVID-19 may continue to spread as well as how the pandemic is affecting communities. A new survey about people’s knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19, conducted in partnership with the Initiative on the Digital Economy at MIT and advised by Johns Hopkins University Center for Communication Programs and the World Health Organization. You can learn more about how we protect people’s privacy in our Data for Good tools here. Update on April 20, 2020 at 3:15AM PT: Today Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Delphi Research Center made public the initial results of their US symptom survey we promoted on Facebook. Using aggregate data from Carnegie Mellon, Facebook produced its first report and new interactive maps, which we plan to update daily through this outbreak. Mark Zuckerberg wrote in the Washington Post about how surveys like this can be an important tool in fighting COVID-19 and announced that we’re working with faculty from the University of Maryland to expand the program globally. Original post published on April 6, 2020 at 12PM PT: Flattening the global COVID-19 curve is a challenge that takes all of us. As people distance themselves to protect their communities and healthcare workers save lives on the front lines, hospitals are working to get the right resources, and public health systems are looking to put the right guidelines in place. To do that, they need better information on whether preventive measures are working and how the virus may spread. As part of Facebook’s Data for Good program, we offer maps on population movement that researchers and nonprofits are already using to understand the coronavirus crisis, using aggregated data to protect people’s privacy. We heard from them how valuable this information can be in responding to COVID-19, and today we’re announcing new tools to support their work: Three new types of Disease Prevention Maps to help inform disease forecasting efforts and protective measures A prompt on Facebook encouraging people in the US to participate in a voluntary survey from Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Research Center designed to help health researchers identify COVID-19 hotspots earlier Providing New Tools for Disease Prevention Our Disease Prevention Maps are aggregated sets of information that health researchers can use to better understand how population dynamics influence the spread of disease. Researchers and health experts around the world have advocated for more of this information to respond to the pandemic, so today, we’re sharing three new tools: Co-location maps reveal the probability that people in one area will come in contact with people in another, helping illuminate where COVID-19 cases may appear next. Co-location patterns, like these in Italy, can help disease modelers determine how COVID-19 might spread. Movement range trends show at a regional level whether people are staying near home or visiting many parts of town, which can provide insights into whether preventive measures are headed in the right direction. Movement range trends, like these for Brazil, show whether people in different regions are visiting many areas. The social connectedness index shows friendships across states and countries, which can help epidemiologists forecast the likelihood of disease spread, as well as where areas hardest hit by COVID-19 might seek support. This map shows how connected parts of the US are to the East Village, NY, on Facebook, revealing how social ties may help communities combat and recover from the crisis. Disease Prevention Maps aggregate information from Facebook, and we take additional steps to obscure people’s identities and reduce the risk that anyone could be re-identified. For example, our datasets can show information at a city or county level, not the patterns of individuals. You can read more about our approach to protecting people’s privacy on our Data for Good site. “COVID-19 has inherent delays that challenge the pace at which we seek to evaluate policy impact towards a measured response. Mobility data from Facebook’s Data for Good program provides a near real-time view of important correlates of disease transmission. This data, in combination with other sources, allows us to make better models to inform public health decisions.” – Daniel Klein, Ph.D., Institute for Disease Modeling Launching a Survey for Health Researchers to Track COVID-19 Starting today in the US, some people will see a link at the top of News Feed to an optional, off-Facebook survey to help health researchers better monitor and forecast the spread of COVID-19. The survey — run by Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Research Center — will be used to generate new insights on how to respond to the crisis, including heat maps of self-reported symptoms. This information can help health systems plan where resources are needed and potentially when, where and how to reopen parts of society. If the results are helpful, we’ll make similar surveys available in other parts of the world. CMU Delphi Research won’t share individual survey responses with Facebook, and Facebook won’t share information about who you are with the researchers. To help them measure results while protecting your privacy, we’ll share a random ID number that CMU will send back to us when someone completes the survey. Then we’ll share a single statistic known as a weight value that doesn’t identify you but helps correct for any sample bias. Building a Global Network of Research Partners Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve partnered with dozens of trusted organizations to use Disease Prevention Maps to aid relief efforts. These partners include universities like Harvard School of Public Health in the US, National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, and University of Pavia in Italy, as well as nonprofits and institutions such as Direct Relief, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Bank. These partners have established the COVID-19 mobility data network, a global coalition to provide real-time insights from Facebook’s Data for Good tools. This network is already actively supporting the response around the world. “Measuring the impact of social distancing policies is absolutely critical at this stage, and aggregated data of this kind provides insights that protect individual privacy but are actionable for policymakers and researchers building predictive models.” -Caroline Buckee, Associate Director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health Protecting Privacy Facebook and the wider technology industry can — and must — continue to find innovative ways to help health experts and authorities respond to this crisis, without trading off privacy. Our Data for Good tools are designed to protect your information, and we have public guidelines on how we respond to government requests for data. We will continue to be transparent about our approach and consult with policymakers, regulators and other privacy experts about our practices.

While our Community Standards protect against the most egregious harms like hate speech and terrorism, sometimes all it takes is one person being rude, mean or simply disruptive to ruin a conversation for everyone. And what may be considered competitive banter in one streaming community, might be considered toxic in another. Gaming creators are tone setters, so that’s why we’re releasing a toolkit to help them set guidelines for positive conversations in their community. We worked with the Fair Play Alliance, a coalition of game companies encouraging healthy communities in online gaming, and partnered directly with their Executive Steering Committee, to establish rules creators and moderators can use to set guidelines and help avoid disruptive comments. People form communities over a shared love of gaming, but we know some groups of people, like women, can be targets of negative, hurtful stereotypes — so, rules like “Be Accepting” and “Respect Boundaries” can help maintain a positive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or ability. Similarly, “Don’t Criticize” can help newer players feel welcome. The rules will promote inclusion and respect to help people feel safe sharing their voice. Using the Toolkit Creators will be able to access the toolkit rules through a Chat Rules button in the streamer dashboard. While creators often list chat rules in their Page description or at the bottom of a stream, the new toolkit makes rules more visible and gives creators a baseline of eight preset rules to start with. We’ll expand and update the rules based on feedback from creators and the way gaming community conversations evolve. We’re testing these rules now with a small group of creators and we’ll roll them out globally in the coming months. The toolkit will offer four new features: Clear Standards: Creators can select from a list of gaming-specific rules for their community before they go live. They can also add a custom description about their stream to help set expectations about type of conversation they want to foster. Once a creator selects rules from the Chat Rules section of the streamer dashboard, fans will be asked to accept the rules before they’re allowed to leave a comment. Content Removals: We’ve made comment removals happen in real time, so when a comment is removed or someone is banned, their comments will disappear from the stream immediately. Transparency in Moderation: Moderators will also now be able to select which rules were violated so the fan can receive feedback about why their content was removed. This level of transparency will help creators educate their audience and inform well-intentioned fans who may have inadvertently broken a rule. Moderation Dashboard: In addition to these rules, moderators will now have access to a new moderation dashboard with resources to prevent harassment, protect their privacy and help ensure creators feel safe. With the new toolkit, creators and moderators will still be able to remove comments, mute viewers for a short period of time or ban people from their Page or stream. Once someone is banned they will still be able to watch the stream but won’t be able to comment or react to the stream or other people, and their previous comments will be removed. We know gaming has changed over time, and so have the people who play, so it’s important for us to support creators and their moderators by helping set guidelines for positive conversations. Our work doesn’t end here — we’re excited to continue partnering with the Fair Play Alliance to develop additional features and ensure creators and fans alike can find safe and inclusive communities on Facebook."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/01/data-privacy-day-2020/","date":"2020-01-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Giving You More Control Over Your Privacy","text":"One of our main goals for the next decade is to build much stronger privacy protections for everyone on Facebook.

To help you keep track of your activity, we rolled out Login Notifications earlier this month. These notifications alert you when you use Facebook Login to sign in to third-party apps to help you stay aware of how your account is being used and edit your settings. You should be able to easily understand and manage your information, which is why strengthening your privacy controls is so important.

People have created more than 19,000 fundraisers on Facebook that have raised over $50 million USD for relief efforts, with support and donations coming from more than 75 countries. Australian actor and comedian Celeste Barber created a fundraiser that has raised more than $34 million USD for fire relief efforts from more than 1 million people around the world, making it the largest-ever fundraiser on Facebook. We know how critical funds are in the wake of a crisis, so we worked to expedite payouts, which began today. Another fundraiser for the NSW Wildlife Information and Rescue Service has raised more than $9 million USD from nearly 300,000 people to support the millions of species endangered by the wildfires, including 30% of the koala population. People affected by the wildfires are also coming together using Facebook Groups to share information, find important resources and support one another. There are more than 9,000 members in the Bushfire Emergency accommodation in Canberra group connecting people evacuating their homes with those who can provide accommodations. And knitters from around the world are coming together in the Animal Rescue Craft Guild group to create handmade pouches and mittens for injured animals. To help support and amplify our community’s efforts, Facebook has matched AU$1 million (approximately $685,000 USD) in donations made to GlobalGiving, which is directing funds to local, community-led relief organizations in Australia. We also donated AU$250,000 (approximately $171,000 USD) to the Australian Red Cross to support relief and recovery efforts. Thank you to everyone who has donated and supported those affected.

The defendants deceived people into installing malware available on the internet. This malware then enabled the defendants to compromise people’s Facebook accounts and run deceptive ads promoting items such as counterfeit goods and diet pills. The suit seeks to hold accountable ILikeAd Media International Company Ltd. and Chen Xiao Cong and Huang Tao for creating the malware, tricking people into installing it, compromising people’s Facebook accounts and then using people’s accounts to run deceptive ads. The defendants sometimes used images of celebrities in their ads to entice people to click on them, a practice known as “celeb bait.” In some instances, the defendants also engaged in a practice known as cloaking. Through cloaking, the defendants deliberately disguised the true destination of the link in the ad by displaying one version of an ad’s landing page to Facebook’s systems and a different version to Facebook users. Cloaking schemes are often sophisticated and well organized, making the individuals and organizations behind them difficult to identify and hold accountable. As a result, there have not been many legal actions of this kind. In this case, we have refunded victims whose accounts were used to run unauthorized ads and helped them to secure their accounts. To protect Facebook users and disrupt these types of schemes, we will continue our work to detect malicious behavior directed towards our platform and enforce against violations of our Terms and Policies.

The tool will be available globally within the next few months. Originally published on December 2, 2019 at 1:00 PM PT: At Facebook, we believe that if you share data with one service, you should be able to move it to another. That’s the principle of data portability, which gives people control and choice while also encouraging innovation. Today, we’re releasing a tool that will enable Facebook users to transfer their Facebook photos and videos directly to other services, starting with Google Photos. In September, we published a white paper that explores the privacy questions we’re discussing as we build a new generation of data portability tools. Since then, we’ve had conversations with stakeholders around the world — from the UK and Germany to Brazil and Singapore — to get feedback about what data should be portable and how to ensure that we protect privacy when enabling data transfers. We’ve learned from our conversations with policymakers, regulators, academics, advocates and others that real-world use cases and tools will help drive policy discussions forward. That’s why we’re developing new products that take into account the feedback we’ve received and will help drive data portability policies forward by giving people and experts a tool to assess. For almost a decade, we’ve enabled people to download their information from Facebook. The photo transfer tool we’re starting to roll out today is based on code developed through our participation in the open-source Data Transfer Project and will first be available to people in Ireland, with worldwide availability planned for the first half of 2020. People can access this new tool in Facebook settings within Your Facebook Information, the same place where you can download your information. We’ve kept privacy and security as top priorities, so all data transferred will be encrypted and people will be asked to enter their password before a transfer is initiated. We are currently testing this tool, so we will continue refining it based on feedback from people using it as well as from our conversations with stakeholders. We want to build practical portability solutions people can trust and use effectively. To foster that trust, people and online services need clear rules about what kinds of data should be portable and who is responsible for protecting that data as it moves to different services. We hope this product can help advance conversations on the privacy questions we identified in our white paper. We know we can’t do this alone, so we encourage other companies to join the Data Transfer Project to expand options for people and continue to push data portability innovation forward."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/a-nation-of-nurses/","date":"2019-11-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook"],"title":"A Nation of Nurses Comes Together After a Crisis","text":"A Facebook Group for nurses, Show Me Your Stethoscope | A Nation of Nurses, shows support for first responders after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017 and their community bonds like never before."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/healing-together/","date":"2019-11-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook"],"title":"Healing Together","text":"In honor of Veterans Day, we have a story about Sgt.

Today we’re sharing an update on some of this work, including a new Preventive Health tool in the US. We’re working with US health organizations to offer a Preventive Health tool that connects people to health resources and checkup reminders. People can use the tool to find affordable places to receive care, set reminders to schedule tests, mark when tests are completed, and more. By Freddy Abnousi, MD, Head of Healthcare Research Many of today’s leading health threats aren’t ones that science or medicine can solve alone. Changing trends in communication and unequal access to care mean we need new solutions and partnerships to overcome these global challenges. Take the issue of blood shortages. Every few seconds, someone in the world needs blood. But people often aren’t aware of shortages and don’t know where to donate. To address this, we launched a feature in the US, India, Brazil, Bangladesh and Pakistan that makes it easy to sign up as a donor on Facebook and get notified when nearby blood banks are in need. So far, more than 50 million people have signed up to donate. Another area we’re exploring is preventive health. Tens of millions of people in the US are missing out on recommended preventive care, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Preventive measures have the potential to detect disease early when it’s most treatable and, in some cases, prevent it from developing. Yet factors such as awareness, access and cost create barriers to testing for many people. To help, we’re working with US health organizations to offer a new Preventive Health tool that connects people to health resources and checkup reminders. Our initial focus is on the top two leading causes of death in the US: heart disease and cancer, (according to CDC) as well as the flu, a seasonal illness that affects millions each year. The resources available in the tool are provided by the American Cancer Society, the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — organizations recognized for their education and expertise in these areas. “Heart disease is the number one killer of men and women around the world and in many cases it is 100% preventable. By incorporating prevention reminders into platforms people are accessing every day, we’re giving people the tools they need to be proactive about their heart health.” – Richard Kovacs, MD, President of the American College of Cardiology How Preventive Health Works In the US, people can search for Preventive Health in the Facebook mobile app and find out which checkups, such as cholesterol tests or mammograms, are recommended by these health organizations based on the age and sex they provide. Reminders for flu shots will also appear at the appropriate time of year. The tool allows people to mark when tests are completed, set reminders to schedule future tests and tell loved ones about the tool to increase awareness of preventive care. People can also learn more about each checkup and find affordable places to receive care. “We’ve contributed our content and resources to the Facebook Preventive Health tool to empower Americans to take the first step to know about and take action to lower blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol, each of which has been shown to increase the chance of a longer, healthier life and reduce the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke.” – Eduardo Sanchez, MD, Chief Medical Officer for Prevention at the American Heart Association “One of the main reasons people don’t get screened for cancer is that they don’t realize their own risk. We hope this program will help by building awareness about important recommendations from expert organizations.” – Richard Wender, MD, Chief Cancer Control Officer at the American Cancer Society Most of the preventive measures recommended by the health organizations we’re working with, such as blood pressure tests, are free of charge with insurance coverage, but we know many people do not have insurance. To help people get affordable care, Preventive Health offers a way to find Federally Qualified Health Centers near them. These centers are located in underserved areas and provide care to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. People can also use Preventive Health to find convenient locations that offer flu shots, such as grocery stores, pharmacies and urgent care clinics. “Flu vaccines can have wide-ranging benefits beyond just preventing the disease, such as reducing the risk of hospitalization, preventing serious medical events for some people with chronic diseases, and protecting women during and after pregnancy. New tools like this will empower users with instant access to information and resources they need to become a flu fighter in their own communities.” – Nancy Messonnier, MD, Director, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC Over time, we’ll work with additional organizations to include more resources and expand to other countries. Privacy Matters Health is particularly personal, so we took privacy and safety into account from the beginning. For example, Preventive Health allows you to set reminders for your future checkups and mark them as done, but it doesn’t provide us, or the health organizations we’re working with, access to your actual test results. Personal information about your activity in Preventive Health is not shared with third parties, such as health organizations or insurance companies, so it can’t be used for purposes like insurance eligibility. We don’t show ads based on the information you provide in Preventive Health — that includes things like setting a reminder for a test, marking it as done or searching for a healthcare location. As always, other actions that you take on Facebook could inform the ads you see, for example, liking the Facebook page of a health organization or visiting an external website linked to from Preventive Health. To learn more about Preventive Health and privacy, see this post. Our Efforts Across Health Preventive Health and Blood Donations are just two of the ways we can help people advocate for their own health and help others: According to our blood bank partners in India and Brazil, 20% of voluntary, walk-in blood donors are coming from Facebook. Disease Prevention Maps from Facebook help nonprofits and universities working in public health get ahead of disease outbreaks, plan vaccination campaigns and reach vulnerable communities more effectively. People turn to health support groups on Facebook after being diagnosed with or while managing a health condition, to connect with others who have had similar health experiences and find information and support. We know there’s more we can do to help people, and we’ll continue to partner with organizations to provide access to resources and reach people in diverse communities.

Information you provide is securely stored and access is restricted to a group of people at Facebook who work on the product or maintain our systems. We don’t share personal information about your activity in Preventive Health with third parties, such as health organizations or insurance companies, so it can’t be used for purposes like insurance eligibility. What choices and controls do I have? You can decide whether you want to use the Preventive Health tool. The tool will give you options to set reminders for your future checkups and mark them as done, but it will not give us access to your actual test results. If you choose, you can share the tool with your friends or family through Messenger or News Feed to encourage them to try it, but doing so will not share your activity within the tool. If you have Location Services turned on, we can use that information to show you Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in your area. If not, we default to showing a location based on your current city. You can control whether your device shares precise location information with Facebook Products via Location Services, a setting on your mobile device. How does this impact data collection and the ads I see? Preventive Health uses your age and sex to suggest checkups recommended by health organizations. Your age and sex is based on your Facebook profile by default, but you can change these in the Preventive Health tool. To help you keep track of your checkups, we collect information you provide, such as when you set reminders or mark a screening as done. We also log more general activity, like frequency of clicks for a specific button, which allows us to understand how the tool is being used, in order to improve it over time. We don’t show ads based on the information you provide in Preventive Health — that includes things like setting a reminder for a test, marking it as done or searching for a healthcare location. As always, other actions that you take on Facebook could inform the ads you see, for example, liking the Facebook page of a health organization or visiting an external website linked to from Preventive Health."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/10/introducing-facebook-news/","date":"2019-10-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Facebook News","text":"Testing a dedicated place for news in the US Journalism plays a critical role in our democracy. When news is deeply-reported and well-sourced it gives people information they can rely on. When it’s not, we lose an essential tool for making good decisions. People want and benefit from personalized experiences on Facebook, but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience. We want to support both. Today we’re starting to test Facebook News, a dedicated place for news on Facebook, to a subset of people in the US. News gives people more control over the stories they see, and the ability to explore a wider range of their news interests, directly within the Facebook app. It also highlights the most relevant national stories of the day. News articles will continue to appear in News Feed as they do today. As we looked to build a place where people can find more news on Facebook, we changed our approach to gather insight from journalists and publishers before we started developing a product. As Mark Zuckerberg said in a conversation with Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Europe’s largest publisher Axel Springer, we wanted to build this product in a consultative way, sharing our ideas and getting input from the industry. We talked to news organizations about what they’d like to see included in a news tab, how their stories should be presented and what analytics to provide. As we talked to people and publishers, we identified key features to help make Facebook News valuable: Today’s Stories chosen by a team of journalists to catch you up on the news throughout the day Personalization based on the news you read, share and follow, so you can find new interests and topics and Facebook News is fresh and interesting every time you open it Topic sections to dive deeper into business, entertainment, health, science & tech, and sports Your Subscriptions, a section for people who have linked their paid news subscriptions to their Facebook account Controls to hide articles, topics and publishers you don’t want to see Regarding personalization, publishers worry that machine learning has limits and they’re right. We have progress to make before we can rely on technology alone to provide a quality news destination. We also aim to serve both people and news publishers, and not just the big national players. We want new forms of journalism in the digital age, including individual, independent journalism, to flourish. So we will continue to expand the algorithmic selection of stories driving the majority of Facebook News. When we started talking to news organizations about building Facebook News earlier this year, they emphasized that original reporting is more expensive to produce and better recognized by seasoned journalists than by algorithms. So to help reward this kind of work, we formed a curation team to manage the Today’s Stories section of Facebook News. The team will have editorial independence and will select stories based on publicly available guidelines, which you can learn about at facebook.com/news. What You Can Expect to See in Facebook News Facebook News will feature a wide range of content across four categories of publishers: general, topical, diverse and local news. At the beginning of the year, we surveyed over 100,000 people on Facebook in the US about what topics they were most interested in and found that we were under-serving many topics people wanted most in their News Feeds, especially around categories like entertainment, health, business and sports. We took this into consideration as we identified publishers across those four categories. How do we identify these publishers? They need to be in our News Page Index, which we developed in collaboration with the industry to identify news content. They also need to abide by Facebook’s Publisher Guidelines, these include a range of integrity signals in determining product eligibility, including misinformation — as identified based on third-party fact checkers — community standards violations (e.g., hate speech), clickbait, engagement bait and others. We’ll continually check Pages’ integrity status to ensure eligibility criteria is consistently being met. Lastly, they must serve a sufficiently large audience, with different thresholds for the four categories of publishers. Our criteria will evolve over time to make sure people are seeing sources that are valuable to them and that we’re including reporting across these topics. During the initial test, we’ll showcase local original reporting by surfacing local publications from the largest major metro areas across the country, beginning with New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington DC, Miami, Atlanta and Boston. In the coming months, we’ll include local news from Today In, our local news and community information tab, which recently expanded to over 6,000 US towns and cities. Facebook News was built to bring people closer to the stories that affect their lives. We’ll continue to learn, listen and improve News as it rolls out more broadly. We hope this work aids in our effort to sustain great journalism and strengthen democracy."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/2-billion-for-causes/","date":"2019-09-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"People Raise Over $2 Billion for Causes on Facebook","text":"Update on February 6, 2020 at 9:15AM PT: People have now raised over $3 billion for personal fundraisers and nonprofit causes on Facebook. Thank you to everyone who has started or supported a fundraiser using these tools – it’s amazing to see the impact you continue to make. $1 Billion Raised Through Birthday Fundraisers By Naomi Gleit, VP, Product Management Five years ago, many of us drenched ourselves in ice water to raise awareness and money for ALS, spurring major developments to fight the disease. Not only did the Ice Bucket Challenge inspire millions of people to help those with ALS, it was the inspiration behind our first fundraising tools in 2015. Since then, people have raised over $2 billion to support the people and causes they care about on Facebook, with $1 billion of that coming from birthday fundraisers alone. By dedicating their special day to a nonprofit organization, people rally their friends and family to support important causes. From birthdays and Giving Tuesday to anytime throughout the year, over 45 million people have donated to or created a fundraiser on Facebook — which has more than doubled since last November. Through Facebook Fundraisers, people have supported these organizations and many more: The ALS Association has raised over $5 million using Facebook Fundraisers to help fuel their research and new breakthroughs for those with ALS. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital supporters have given over $100M to ensure that no family ever receives a bill for treatment, travel, housing or food, because all a family should have to worry about is helping their child live. Veteran’s Matter has raised over $50,000 and housed over 100 veterans in 21 states. No Kid Hungry has raised enough money to connect kids with up to 100 million additional meals. Please Take Me There has provided 1,700 journeys to and from the hospital, helping 681 children with cancer and living in extreme poverty to receive the diagnosis and treatment they need. March of Dimes has raised more than $6 million to support healthy moms and strong babies because it’s unacceptable that every 12 hours a mom dies as a result of pregnancy or childbirth, and nearly half a million babies in the US are born prematurely or with birth defects each year. Fisher House Foundation has raised nearly $400K to support our military, veterans and their families during their greatest times of need: when their loved ones are receiving care at Departments of Defense (DOD) or Veterans Affairs hospitals, and the donations are equivalent to 40,000 nights families can stay at DOD Fisher Houses. Thank you to everyone who supported these causes, and so many others. We know that $2 billion is just the start to the amount of impact our community will have. Instagram Donation Sticker Comes to Europe Since we launched donation stickers on Instagram in the US earlier this year, we’ve seen how Instagram can be used for fundraising in addition to building awareness for causes. To help more people easily raise money for nonprofits through Instagram Stories, we recently expanded the donation sticker to Europe. Like all nonprofit fundraisers created on Facebook, 100% of the money raised goes to the organizations. We are grateful to everyone around the world who has donated to or started a fundraiser using our apps. On behalf of the organizations and people who have benefited from your passion and generosity, thank you."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/understanding-updates-to-your-devices-location-settings/","date":"2019-09-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Understanding Updates to Your Device’s Location Settings","text":"By Paul McDonald, Engineering Director, Location Platform Facebook is better with location. It powers features like check-ins and makes planning events easier. It helps improve ads and keep you and the Facebook community safe. Features like Find Wi-Fi and Nearby Friends use precise location even when you’re not using the app to make sure that alerts and tools are accurate and personalized for you. Your Android or iOS location settings allow you to control when you share your device’s precise location with apps like Facebook. That’s why we’re letting you know that Android and iOS have released new versions of their operating systems, which include updates to how you can view and manage your location. The newest version of Android, called Android 10, gives people more visibility into and control over when apps can access their device’s precise location. The new version of iOS, called iOS 13, will send people reminders about which apps can access their precise location information when they’re not using an app and how many times each app has accessed it. Android 10 Previous Android versions offer an on/off switch for controlling an app’s access to your device’s precise location information. Earlier this year we introduced the Facebook background location setting to give people on Android a dedicated way to control whether their device’s precise location was being shared with Facebook even when you’re not using the app. If you decide to update to Android 10, you’ll have the option to allow individual apps to access your precise location, either while you’re using the app or when you’re not. We understand that this may be confusing if you’re already using Facebook’s background location setting, and this update may cause a few instances where the Android and Facebook location settings will be out of sync. To address this issue, Facebook will continue to respect your most restrictive settings choice. For example, if your device location setting is set to “all of the time,” but your Facebook background location setting is off, we won’t collect your precise location information when you’re not using the Facebook app. We’ll also begin to phase out the Facebook background location setting on Android 10 by reminding people to check their device’s location settings to make sure what they’ve chosen is right for them. Location Access Settings in Facebook for Android iOS 13 On iOS devices, you currently have three options to share your precise location with an app: always, only when the app is in use or never. If you decide to update to iOS 13, you will see an additional option called “allow once,” which lets an app access your device’s precise location information only once. If you are using iOS 13, you will begin to receive notifications about when an app is using your precise location in the background and how many times an app has accessed that information. The notification will also include a map of the location data an app has received and an explanation of why the app uses that type of location information. Privacy Matters You’re in control of who sees your location on Facebook. You can control whether your device shares precise location information with Facebook via Location Services, a setting on your phone or tablet. We may still understand your location using things like check-ins, events and information about your internet connection. We’ll continue to make it easier for you to control how and when you share your location. We’re always building new features to help you explore the world around you, including Local Alerts to keep you informed on breaking news and the new map in the Events tab to help you find things to do with friends nearby."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/facebook-dating/","date":"2019-09-04T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"It’s Facebook Official, Dating Is Here","text":"Update on November 22, 2021 at 2:20PM PT: Some information in this post has changed. See the latest privacy information for Facebook Dating. Originally published on September 5, 2019 at 6:45PM PT: Facebook Dating makes it easier to find love through what you like — helping you start meaningful relationships through things you have in common, like interests, events and groups. It takes the work out of creating a dating profile and gives you a more authentic look at who someone is. Today, we’re launching Facebook Dating in the US. We’re also giving people the ability to integrate their Instagram posts directly into their Facebook Dating profile and giving people the ability to add Instagram followers to their Secret Crush lists, in addition to Facebook friends. By the end of the year, we’ll make it possible to add Facebook and Instagram Stories to your Dating profile too. Finding a romantic partner is deeply personal, which is why we built Dating to be safe, inclusive and opt-in. Safety, security and privacy are at the forefront of this product. We worked with experts in these areas to build protections into Facebook Dating from the start, including the ability to report and block anyone; prohibiting people from sending photos, links, payments or videos in messages; and by providing easy access to safety tips. These features and others give you more control and peace of mind. Learn more about privacy and Facebook Dating here. How It Works Starting today, you can choose to opt into Facebook Dating and create a Dating profile (separate from your main profile) if you’re 18 years or older and have downloaded the most recent version of Facebook. You will be suggested to others who have also opted in. People are suggested based on your preferences, interests and other things you do on Facebook. Facebook Dating isn’t about swiping or having to wait for someone to like you to get a first chance at reaching out. If you are interested in someone, you can comment directly on their profile or tap on the Like button to let them know. If you aren’t interested, you can pass on them. Facebook Dating allows you to match with friends of friends and/or people not in your friend circle. Facebook Dating won’t match you with friends, unless you choose to use Secret Crush and you both add each other to your list. All of your Dating activity will stay in Facebook Dating. It won’t be shared to the rest of Facebook. Key Features People will soon be able to connect and share with Facebook and Instagram Stories. Today people are asked to make a decision as to whether or not they like someone immediately based on a static profile. To help you show, rather than tell, who you are, we’re bringing Stories to Dating. This format lets you be authentic in a way that a typical dating profile can’t, and it helps you get to know someone before and after you match. Concept only. Not final design. Secret Crush lets you match with people you already know on Facebook and/or Instagram. By default, Facebook Dating won’t match you with your Facebook Friends, but people told us they were interested in exploring potential romantic relationships within their extended circles, like their Facebook friend list and Instagram followers. Our popular Secret Crush feature gives you the option to do just that. If you choose to use Secret Crush, you can select up to nine of your Facebook friends or Instagram followers who you’re interested in. (To add Instagram followers you must connect your Instagram account to Facebook Dating.) If your crush has opted into Facebook Dating, they’ll get a notification saying that someone has a crush on them. If your crush adds you to their Secret Crush list too, it’s a match! If your crush isn’t on Dating, doesn’t create a Secret Crush list, or doesn’t put you on their list — then no one will know that you’ve entered their name. You can now add your Instagram posts to your profile in Facebook Dating. Adding Instagram posts to your profile will make it easier to build a better dating profile, show aspects of your life to others, and find shared connections that spark conversation. Opt into Events and Groups to see people with similar interests.You can choose to see other people who are using Facebook Dating that fit your preferences within the groups you are part of and the events you have attended or will be attending. When you choose to see these people, you will also be visible to them. Feel safe by sharing details of your date. People using Facebook Dating can share details of their upcoming date and/or live location with someone they trust via Messenger. They will be able to control if they want to choose this feature. If they do, they are in control of who they share this information with. Creating your Dating profile is easier than ever. Based on feedback from people using Dating in other countries, we’ve made it easier to create a Facebook Dating profile. With one tap, we’ll suggest photos and information from your Facebook profile, which you can edit or remove. You can also create your own Dating profile from scratch. Availability In addition to the US, Facebook Dating is currently available in 19 other countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Suriname, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam. It will be in Europe by early 2020.

See the latest privacy information for Facebook Dating. Originally published on September 5, 2019 at 6:45AM PT: People use Facebook to connect with friends and meet new ones, and many people already use Facebook to start relationships. That’s why we built Facebook Dating to help people find people they may want to date. Privacy is particularly important when it comes to dating, so we consulted with experts in privacy and consumer protection and embedded privacy protections into the core of Facebook Dating. Opt-in Experience: Not everyone on Facebook is interested in dating, which is why we made Facebook Dating a separate, opt-in experience. That means we won’t create a Facebook Dating profile for your account unless you specifically choose to create one. And you can delete your Dating profile at any time. Audience: If you do create a Facebook Dating profile, only your first name and your age will come with you from your Facebook profile. For all other information, such as your gender identity, who you are interested in, photos and more, you choose whether to share it on your Dating profile. You can also choose how you want to present yourself to potential matches, like whether you provide different information than you have on your Facebook profile, and if you share details such as your hometown, religion, occupation and more within Dating. In fact, we chose not to show your gender identity to potential matches in order to respect people’s privacy. Choice and Control: Facebook Dating is a dedicated space within the Facebook app, and we won’t share your dating activity to your Facebook profile or News Feed. You control who on Facebook can see your Dating profile. Also, your Facebook friends won’t know you’re using Dating unless you choose to tell them. Your current Facebook friends will never be suggested as matches, and you can choose whether you want friends of your Facebook friends suggested as matches — or if you’d prefer to match with people outside your friends of friends. Anyone you’ve blocked will not be suggested to you. The people who will see your Dating profile are the people suggested to you, the people to whom you’re suggested, and the people you add as crushes in Secret Crush. Data Collection and Use: Your match suggestions within Dating are based on your preferences, interests and other things you do on Facebook to help you connect with people based on things you may have in common. Your Dating activity, such as people you like or pass on, won’t be shared with anyone outside Dating. If you choose to link your Instagram account to your Dating profile you can show your Instagram posts on your Dating profile or add your Instagram followers to your Secret Crush list. We’re committed to protecting people’s privacy within Facebook Dating so that we can create a place where people feel comfortable looking for a date and starting meaningful relationships."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/update-face-recognition/","date":"2019-09-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"An Update About Face Recognition on Facebook","text":"By Srinivas Narayanan, Applied Research Lead, Facebook AI Facebook has always given you control over whether we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos. This setting was previously called tag suggestions because Facebook only used face recognition technology to automatically suggest tags of your friends in photos. In December 2017, we introduced a new setting for some people called face recognition. Our face recognition setting lets you manage not only whether Facebook uses face recognition technology on photos of you in order to suggest tags; it provides an easy on or off switch for a broader set of uses of face recognition, such as helping you protect your identity on Facebook. Starting today, people who newly join Facebook or who previously had the tag suggestions setting will have the face recognition setting and will receive information about how it works. The tag suggestions setting, which only controls whether we can suggest that your friends tag you in photos or videos using face recognition will no longer be available. Letting People Know People who still have the tag suggestions setting will begin to see a notice in their News Feed today. The notice will include information about the new features and options to learn more about how we use face recognition, along with a button to turn it on or keep it off. If you do not currently have the face recognition setting and do nothing, we will not use face recognition to recognize you or suggest tags. In addition, features like Photo Review, which lets you know when you appear in photos even if you are not tagged, as long as you have permission to see the post based on its privacy setting, will not be activated. People will still be able to manually tag friends, but we won’t suggest you to be tagged if you do not have face recognition turned on. If you already have the face recognition setting, you won’t receive a notice. Privacy Matters We’ve continued to engage with privacy experts, academics, regulators and people on Facebook about how we use face recognition and the options you have to control it. We’ve made the steps to update your settings clearer and you can opt to leave your setting off right in the notice, as opposed to having to go to a separate screen. If you do nothing, face recognition will remain off for you. There’s also an opportunity to review information about our technology and the features it powers so that you can make the choice that’s right for you. Finally, Facebook’s face recognition technology still does not recognize you to strangers. We don’t share your face recognition information with third parties. We also don’t sell our technology. These changes will be effective globally starting today."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/off-facebook-activity/","date":"2019-08-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Now You Can See and Control the Data That Apps and Websites Share With Facebook","text":"By Erin Egan, Chief Privacy Officer, Policy, and David Baser, Director of Product Management Many apps and websites are free because they’re supported by online advertising. And to reach people who are more likely to care about what they are selling, businesses often share data about people’s interactions on their websites with ad platforms and other services. This is how much of the internet works, but given that the average person with a smartphone has more than 80 apps and uses about 40 of them every month, it can be really difficult for people to keep track of who has information about them and what it’s used for. To help shed more light on these practices that are common yet not always well understood, today we’re introducing a new way to view and control your off-Facebook activity. Off-Facebook Activity lets you see a summary of the apps and websites that send us information about your activity, and clear this information from your account if you want to. This is another way to give people more transparency and control on Facebook, along with recent updates to our Ad Library, updates to “Why am I seeing this ad?” and the launch of a new feature called “Why am I seeing this post?”. What Is Off-Facebook Activity? Imagine a clothing website wants to show ads to people who are interested in a new style of shoes. They can send information to Facebook saying someone on a particular device looked at those shoes. If that device information matches someone’s Facebook account, we can show ads about those shoes to that person. To explain this further, we put together some resources here. With Off-Facebook Activity, you can see and control the data that other apps and websites share with Facebook. You can: See a summary of the information other apps and websites have sent Facebook through our online business tools, like Facebook Pixel or Facebook Login; Disconnect this information from your account if you want to; and Choose to disconnect future off-Facebook activity from your account. You can do this for all of your off-Facebook activity, or just for specific apps and websites. We are starting by gradually making Off-Facebook Activity available to people in Ireland, South Korea and Spain. We will continue to roll it out everywhere over the coming months to help ensure it’s working reliably for everyone. (Updated on August 20, 2019 at 11:40AM PT to include additional screenshots of the product.) What Happens When You Clear Your Off-Facebook Activity If you clear your off-Facebook activity, we’ll remove your identifying information from the data that apps and websites choose to send us. We won’t know which websites you visited or what you did there, and we won’t use any of the data you disconnect to target ads to you on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We expect this could have some impact on our business, but we believe giving people control over their data is more important. When you visit Off-Facebook Activity, you’ll see the websites and apps that you use regularly, but you might also see some services that you don’t recognize. For example, a website you didn’t visit could show up because a friend looked it up on your phone. Or because you share a home computer with your partner and kids. To help answer common questions people might have, we have additional information in our Help Center. How We Built This and What’s Next Since Off-Facebook Activity is a new kind of tool, there was no template for us to follow. Our engineering teams redesigned our systems and built a new way for them to process information. We also conducted months of research to get input from people, privacy advocates, policymakers, advertisers and industry groups. We made important changes in response to what we learned. For example, several months into our product development, people asked for a way to disconnect future online activity from individual businesses — not just all at once. We also heard from privacy experts that it was important to be able to reconnect a specific app or website while keeping other future activity turned off. We decided to build these options so people could have a better product, even though it delayed our rollout. “As part of Unilever’s Responsibility Framework, we are committed to creating a better digital ecosystem working with our partners. The Off-Facebook Activity tool aims to provide people with greater transparency and control over their own data, helping to improve their online experience. We support this step from Facebook and encourage them and all industry players to continue in the journey to build back trust in the advertising ecosystem.” — Luis Di Como, EVP Global Media, Unilever This feature marks a new level of transparency and control, and we’ll keep improving. We welcome conversations with privacy experts, policymakers and other companies about how to continue building tools like this."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/groups-privacy-settings/","date":"2019-08-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Making Groups Privacy Settings Easier to Understand","text":"By Jordan Davis, Product Manager for Facebook Groups As Mark Zuckerberg laid out earlier this year, social networks can serve as the digital equivalent of a town square or a living room. We know people have needs for both public spaces where you can share with a wide audience and private ones where you can share more intimately. For Facebook Groups, people have historically been able to choose between being public, closed or secret settings for their group. To better match people’s expectations and help provide more clarity, we’re rolling out a new simplified privacy model for Groups — public and private. We’re making this change because we’ve heard from people that they want more clarity about the privacy settings for their groups. Having two privacy settings — public and private — will help make it clearer about who can find the group and see the members and posts that are part of it. We’ve also heard that most people prefer to use the terms “public” and “private” to describe the privacy settings of groups they belong to. Over the last year, we worked closely with global privacy experts and advocates who are working to raise awareness of how to better manage your information online. These experts provided us with key insights to help ensure that these new privacy settings are clearer and simpler to use. Our Community Standards and proactive detection technology will continue to apply across private and public groups, just as they did for the previous privacy settings of public, closed and secret groups. This allows us to find and remove bad actors and bad content, helping keep Facebook safe for everyone. New Groups Privacy Settings With two clear options, this new privacy model is much more intuitive. Public groups allow anyone to see who’s in the group and everything that’s shared there. With private groups, only members can see who else is in the group and what they’ve posted. We also heard that people wanted more control over how their groups can be discovered. So now admins will be able to clearly choose whether or not the group can be found in search and other places. By separating the privacy settings for posts and group membership from the overall discoverability of the group, it is easier for admins to understand and manage their group privacy settings, and also easier for members to know important information like who can find the group. By default, a group that was formerly “secret” will now be “private” and “hidden.” A group that was formerly “closed” will now be “private” and “visible.” Groups that are “public” will remain “public” and “visible.” Admins can find the new controls in their Group Settings. Just as it is today, there are restrictions to if and when an admin can change the privacy setting of a group. Group members are always notified when an admin updates the group’s privacy setting. Safety We’re committed to ensuring that people have a safe experience on Facebook. Over the last few years, we’ve invested heavily in people and technology, hiring more than 30,000 people across our safety and security teams. Within this, a specialized team has been working on the Safe Communities Initiative, with the goal of protecting people using Facebook Groups from harm. Much of the work they do is around proactively identifying and removing posts and groups that break our rules, across both private and public groups. Increasingly, we can use AI and machine learning to proactively detect bad content before anyone reports it, and sometimes before people even see it. As content is flagged by our systems or reported by people, trained reviewers consider context and determine whether the content violates our Community Standards. We then use these examples to train our technology to get better at finding and removing similar content. We’ve written more about how we enforce our policies in private groups here. Resources When people are part of a group on Facebook, it’s important that they know who can see their information and the content they choose to share with their community.

You can also find more details about the new group privacy settings in our Help Center."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/private-groups-safety/","date":"2019-08-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Hard Questions","Public Policy","Safety & Expression"],"title":"How Do We Help Keep Private Groups Safe?","text":"By Tom Alison, VP of Engineering Private groups can be important places for people to come together and share around a range of personal topics, like identifying as LGBTQ or discussing challenges around a rare health condition. But being in a private group doesn’t mean that your actions should go unchecked. We have a responsibility to keep Facebook safe, which is why our Community Standards apply across Facebook, including in private groups. To enforce these policies, we use a combination of people and technology — content reviewers and proactive detection. Over the last few years, we’ve invested heavily in both, including hiring more than 30,000 people across our safety and security teams. Within this, a specialized team has been working on the Safe Communities Initiative: an effort that started two years ago with the goal of protecting people using Facebook Groups from harm. Made up of product managers, engineers, machine learning experts and content reviewers, this team works to anticipate the potential ways people can do harm in groups and develops solutions to minimize and prevent it. As the head of Facebook Groups, I want to explain how we’re making private groups safer by focusing on three key areas: proactive detection, tools for admins, and transparency and control for members. Using Proactive Detection To Moderate Groups One of the main ways we keep people safe is proactively identifying and removing posts and groups that break our rules. This is a main area of focus for the Safe Communities Initiative, and it runs across private and public groups. Increasingly, we can use AI and machine learning to proactively detect bad content before anyone reports it, and sometimes before people even see it. As content is flagged by our systems or reported by people, trained reviewers consider context and determine whether the content violates our Community Standards. We then use these examples to train our technology to get better at finding and removing similar content. Just as we used proactive detection in public, closed and secret groups before, this process will continue to apply to all public and private groups under our new simplified privacy model. Deciding whether an entire group should stay up or come down is nuanced. If an individual post breaks our Community Standards, it comes down, but with dozens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of different members and posts, at what point should a whole group be deemed unacceptable for Facebook? One big factor we look at is subject matter: Does the name or description of the group include hate speech or other content that we don’t allow? Another important factor is the action of admins and moderators, since they set the tone for the group. In April, we updated our policy to look more closely at admin and moderator behavior. If group leaders often break our rules, or if they commonly approve posts from other members who break our rules, those are clear strikes against the overall group. And if a group member repeatedly violates our standards, we’ll start requiring admins to review their posts before anyone else can see them. Then if an admin approves a post that breaks our rules, it will count against the whole group. These, combined with a number of other factors, help us determine whether the group should be taken down. If the group doesn’t cross this line, it will stay up, but we’ll continue to remove individual posts that go against our Community Standards. Tools for Admins Admins know their communities best, and we want to empower them to run meaningful groups. That’s why we built Group Quality, which gives admins an overview of content Facebook has removed and flagged to them for most Community Standards violations. We also added a section about false news found in the group. These tools give admins more clarity about how and when we enforce our policies in their groups and gives them greater visibility into what is happening in their communities. This also means that they’re more accountable for what happens under their watch. We help admins to establish positive group norms by adding a section for rules so they can be clear about what is and isn’t allowed. Admins and moderators also have the option to share which rule a member broke when declining a pending post, removing a comment or muting a member. Transparency and Control for Members We’re also committed to giving group members more transparency and control. When someone joins a group, they should know what type of community they will be a part of. That’s why before joining a group, we let people see relevant details about it, like who the admins and moderators are, and whether the group has gone by any other names in the past. You can also preview a group you were invited to and have the option to accept or decline the invitation. Through the Safe Communities Initiative, we’ll continue to ensure that Facebook Groups can be places of support and connection, not hate or harm. There’s always more to do, and we’ll keep improving our technology, tools and policies to help keep people safe."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/07/soy-super-papa/","date":"2019-07-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Community Voices: Soy Super Papá","text":"When Sergio Alejandro Rosario found out he was going to become a father, he turned to Facebook to create a community for Spanish-speaking dads, Soy Super Papá."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/07/understand-why-youre-seeing-ads/","date":"2019-07-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Understand Why You’re Seeing Certain Ads and How You Can Adjust Your Ad Experience","text":"By Sreethu Thulasi, Product Manager Whether you’re new to Facebook or have been using it for years, you should be able to easily understand and adjust how your information influences the ads you see. That’s why we introduced tools like “Why am I seeing this ad?” and Ad Preferences over four years ago — to provide greater transparency and control. We made updates to these tools recently, but we heard feedback from people that they can still be hard to understand and difficult to navigate. Today we’re making two additional changes to address those concerns. First, we’ll show people more reasons why they’re seeing an ad on Facebook. In the past, “Why am I seeing this ad?” highlighted one or two of the most relevant reasons, such as demographic information or that you may have visited a website. Now, you’ll see more detailed targeting, including the interests or categories that matched you with a specific ad. It will also be clearer where that information came from (e.g. the website you may have visited or Page you may have liked), and we’ll highlight controls you can use to easily adjust your experience. We’re also updating Ad Preferences to show you more about businesses that upload lists with your information, such as an email address or phone number. You’ll now see a tab with two sections: Advertisers who uploaded a list with your information and advertised to it. This section includes advertisers that uploaded a list with your information and used that list to run at least one ad in the past seven days. For example, a fitness studio that uploaded a list of client emails and used that for advertising could show up in this section. Businesses who uploaded and shared a list with your information. This section aims to help you understand the third parties and businesses who have uploaded and shared lists with your information. In this section, you’ll see the business that initially uploaded a list, along with any advertiser who used that list to serve you an ad within the last 90 days. We’re continuing to work to make ads more transparent and easier for you to control. To learn more about “Why am I seeing this ad?” visit our Help Center.

But in order to help people get accurate health information and the support they need, it’s imperative that we minimize health content that is sensational or misleading. In our ongoing efforts to improve the quality of information in News Feed, we consider ranking changes based on how they affect people, publishers and our community as a whole. We know that people don’t like posts that are sensational or spammy, and misleading health content is particularly bad for our community. So, last month we made two ranking updates to reduce (1) posts with exaggerated or sensational health claims and (2) posts attempting to sell products or services based on health-related claims. For the first update, we consider if a post about health exaggerates or misleads — for example, making a sensational claim about a miracle cure. For the second update, we consider if a post promotes a product or service based on a health-related claim — for example, promoting a medication or pill claiming to help you lose weight. We handled this in a similar way to how we’ve previously reduced low-quality content like clickbait: by identifying phrases that were commonly used in these posts to predict which posts might include sensational health claims or promotion of products with health-related claims, and then showing these lower in News Feed. We’ll continue working to minimize low-quality health content on Facebook. Will This Impact My Page? We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed as a result of this update. Posts with sensational health claims or solicitation using health-related claims will have reduced distribution. Pages should avoid posts about health that exaggerate or mislead people and posts that try to sell products using health-related claims. If a Page stops posting this content, their posts will no longer be affected by this change."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/06/making-public-comments-more-meaningful/","date":"2019-06-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","News Feed FYI","Product News"],"title":"Making Public Comments More Meaningful","text":"By Justine Shen, Product Manager We’re always working to ensure that people’s time on Facebook is well spent. One way we do this is through ranking, which promotes meaningful conversations by showing people the posts and comments most relevant to them. Today we’re making an update to improve comment ranking on public posts, and we want to explain how this works and how Pages and people can control their own comment ranking settings. How We Rank Public Comments In addition to ranking posts in people’s News Feed, we rank comments on public posts from Pages and people with a lot of followers, since these posts tend to have many comments. In order to show people relevant and quality comments, we incorporate a number of signals, including: Integrity signals: We want people to see safe and authentic comments. If a comment violates our Community Standards, we remove it. We also take into account other signals, like engagement-bait, to address the integrity of information and improve the quality of comments people see. What people tell us they want to see in comments: We’ve been using more surveys to help us understand the types of comments people want to see, so we can rank those higher. How people interact with comments: This includes signals including whether people like, react to, or reply to a comment. What the poster controls: People can moderate the comments on their post by hiding, deleting, or engaging with comments. Ranking is on by default for Pages and people with a a lot of followers, but Pages and people with a lot of followers can choose to turn off comment ranking. People who don’t have as many followers will not have comment ranking turned on automatically since there are less comments overall, but any person can decide to enable comment ranking by going to their settings. (See more details here.) Always Improving Comment Ranking To improve relevance and quality, we’ll start showing comments on public posts more prominently when: The comments have interactions from the Page or person who originally posted; or The comments or reactions are from friends of the person who posted. We will continue to take other signals into account so we do not prominently show low-quality comments, even if they are from the person who made the original post or their friends."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/06/catching-up-with-facebook-watch/","date":"2019-06-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Catching Up With Facebook Watch","text":"By Paresh Rajwat, Director, Product Management, and Matthew Henick, Head of Content Planning and Strategy Facebook Watch is built on the notion that watching videos can help you connect more deeply with people, instead of being a passive or solitary experience. You have virtually unlimited ways — comments, shares, reactions, polls, Groups, messages, Watch Parties, and more — to connect with people around the videos you love. We launched Watch globally less than a year ago, and there are now more than 720 million people monthly and 140 million people daily who spend at least one minute in Watch. On average, daily visitors spend more than 26 minutes in Watch every day. Building Watch for Social Video Watch isn’t just a place to find videos and shows you love — it’s a place where you can explore and engage with other people who love them, too. These connections let people experience content in a whole new way, and we are focused on making Watch even more social. We recently launched an easy way to find groups based on the videos you’re watching, right from Watch. For example, if you’re watching an episode of Red Table Talk in Watch, you’ll see the official group alongside the video, so you can join if you’d like to talk with other fans — or even the hosts themselves. We’re also testing new sections in Watch — like a way to find videos that are popular with friends, and a section dedicated to co-watching experiences like Watch Party, Premieres, and Live videos — to make it easier to connect with others around videos. We know that people like watching videos together with friends: we’ve found that people are 8X more likely to comment on videos in Watch Party than when watching on their own. Something For Everyone In Watch In order to make Watch the best place for people to enjoy videos together, we need to combine our range of social features with content that sparks people’s interests. Our goal with Watch is to offer a completely personalized experience for everyone, supported by a deep library of videos from a wide array of video creators and publishers. An Ad-Supported Ecosystem The best way to bring great content to Watch is to create a sustainable, ad-supported ecosystem where every publisher and creator can reach their audience, make money from their videos, and thrive on the platform. Ad breaks are available in more than 40 countries, and we continue to expand to more countries and languages around the world. Today we’re launching ad breaks in Canada, and over the coming weeks we will be adding support for five more languages: Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Swedish and Telugu. Along with global expansion, the number of Pages actively using ad breaks has more than tripled over the past year — and the number of Pages earning over $1,000 in payouts per month has increased by more than 8X, while the number of Pages earning over $10,000 in payouts per month has increased by more than 3X. Jay Shetty, a creator who makes inspirational videos on topics like relationships, self-love and purpose, and Mexican Survival Guide, creators of the popular and fun series about Mexican culture, found that creating longer videos that meet the three-minute ad break guidelines helped them earn more revenue to support their passions and expand their storytelling. And BuzzFeed and Group Nine Media are some of the publishers finding success with ad breaks, increasing their use across their Pages and leveraging tools like automatic ad placement to earn money for their engaging and creative videos. Content Investments We are also continuing our strategy of investing in a range of content that encourages conversations and connections. In addition to our Facebook Watch Originals, we are partnering with publishers and creators around the world so that they can bring timely, relevant and entertaining videos to Facebook Watch. Here’s a snapshot of what’s coming: Global Partnerships: We’re partnering with global publishers in entertainment, and sports to deliver a wide range of content that people want to talk about and form friendships around. ProSiebenSat.1 in Germany will bring a huge breadth of digital-first content to Watch — pre-shows, after-shows, interviews, and spin-offs — spanning their popular shows such as The Voice of Germany, Germany’s Next Top Model– by Heidi Klum, and Late Night Berlin. The International Cricket Council will make match previews, highlights, and insider commentary from every ICC Cricket World Cup match available in Watch. In Australia, Seven Studios will launch a slate of new original digital series — and Australian sporting codes NRL, AFL and Cricket Australia will showcase a range of sports content spanning match highlights, live original programs, wrap-ups, and more. And we’ll expand our News in Watch program internationally later this year. Facebook Watch Originals: Our Originals will continue to deliver immersive, social experiences with new seasons of fan-favorites and series debuts. Our adaptation of the iconic MTV’s The Real World premieres tomorrow in the US, Mexico and Thailand, and many other Originals are premiering this summer and fall — July: Human Discoveries (Premiere); August: Ball in the Family (Season 5), Curse of Akakor (Premiere), Five Points (Season 2), Huda Boss (Season 2); October: The Birch (Premiere), Limetown (Premiere), Sorry For Your Loss (Season 2). See our Media blog post for more details. Creator and Digital Publisher Collaborations: In March, we launched a program that connects creators with digital publishers, resulting in the creation of brand-new shows to debut on Facebook Watch. A number of these shows will be available in the coming months, including: Tastemade’s Sundays at Nonna’s featuring Ian Hecox (June), Whistle’s Globetrotter Gauntlet with the Harlem Globetrotters (June), The Players’ Tribune’s Generations featuring Megan Rapinoe and Lindsey Horan (June), Studio71’s Fetch Me A Date starring Jonathan Bennett and Dorothy Wang (July), and Buzzfeed’s Mi Quinceañera Come True featuring PeroLike (October). Looking Forward To The Future There’s always a lot happening with Watch, from amazing new videos that spark conversations, to creators and publishers that inspire fans. We’re committed to making Watch the best place for everyone around the world to discover and watch videos together."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/06/us-blood-donations/","date":"2019-06-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Helping Increase Blood Donations in the US","text":"Update on June 11, 2020 at 12:01AM PT: COVID-19 has led to blood shortages around the world. To help, we’re expanding our Blood Donations feature on Facebook to connect more people to their local blood banks, so they know when there is a shortage and where it is safe to donate. Now, the Blood Donations feature is available in South Africa, Senegal, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Egypt as well as the US, India, Brazil, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Since we launched the Blood Donations feature in 2017, over 70 million people have signed up to be blood donors on Facebook. And in a pilot program in Pakistan, the Ministry of Health reported that three out five blood banks found more than half of their blood donors through Facebook. You can learn more about how this feature helps blood banks and hospitals here. We’re also working with partners in India and Brazil to connect people with more local blood banks and hospitals through the Blood Donations feature. And in the US, we’re excited to announce a new partnership with AABB to connect people to hospital blood banks. Originally Published on June 12, 2019 at 4:00AM PT: Every two seconds, someone in the US needs blood, and one donation can potentially save three lives. However, blood banks in the US are seeing a decline in blood donors. To help raise awareness and make it easier for people to find opportunities to donate, we’re launching our Blood Donations feature in the US today. We’ll start in Chicago, New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Baltimore and Washington, DC, and will roll out nationwide over the coming months. To start, we’re working with partners including America’s Blood Centers, the American Red Cross, Inova, New York Blood Center, Rock River Valley Blood Center, Stanford Blood Center, Versiti, and Vitalant. “Tens of thousands of blood donors are needed each day across the US to transform the lives of patients requiring blood transfusions,” said Mitzy Edgecomb, vice president of marketing and communications at Vitalant. “Summer and winter are notoriously difficult times for collecting enough blood donations, but the need does not stop and can even rise due to increased travel, activity, adverse weather events and cold and flu season among other factors.” Blood Donations on Facebook Since 2017, Facebook has partnered with blood donation centers around the world to help increase the number of donors. More than 35 million people have signed up to be blood donors on Facebook in Bangladesh, Brazil, India and Pakistan where this feature is available. Blood donation centers in India and Brazil found that 20% of people said that Facebook influenced their decision to donate blood, according to in-person surveys conducted at partner blood banks. “Through our partnership with Facebook, individuals will be able to conveniently find and connect with their local blood center to help meet the ongoing need for a diverse pool of blood donors in the US and share their experiences and the importance of blood donation,” said Kate Fry, chief executive officer at America’s Blood Centers. “By encouraging blood donation as a way of life, each of us can assure that the more than 30,000 pints of blood used daily throughout the country is available.” How It Works Starting today, people can sign up to be a blood donor on Facebook by going to Blood Donations in the About section of their profile. When blood donation centers need donors, they can request donations and send notifications to those nearby who have signed up. People will be able to see requests and opportunities to donate on Blood Donations on Facebook. World Blood Donor Day June 14 marks World Blood Donor Day, a day founded by the World Health Organization to thank blood donors for donating and to raise awareness of the need for regular blood donations to ensure communities everywhere have access to safe blood. To commemorate the day, we’re hosting blood drives in some of our offices and running awareness campaigns in Brazil and India. To help draw attention to the fact that there are not enough blood donors nationwide, we’re partnering on the Missing Types campaign with the American Red Cross and Vitalant. We’ll post information on several of our channels to engage our community and drive awareness about the need for blood donors. Facebook is partnering on the Missing Types campaign to highlight the importance of donating blood and reinforce the need for donors nationwide. “We are grateful to Facebook for supporting the Missing Types campaign, which underscores the critical need for blood donors,” said Cliff Numark, senior vice president, American Red Cross. “This campaign comes at exactly the right time, as busy summer schedules make it extremely challenging to sign up sufficient blood donors. And Facebook’s new blood donation feature makes it even easier to make a lifesaving donation.” We hope that bringing the Blood Donations feature to the US will make people more aware of the ongoing need for donations and that communities come together to help ensure everyone has access to safe blood when they need it."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/more-personalized-experiences/","date":"2019-05-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Using Surveys to Make News Feed More Personal","text":"Update on July 2, 2020 at 9:00AM PT: Reducing Bad Experiences by Responding to People’s Feedback Just like we use surveys to show people more content they want to see, we’re now using surveys and other signals to reduce the likelihood that people see content they don’t want to see. We survey people about various types of content and look at actions people take on Facebook, such as hiding or reporting posts, to predict which pieces of content they’re unlikely to want to see. What may be OK to one person could be seen by others as inappropriate. This update means that people should start to see less content they may find inappropriate or that isn’t to their taste across both News Feed and Facebook Stories. Of course, content that violates our Community Standards is never allowed on Facebook — and this doesn’t change that. Understanding feedback allows us to make adjustments that better connect people to what matters most to them on Facebook. Update on August 5, 2019 at 4:15PM PT: Better Connecting You With the Posts You Care About In May, we began using surveys to show people links that are worth their time. We will now extend that to photos and videos as well. Update on May 31, 2019 at 10AM PT: Better Connecting You With the Pages and Groups You Care About We know that friends are not the only reason people come to Facebook. Many people come to see the latest from the Pages they follow and the groups they are a part of. In addition to surveying people asking them which friends they were closest to, we started two additional surveys asking people 1) how interested they are in content from a specific Page they follow, and 2) how important a specific group they’ve joined is to them. Using these survey results, we have updated our algorithm to prioritize the Pages and groups we predict an individual may care about most. Some of the indicators of how meaningful a Page or group is might include how long someone has followed a Page or been a part of a group; how often someone engages with a Page or group; and how often a Page or group posts. Similar to the close friends update we announced earlier this month, these specific changes will not result in an increase of Page or group content. Rather, they will prioritize content from the Pages and groups we think you care about most so that you see them higher in News Feed. Originally Published on May 16, 2019: The goal of News Feed is to connect people with the posts they find most relevant. As we’ve said in the past, it’s not about the amount of time someone spends on Facebook, but rather the quality of time spent. That means making sure people see what they want to see – whether that’s posts from family and friends or news articles and videos from Pages they follow. To do this, we try to understand what people are already doing on Facebook — what they like, comment on and share. We also use surveys to get more context about the posts people want to see and who they want to see them from. Today, we are announcing two ranking updates based on surveys we’ve conducted: one prioritizes the friends someone might want to hear from most and the other prioritizes the links a person might consider most worthwhile. Better Connecting You With the People You Care About We’ve historically predicted who people might want to hear from based on signals like how often they interact with a given friend, how many mutual friends they have and whether they mark someone as a close friend. Now, in addition to understanding these signals, we’ve begun surveying people on Facebook to ask them to list the friends they are closest to. We look at the patterns that emerge from the results, some of which include being tagged in the same photos, continuously reacting and commenting on the same posts and checking-in at the same places — and then use these patterns to inform our algorithm. This direct feedback helps us better predict which friends people may want to hear from most. This doesn’t mean News Feed will be limited to posts from only certain people and it doesn’t mean you will necessarily see more friend content. Rather, you will likely see posts from those you have close relationships with higher up in your News Feed. We also know that whomever you want to hear from right now may not be who you want to hear from in a year, or even a few months. Our prediction models are continuously updated based on the interactions people have with their friends on Facebook. We will also continue to survey people to make sure we understand how new actions and interests map to the friends you want to hear from most. Better Connecting You With the Posts You Care About Last month we explained that as a part of our continued effort to show people relevant posts, we were surveying people to ask what posts they thought were worth their time. Based on these surveys, we are updating News Feed to show people links we predict they will find worthwhile. Similar to the above update, we use these responses to identify signs that someone might find a link worth their time. We then combine these factors with information we have about the post, including the type of post, who it’s from and the engagement it’s received, to more accurately predict whether people are likely to find a link valuable. How Will This Impact My Page? These changes aren’t meant to show more or less from Pages or friends. Rather, the Page links that are surfaced to people will be ones they find worth their time — and the friend posts will be from friends people want to hear from most."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/birthday-stories/","date":"2019-05-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Facebook Stories Sweetens Birthdays With a New Feature","text":"By Jehan Damji, Product Manager People have always come to Facebook to connect with friends and celebrate important moments, like birthdays.

We want to help media companies — whether large, small, global, or local — continue their invaluable work. And above all, we want to help people on Facebook discover great videos and build relationships with the creators and publishers that matter to them. To do this, we’re introducing a series of ranking updates over the coming months that will further prioritize original videos that people seek out. These updates are outlined below, and Understanding Video Distribution on Facebook includes tips on how creators and publishers can find the most success with their videos. (Updated on May 7, 2019 at 9AM PT with correct resource name.) What Are the Changes? We are sharing an update on three factors that impact video ranking on Facebook: 1) loyalty and intent, 2) video and viewing durations and 3) originality. These are not new principles, but we will be strengthening their influence among the multiple factors that determine video distribution. The changes will affect video distribution across Facebook, including News Feed, Facebook Watch and our “More Videos” recommendations. Loyalty and intent: Intent and repeat viewership are important factors we consider when surfacing videos to people in News Feed. Going forward, we will add more weight in ranking to videos that people seek out and return to week after week. Video and viewing duration: As we’ve shared in the past, it’s important to ensure that videos capture viewers’ attention for at least one minute. We will add more weight in ranking to videos that keep people engaged, especially on videos that are at least three minutes long. Originality: Last year we announced that we would limit distribution for unoriginal or repurposed content from other sources with limited or immaterial added value — as well as demote video content from Pages that are involved in sharing schemes. We will more strongly limit distribution and monetization for this kind of content. (See here for more details.) While there are numerous factors that determine video distribution on Facebook, these changes will benefit video distribution for Pages that create original content people want to watch and come back to. We’ll continue to improve video ranking to show videos that people value and to help great video makers reach more people on Facebook."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/04/people-publishers-the-community/","date":"2019-04-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"People, Publishers, the Community","text":"Since 2016, we have used a strategy called “remove, reduce, and inform” to manage problematic content on Facebook.

Our “reduce” work on Facebook is largely centered on News Feed and how we rank posts within it. When developing new “reduce” initiatives, we think about our goals in terms of the needs of three parties: people, publishers, and our community.

People have told us they don’t like content that is spammy, so in recent years, we’ve reduced low-quality content such as clickbait, engagement bait, and web pages with little substance and disruptive ads. We will continue this work in many ways — in some cases we’ll take direct action against new types of content that people alert us to, such as web pages that have broken links, load slowly, or are otherwise difficult to use. In other cases, we’ll use signals, like whether a domain’s Facebook traffic is highly disproportionate to their place in the web graph, to better target known types of low-quality content. Creating more personalized experiences. We’re taking more steps to make sure people see what’s most important to them in News Feed. One of the ways we’ll understand this is by surveying some people on whether posts they see are worth their time. The answers will help us understand who wants to see more, or less, of different types of content. We’re also making it easier for people to customize their News Feed by providing even more ways for them to set preferences. Showing comments that add the most value. People have told us they want to have better conversations on Facebook. Last year, we worked to reduce bullying and offensive comments on public Pages, so that people felt more comfortable engaging with those they don’t know. This year, we’ll continue with those efforts while exploring ways to understand and promote the best comments. Incentivizing Publishers to Invest in High-Quality Content We recognize that getting broad distribution in News Feed influences what publishers produce, and ultimately, what our community sees. We want people to have interesting, new material to engage with in the long term, so we’re working to set incentives that encourage the creation of these types of content. Cracking down on unoriginality. Some publishers gain distribution by publishing content that is repurposed from other sources without adding material value. We began reducing the distribution of unoriginal content last October, and we are continuing to take action against it in a number of ways, including demonetizing it on Instant Articles and reducing the distribution of video content that is compiled and posted from third-party content creators. Doubling down on penalties for repeat offenders. When publishers repeatedly post content that triggers our quality demotions, we expect them to change their behavior. If they don’t, we implement stricter demotions for a set period of time to prompt faster, more comprehensive action. We will continue to introduce penalties for “repeat offenders” along with new quality demotions, to encourage publishers to be compliant with our standards. Fostering a Safe Community There is some content that individual people might want to see, and that don’t necessarily create bad incentives for publishers, but we have decided are problematic for our community. We’ll make this content difficult to encounter for people who aren’t actively trying to see it. Reducing the spread of misinformation. In recent years, we’ve focused on combating misinformation through a combination of technology and human review. This year, we will explore new ways to leverage experts, as well as our Facebook community, in our fight against false news so we can expand the scale and speed of our work. We’ll particularly focus on combating misinformation in high-risk areas like health and finance. Understanding borderline content: Some types of content, although they do not violate the letter of our Community Standards, are sensationalist or provocative and bring down the overall quality of discourse on our platform. As we said back in November, we’re working to understand this type of content. As we deliver on these and other plans, we’ll continue to rely on our core values to keep the central experience of News Feed intact as it evolves.

We know the loss of a friend or family member can be devastating — and we want Facebook to be a place where people can support each other while honoring the memory of their loved ones. Today we’re sharing updates to make this experience even more supportive for our community: a new tributes section for memorialized accounts; additional controls for people who manage memorialized accounts; and improved AI to keep the profile of a deceased loved one from appearing in painful ways. These changes are the result of feedback we heard from people of different religions and cultural backgrounds as well as experts and academics. We’re grateful to them for helping us understand how we can build more tools to help people find comfort in times of grief. Introducing a New Tributes Section Over 30 million people view memorialized profiles every month to post stories, commemorate milestones and remember those who have passed away. The new tributes section expands on this, creating a separate tab on memorialized profiles where friends and family can share posts — all while preserving the original timeline of their loved one. This lets people see the types of posts that are most helpful to them as they grieve and remember their loved ones. Additional Controls for Legacy Contacts In 2015 we introduced a feature that lets people choose a legacy contact — a family member or friend entrusted to care for their Facebook account when they pass away. Since then, we’ve heard that legacy contacts wish they could do more to manage the memorialized accounts they look after. Legacy contacts can now moderate the posts shared to the new tributes section by changing tagging settings, removing tags and editing who can post and see posts. This helps them manage content that might be hard for friends and family to see if they’re not ready. These new controls build on features we’ve had in place for years, like the ability to update the person’s profile picture and cover photo, and to pin a post to the top of their profile (often used for things like information about memorial services). While minors can’t select legacy contacts, we recently changed our policies to let parents who have lost children under 18 to request to become their legacy contact. We made this change based on feedback we received, and we hope it will provide some assistance to grieving parents. Memorialization and AI In addition to creating supportive tools, we also hope to minimize experiences that might be painful. We’ve heard from people that memorializing a profile can feel like a big step that not everyone is immediately ready to take. That’s why it’s so important that those closest to the deceased person can decide when to take that step. Now we are only allowing friends and family members to request to have an account memorialized. If an account hasn’t yet been memorialized, we use AI to help keep it from showing up in places that might cause distress, like recommending that person be invited to events or sending a birthday reminder to their friends. We’re working to get better and faster at this. (Updated on April 9, 2019 at 9:50AM PT to clarify that we use AI this way before an account has been memorialized.) We’ll continue to build on these changes as we hear more feedback. We hope Facebook remains a place where the memory and spirit of our loved ones can be celebrated and live on."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/inside-feed-why-am-i-seeing-this-post/","date":"2019-03-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Product News"],"title":"More Clarity, More Control","text":"News Feed is always personalized to you — and starting today you’ll have even more information and control over your experience.

We Have an Answer for You","text":"By Ramya Sethuraman, Product Manager News Feed is always personalized to you — and starting today you’ll have even more information and control over your experience. We’re introducing “Why am I seeing this post?” to help you better understand and more easily control what you see from friends, Pages and Groups in your News Feed. This is the first time that we’ve built information on how ranking works directly into the app. We’re also making improvements to “Why am I seeing this ad?” a tool we launched back in 2014. We’ve received valuable feedback over the years that has helped us expand the information we share with people about the ads they see. This means you’ll be able to tap on posts and ads in News Feed, get context on why they’re appearing, and take action to further personalize what you see. Helping You Understand and Control the Posts You See The goal of News Feed is to show people the posts that are most relevant to them. “Why am I seeing this post?”, which can be found in the drop down menu in the right hand corner of a post, explains how your past interactions impact the ranking of posts in your News Feed. Specifically, you’ll be able to see: Why you’re seeing a certain post in your News Feed — for example, if the post is from a friend you made, a Group you joined, or a Page you followed. What information generally has the largest influence over the order of posts, including: (a) how often you interact with posts from people, Pages or Groups; (b) how often you interact with a specific type of post, for example, videos, photos or links; and (c) the popularity of the posts shared by the people, Pages and Groups you follow. Shortcuts to controls, such as See First, Unfollow, News Feed Preferences and Privacy Shortcuts, to help you personalize your News Feed. During our research on “Why am I seeing this post?”, people told us that transparency into News Feed algorithms wasn’t enough without corresponding controls. People wanted to be able to take action, so we’ve made it easy to manage what you see in News Feed right from this feature. People’s feedback also helped us determine what specific information would be most valuable to highlight. For example, we’ve included examples of people’s interactions that contribute to each of the three signal categories we show in the feature. Over time, we’ll continue to get feedback on “Why am I seeing this post?” and make improvements. Giving You More Context on Your Ads We’re also making updates to “Why am I seeing this ad?”. Since we launched this feature more than four years ago, you’ve been able to see how factors like basic demographic details, interests and website visits contribute to the ads in your News Feed. Now we’ll include additional details about the ads you see when information on an advertiser’s list matches your Facebook profile. Businesses can reach their customers by uploading information they already have, such as emails or phone numbers. We then try to match the ad to the most relevant audience without revealing any identifiable information back to the business. “Why am I seeing this ad?” will now provide details such as when the advertiser uploaded the information or if the advertiser worked with another marketing partner to run the ad. An Ongoing Commitment Both of these updates are part of our ongoing investment in giving people more context and control across Facebook. We will continue to listen to your feedback and evolve these features over time.

Building Community Through Content: Red Table Talk & More Facebook Watch is the place where community, conversation and content come together. We’re investing in content that sparks conversations and interactions, whether that’s with your friends, other fans or even the stars of the show. Today we’re excited to announce that we will be bringing more than 20 new episodes of Red Table Talk to fans, starting this May. As we shared in December, Original shows on Watch should strike a chord in the broader cultural zeitgeist or serve a group of people with something they can’t get elsewhere. The women of Red Table Talk — Jada Pinkett Smith, her daughter Willow, and mother Adrienne — have done that through their candid conversations about things like addiction, loss, domestic violence, race relations and more, sharing their truths and involving their audience along the way. This culminated with the recent episode featuring Jordyn Woods, which broke records as the most-viewed Facebook Original episode in the first 24 hours — 7.5 million people watched for more than one minute on that first day, with more than 800,000 interactions (likes, comments, reactions, shares) in just the first 72 hours. We’re also happy to welcome another member of the Smith family to Facebook Watch: last month, Will Smith’s Bucket List premiered as one of the biggest debuts for an Original series. Other recent updates to our slate of Originals include the upcoming SKAM Austin Season 2 and community voting elements for MTV’s The Real World, debuting on Facebook Watch this spring with simultaneous seasons from the US, Thailand and Mexico. New Watch Party Test Watch Party lets people watch videos on Facebook together in real time, and since launching globally last year, we’ve seen more than 12 million Watch Parties in Groups alone. And Watch Parties garner 8X more comments than regular videos in Groups. We know people love to start and join Watch Parties around videos on Facebook, but we think there’s an opportunity for Watch Parties to help people connect with each other around content that is not on Facebook, too. We’re introducing a new Watch Party experience that will enable people to host Watch Parties around what’s happening on live TV. People already come to Facebook to talk about exciting events and TV moments — now they’ll have a better way to do this together in real time. To start, we’ll test this globally in Facebook Groups during live sports events like UEFA Champions League soccer matches, giving sports fans the chance to cheer, debate and commiserate on Facebook while watching their favorite match-ups. Here’s how it works: When you start a Watch Party, you’ll see a new option called “on TV,” where you can select the live game. From there, the Watch Party will feature the live game score as you discuss and react in real time alongside other fans. We’ll also be testing interactive tools within these Watch Parties to make the experience even more dynamic — like the ability for hosts to add trivia questions about player stats, or fun facts, and live polls around which team will win. While we’re testing this initially with sports, we can’t wait to bring it to all kinds of live events and cultural moments, from awards shows to highly anticipated show premieres and more. More Places and Ways to Share Music When it comes to people sharing their own videos on Facebook, there are a different set of features we need to provide — and music is central to many personal moments. We’ve been partnering with the global music community to make it possible for people to include music in their videos on Facebook, and today people in more than 40 countries can share personal videos with music. This includes India and Thailand, the newest additions to this list that we’re announcing today. Our aim is to connect people with the music and artists they love. We’ve started by helping people find new ways to express themselves and connect with artists and other fans through features like Lip Sync Live, music stickers in Stories on Facebook and Instagram and the ability for people to add songs to their Facebook Profile. And today, we’re introducing a new feature: from a song on your profile, we’re making it possible to tap through to Spotify — so people can listen to the full song and discover more from that artist. We’ll be adding other partners in the near future as well. This is just the beginning — we can’t wait to build more ways for people to express themselves with music on Facebook."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/02/creating-a-sisterhood-of-truckers-on-facebook/","date":"2019-02-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Creating a Sisterhood of Truckers on Facebook","text":"Sharae Moore is a truck driver who has made it her goal to advocate for other women in the industry.

Android offers a single on/off switch for Location Services, so you can decide whether to share your precise location with Facebook and other apps. But iOS offers an additional option, so you can share your precise location always, only when the app is in use, or never. As a result, one of the questions we often hear from people using Facebook for Android – but not those using iOS – is whether Facebook gets their location even when they’re not using the app. Today we’re announcing an update to Facebook’s location controls on Android to give people more choice over how we collect location information and how we store it. We’re not making any changes to the choices you’ve previously made nor are we collecting any new information as a result of this update. New Location Control and Checkup on Android Today we’re introducing a new background location control on Facebook for Android so people can choose if they want us to collect location information when they’re not using the app. For example, when people choose to use Nearby Friends, a feature that lets friends share their locations with each other, they give Facebook permission to access their location even when they’re not using the app. Until today, people using these features were asked to enable Location History. If you enabled this setting, two things happened: you would share your location when you weren’t using the app and you would allow Facebook to store a history of your precise locations. With this update, you’ll have a dedicated way to choose whether or not to share your location when you aren’t using the app. For people who previously chose to turn their Location History setting “on,” the new background location setting is “on.” For people who had turned Location History “off” – or never turned it on in the first place – the new background location setting is “off.” We’re alerting everyone using the Facebook app on an Android device who chose to turn on Location History in the past, letting them know about the new control, and asking them to take a moment to check that their settings are right for them. If you’ve never turned on Location History, you don’t have to do anything. We won’t turn either of these settings on unless you specifically tell us to. New Checkup on iOS For people who use Facebook for iOS, nothing is changing. But we will send a similar alert to everyone who chose to turn on Location History in the past so they can check to make sure their settings are right for them. More Information About Android and iOS Settings Today, the Location Services setting that iOS provides gives you three choices for when an app can access your precise location: Never: Your app can’t access your precise location While Using: Your app can access your precise location while you’re using the app Always: Your app can access your precise location even when you’re not using the app Today, Android’s Location Services setting gives you two choices on whether an app can access your precise location: Off: Your app can’t access your precise location On: Your app can access your precise location at any time About Facebook and Location Location information makes it possible for people to use Facebook to plan events, see more relevant ads, mark themselves safe in a crisis and share their favorite places. It also helps us recognize if your account has been compromised. For instance, if you usually log in to your account from a browser in London but suddenly someone tries to log in from a browser in Sydney, our systems recognize this unusual behavior and send you an alert to check that it’s really you. You can learn more about the types of location information we collect – in addition to the precise location information that Android and iOS settings control – in Privacy Basics. We’re also updating Access Your Information to include our estimate of your primary location at the city or postal code level. Primary location is determined by information we use to support Facebook Products, such as the current city you might have entered on your profile; the IP address of your device; your activity on Facebook Products (like check ins); and precise location information if you’ve chosen to share it. We hope people find these updates helpful and we’ll continue finding ways to improve our controls based on feedback."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/02/inside-feed-facebook-26-friends-algorithm-myth/","date":"2019-02-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed"],"title":"No, Your News Feed Is Not Limited to Posts From 26 Friends","text":"Copy-and-paste memes — those blocks of text posted on message boards, forwarded in emails and shared via social media — are as old as the internet. A recent example started popping up in late 2017 and continues to see the occasional bump in shares. This meme claims that Facebook’s “new algorithm” is limiting the number of people whose posts show up in your News Feed, usually pegging the number at just 25 or 26 people. Readers are directed to comment on the post, which will supposedly “bypass the system” so that their posts show up in the future, and then copy and paste the text on their own Feeds. Here’s one example of the meme, debunked by the Washington Post: How to avoid hearing from the same 26 FB friends and nobody else: Here is a post explaining why we don’t see all posts from our friends…. News feed recently shows only posts from the same few people, about 25, repeatedly the same, because facebook has a new algorithm. Their system chooses the people to read Your post. However, I would like to choose for myself, Therefore, I ask you a favor: if you read this message leave me a quick comment, a “hello”, a sticker, whatever you want, so you will appear in my news feed. Don’t just “Like”, Facebook requires a “Comment”. Even one word! Thanks!!! Otherwise Facebook chooses who to show me and instead I don’t need facebook to choose my friends! Do not hesitate to copy and paste on your wall so you can have more interaction with all your contacts and bypass the system. That’s why we don’t see all posts from our friends! Though multiple publications have debunked this meme, it continues to persist. So, to clear things up: No, Facebook does not set a limit on the number of people whose posts are shown in your News Feed. “The idea that News Feed only shows you posts from a set number of friends is a myth,” says Ramya Sethuraman, a product manager who works on ranking. “The goal of News Feed is to show you the posts that matter to you so that you have an enjoyable experience. If we somehow blocked you from seeing content from everyone but a small set of your friends, odds are you wouldn’t return.” However, the persistence of the “26 friends” myth is understandable. That’s because the posts in your News Feed are ranked in the order we believe you’ll be most interested in seeing them. (You can learn more about ranking in this short video.) The News Feed algorithms prioritize posts that are predicted to spark conversations among people, whether because of format — for example, live videos tend to lead to more discussions than regular videos — or because the posts were shared by people, groups or Pages you interact with frequently. Because of this, it’s possible that you’ll see content from a similar list of posters at the top of your News Feed, which can make the “26 friends” idea seem plausible. If you scroll down, though, you’re likely to see posts from an even wider group of people. Similarly, while leaving a single comment on a post won’t suddenly “unblock” you from showing up in your friends’ Feed (because there’s no arbitrary limit in the first place), there’s a grain of truth here, too. If you frequently trade comments with a friend, their posts are likely to be shown higher in your News Feed than posts from someone you never interact with. If you want to control what you see in your News Feed, there are more straightforward ways to do it than by sharing memes. Because we know we don’t always get it right, we’ve built and are continuing to build new controls so that people can directly tell us what they want to prioritize, take a break from or get rid of. If you want to make sure you see everything from a certain person, you can use the See First feature to put that person’s posts at the top of your Feed. If you’ve heard too much from someone, you can Unfollow them. If you just want to take a break from someone, the Snooze feature removes them from your News Feed for 30 days."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/12/facebook-watch-what-weve-built-whats-ahead/","date":"2018-12-12T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Facebook Watch: What We’ve Built and What’s Ahead","text":"By Fidji Simo, Head of Video 2018 was a big year for Facebook Watch. Watch launched to every country around the world, the platform opened to videos from all Pages, and we debuted dozens of Facebook Originals. Amazing new content on Watch really got people talking — from Jada Pinkett Smith’s breakout talk show Red Table Talk, to the critically acclaimed dramas Sorry For Your Loss starring Elizabeth Olsen and Sacred Lies from showrunner Raelle Tucker, to live LaLiga football matches in the Indian subcontinent. We also kick-started our slate of global shows with our first interactive game show Confetti expanding to six new markets this year and MTV’s The Real World arriving next year in the US, Mexico, and Thailand. And creators around the world, like Nas Daily, Jay Shetty, and Laura Clery, are thriving on the platform with their unique brands of humor, insight, and creativity. Three months since our global launch, there are already more than 400 million people monthly and 75 million people daily who spend at least one minute on Watch — and on average, these 75 million daily visitors spend more than 20 minutes in Watch. We’re seeing that people are regularly coming back to catch up on the videos they care about and watching for longer periods of time. In this post, we’re sharing more details on our video strategy and a range of new updates for Watch. Building Watch for Conversations, Community & Connections We know that people have a range of video offerings available to them, but Watch is more than just library of videos — it’s a place where people can follow video creators they care about, start conversations about videos with friends, and build communities of fans who share their interests. Watching video has always been a social experience, but as people increasingly watch video online, it has become more solitary. With Facebook Watch, we set out to demonstrate what it looks like to build deep bonds through watching online video, instead of just having a passive viewing experience. The ability to connect more deeply around content is what sets the video experience on Facebook apart. We learned with Facebook Live how powerful it is when people can connect with each other around videos in real time, and we’ve been building new video formats and features that capture the togetherness of Live. Since the Summer we have been working to bring Watch Party to everyone on Facebook. We’ve seen it really take off — there have been more than 12 million Watch Parties in Groups alone, and Watch Parties garner eight times more comments than regular videos in Groups. People can start their own Watch Parties with friends, and we’re also seeing Watch Parties from all kinds of creators and publishers – from Italian creator Benedetta Rossi who hosts Watch Parties for her recipe videos, to Shaquille O’Neal‘s recent Watch Party for favorite episodes of his Facebook Watch show, Big Chicken Shaq. We launched Premieres, letting creators, publishers, and people watch new videos together with other fans. And we’ve introduced polling and gamification tools, giving video creators the power to create fun, unique, and interactive content for their fans. In the coming months, we’re focused on bringing more of these social experiences to Watch, making it easier to find and watch videos together with friends. We’re also working to unify the video experience across Facebook. Right now, people can find videos on Facebook in a number of different places — Watch, News Feed, Search, Pages and more — and all of these can feel different. We want to make the experience of watching video feel immersive no matter where you discovered it. As part of this effort, we’ll be testing a few things in the coming months, like creating a darker background whenever you immerse yourself into a video on mobile, unifying these different viewing experiences under one. And today we’re sharing that people can now find Watch on more surfaces. In August, we rolled out Watch globally on mobile, and from today, Watch is now available around the world on desktop and on Facebook Lite. Creating More Opportunities for Our Partners Since the beginning, we’ve been focused on making Watch a place where all creators and publishers can find an audience and build a community of passionate fans — and importantly, earn money for their work. We know that building a sustainable ecosystem for video creators is the best way to bring great content to the platform, and this was our goal with opening Watch to all Pages and rolling out Ad Breaks. Our initial launch of Ad Breaks was to five countries in August, and we have been focused on rolling out the product over the past few months. Today we are announcing that Ad Breaks are now available to eligible Pages in 40 countries around the world. In 2019, we will continue to expand the ways publishers and creators can make money on Facebook. We’ll bring Ad Breaks to video creators in more countries around the world, and will test new Ad Breaks placements, like in livestreams from gaming creators. We want to bring Brand Collabs Manager to more countries to help match brands and creators for sponsorship deals, and will be expanding our fan subscriptions test. We’re also exploring new opportunities for advertisers. In September, we introduced In-Stream Reserve for premium online video and TV buyers to deliver their ads alongside the highest-quality Watch content, and next year we will continue to provide advertisers with more options to tailor their video ad campaigns and connect with their target audience. In all this, we’ve learned that for monetization products to work, they must balance the unique needs of video creators, people, and advertisers, providing value for all parties. Next year we will continue focusing on enhancing these tools to enable publishers and creators to generate meaningful revenue from their engaged, loyal audiences on Facebook. Investing in Original Content that Sparks Conversations Since launch, we’ve funded a range of Facebook Originals on Watch, and many have found their fit with strong, engaged audiences. With Originals, we’ve intentionally focused on content with the potential to have an extended life on Facebook beyond the initial airing of the shows, that really sparks conversations and two-way interactions. For example, the hosts of Red Table Talk poll their audience for discussion topics for their weekly show, Mike Rowe’s Returning The Favor selects participants for future episodes based on community recommendations, and the Ball In The Family Facebook Group is full of conversation between episodes and seasons. We know that in the age of “peak TV,” simply being entertaining or having high production values isn’t good enough. A show needs to strike a chord in the broader cultural zeitgeist or serve a group of passionate people that want something they can’t get elsewhere. That “something” could come in the form of a personal connection with the talent, or content that covers a niche subject matter. With shows on Facebook, those personal connections are possible, and those fan bases are often already well-formed and reachable on the platform. This is the lens we use when funding original series and the advice we give partners looking to create engaging content. As we move into 2019, we will continue funding Originals, and we’re delighted to announce the renewal of four shows for a second season: Huda Boss, Five Points, Sacred Lies, and Sorry For Your Loss. These shows all cultivated deeply engaged fan bases who came for the episodes, but stayed for the conversations — and are a great example of what can happen when content and community come together seamlessly; you can read more in our Media Blog. As mentioned above, our content strategy goes beyond our Originals — including licensing, partnerships, and more — so that we can test and learn about new video experiences. Above all, our strategy is about identifying the type of content that people want to talk about, and helping people have meaningful connections around that content on Facebook. Looking Ahead Since launch, our aim with Facebook Watch has been to create a destination that people can visit to find the videos that matter to them, the video creators they want to see, and other fans that they can connect with. Everything we do is in service of this, and we’ll continue this mission in 2019."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/12/giving-people-new-ways-to-commemorate-moments-on-facebook/","date":"2018-12-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Giving People New Ways to Commemorate Moments on Facebook","text":"By David Harris, Product Manager Life events on Facebook are a way to share, celebrate and come together around your most important milestones with friends and family.

Life events are a special type of post When we began reimagining life events, we talked to people around the world to understand the milestones in people’s lives, how they share them, and the role they play. We heard that many people want to share and remember major life events, including difficult moments like the loss of a loved one. To help people do this, we’re providing new options, including animated photos and videos. If you don’t have your own images, you can now choose from a wide range of art from Facebook. You can also include photos from the people or Pages you’ve tagged in the post, like your partner in a relationship or a new school or workplace. The photos and videos in your post also include subtle animations, like slowly zooming in. Just as before, when you create a new life event, you can include an icon to represent your update. Come together with your friends and family around your news Another theme we heard in our research was that life events can bring people together. Whether it’s around happy or more solemn occasions, sharing your life event on Facebook is a way to announce your milestone to your friends and family, including people from your past that you want to reconnect or stay close with. Now, for certain types of life events like changes in your current city, work, education, and relationship status, your friends may receive a notification to ensure they don’t miss your news. We filter the notifications so you only see the ones that are most relevant, and you can also turn off these notifications at any time. When you react to a life event, other reactions and photos of friends who have reacted animate to celebrate or commemorate the moment. Life events are highlighted on your Profile Lastly, people told us about how these moments shape who they are and serve as anchor points in their lives. To recognize that, we’re now highlighting life events in a dedicated section on profiles. This can help you learn more about your friends and potential connections — and gives you a new way to reminisce and reflect on your big moments. You can choose to hide a life event by tapping “…” at the top of the post and selecting “Hide from Timeline.” Inspired by you We hope you enjoy the updated, redesigned life events feature, which will be rolling out globally over the coming days on iOS, Android and desktop. Make sure you have the latest version of the Facebook app installed to try it out. We look forward to hearing people’s feedback. In the meantime, here’s a look at some of the ways people use life events:"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/12/facebooks-2018-year-in-review/","date":"2018-12-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Facebook","Product News","Trends"],"title":"Facebook’s 2018 Year In Review","text":"By Sheida Neman, Research Manager Today we are releasing our 2018 Year In Review, highlighting the top ways people around the world connected with their communities on Facebook. First, people made their voices heard about issues that matter to them: International Women’s Day: For the second year in a row, International Women’s Day on March 8 was the #1 most talked about moment of the year. But in 2018, IWD conversation was about more than the day itself. Women and men around the world discussed a wide range of topics, issues and causes related to women. March for Our Lives: Survivors of the violence in Parkland, Florida announced the March for Our Lives movement on February 18, which drove conversation and action around the world. Over the next month, more than 1 million people showed interest in attending a Facebook Event for March for Our Lives, and more than $2.5 million was raised through Facebook Fundraisers. Civic Engagement: The Brazilian Presidential Election on October 7 and the US Midterm Elections on November 6 were top moments for conversation about voting and elections. We also saw communities join together in celebration of global moments in culture: World Cup: More than 383 million soccer fans from around the world took to Facebook to cheer on their favorite teams through 2.3 billion posts, comments, reactions and shares. France’s World Cup victory on July 15 and England’s Semi-Final match against Croatia on July 11 were two of the top most-discussed moments of the year. Super Bowl 52: The Philadelphia Eagles secured their first Super Bowl win against the New England Patriots on February 4. More than 62 million people turned to Facebook following Tom Brady’s incomplete Hail Mary pass at the end of the game, and Justin Timberlake’s halftime performance paying tribute to Prince. The Royal Wedding: The much-anticipated nuptials between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on May 19 connected 42 million people on Facebook who about posted about the ceremony, the newlyweds, and the pomp and circumstance. Finally, people came to Facebook to honor prominent figures who have had a significant impact around the world: Nelson Mandela 100: July 18 marked 100 years since Nelson Mandela was born, and millions of people came to Facebook to celebrate Mandela’s life of dedication to human rights and social justice. Keeping Legacies Alive: The world lost many influential and inspirational people in 2018. From musical icons Aretha Franklin, Avicii, and Dolores O’Riordan of The Cranberries, to scientific visionaries like Stephen Hawking, influential storytellers like Anthony Bourdain and Hollywood stars like Burt Reynolds. People around the world shared millions of posts on Facebook to memorialize the global impact and work of these individuals. Your Year In Review Starting on December 10, you may see a personalized Year in Review video in your News Feed. This video aims to show special moments from 2018 that you’ve shared or been tagged in, and compiles them in a short video that can be edited and shared. See your video at facebook.com/memories. Methodology The top moments of this year’s Year In Review were determined by gathering a list of the top keywords by volume mentioned in a single day on Facebook between January 1 and November 11, 2018. To identify which topics were unique to 2018, we compared these keywords to the previous year’s maximum single-day volume. This means that keywords like Mother’s Day and Halloween, which typically represent the top moments every year, do not repeatedly appear at the top of the list."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/12/facebook-collection-sharing/","date":"2018-12-03T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"A New Way to Share Gift Ideas on Facebook","text":"The holiday season is in full swing, and people are turning to Facebook to find and buy gifts. To help you send gift ideas more easily, we’re introducing the ability for people to share a collection of content saved on Facebook with specific friends and family. We started rolling out the collection feature over a year ago as a way to help you save, easily organize and find posts from a friend or Page you follow, an ad, a Watch video, or Marketplace listing. Millions now use the feature each day, grouping this content into collections like “Living Room Remodel”, “Outfit Inspiration” and “Fitness Favorites.” And we’ve heard from people that they want to be able to share these collections with their Facebook friends. With today’s launch, you can now share a collection so friends can view the content you’ve gathered and add new posts. For example, if you create a collection of products – a holiday wish list of sorts – you can share it with a group of hand-selected family members on Facebook to give them ideas of what gifts you’d love to receive for the holidays. Or if you’re planning a holiday party with friends, you can create a collection called “holiday recipes” and share it with the rest of the group. Those invited can add holiday recipes they’ve discovered on Facebook and save in the shared collection. The possibilities extend beyond the holiday season — the feature can help friends plan a summer vacation, share wedding registry ideas, furnish a new apartment and more. The collection sharing feature will roll out for everyone on Facebook over the next week. Happy sharing and shopping this holiday season!"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/inside-feed-how-search-works/","date":"2018-11-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Product News"],"title":"How Facebook Search Works, in Under Two Minutes","text":"By Yee Lee, Product Manager We’ve explored a variety of hard topics on Inside Feed, such as our fight against false news and how we’re working to prevent election interference. These aren’t the only areas where we want to get to the bottom of how our products work. Search functionality is a key topic of conversation within the tech industry, from questions about how social media sites surface political accounts to potential bias in search results. We want to be more transparent about what happens when you search for content on Facebook. So to help set the stage, we created a video to help the people who use Facebook understand the fundamentals of how it works — most importantly, that while search results are influenced by people’s activity on Facebook, they’re not influenced by searches done off of Facebook. When you search for content on Facebook, the results you see are ranked based on your activity and the activity of the Facebook community. How much each affects the search results you see changes depending on what you search for, which helps make sure the content you see is relevant and useful. Your Facebook activity that may influence your search results includes what your friends share with you, Pages you follow, Groups you’ve joined, events you’ve liked or followed, things you’ve interacted with in your News Feed, information you’ve listed on your profile, places where you’ve been tagged, and previous searches you’ve done. Your Facebook search results are also based on general Facebook community activity, including the popularity of whatever you’re searching for and how recently it was posted. Whatever you search for on the rest of the internet will not influence what you see when you search on Facebook. All content that you see on Facebook is governed by the Facebook Community Standards. These Community Standards are developed by Facebook and the community in partnership with a global team of experts and non-governmental organizations. If you see something that you think may violate our Community Standards, you can always report it to us. These are some of the steps we’re taking to make sure that Facebook is a place of expression and fun while also maintaining a safe environment for everyone.

Originally published on November 28, 2018 at 8:00AM PT: We’re making it easier for people to find news and information from their local towns and cities. Today we’re announcing the expansion of a new local section on Facebook called “Today In” and starting a test for local alerts from relevant government pages. Today In connects people to local news and information about their community. It is now available in over 400 cities in the US, and we have launched our first international test in Australia. In addition, we have started testing Today In in communities located in news deserts, places that have low supply of local news and community information, by supplementing with relevant content from surrounding areas. Earlier this year, we started testing Today In after we did research in which over 50% of people told us they wanted to see more local news and community information on Facebook — more than any other type of content we asked about. The research showed that people wanted both what might be traditionally understood as local news — breaking news or information about past events like city council meetings, crime reports and weather updates — as well as community information that could help them make plans, like bus schedules, road closures and restaurant openings. Today In aggregates local news and community information in a separate section within the Facebook app. People who live in a city where Today In is currently available can visit this section directly, and they can choose to turn on local updates to start seeing a collection of local news more regularly in their News Feed. We’ve seen that people value Today In for helping them stay informed about what’s happening nearby, finding information that directly impacts their day, and discovering ways to support their local community through events or volunteer opportunities. According to one user, Tina, from Peoria, Illinois: “I use [Today in Peoria] every day. That’s the first thing I do in the morning. I work a lot of hours…my phone is always on me, and it’s how I find out about everything going on in town — news, current events, everything. It’s very handy. It’s my go-to for anything and everything.” To learn more about how and why we built Today In, see our Inside Feed story. Local Alerts from Government and First Responder Pages In addition to expanding the availability of Today In, we’re running a test with over 100 local government and first responder Pages to help them communicate time-sensitive and need-to-know information to people on Facebook. People tell us it is important to receive timely, local updates in situations that directly affect them or that require them to take action, such as major road closures, blackouts or natural disasters. The local alert label appears in News Feed and Today In, and we are also testing notifications, which participating Pages can target to people who live in the affected areas. During Hurricane Florence, 17 first responder pages posted 73 local alerts, providing critical updates to people living in the path of the storm. The City of Charlotte Government is one of our first partners to test local alerts: “During Hurricane Florence, we saw the power of the local alerts functionality seconds after applying the tag. Increased engagement, especially shares, with our critical messages played an invaluable role in helping keep our community safe. Being able to reach all of our followers and residents in the immediate area during a crisis or major event is a game changer.” Local government Pages participating in the test can mark their posts as local alerts at their discretion. Pages can post up to 35 local alerts over a rolling 30-day period, and can mark a post as a local alert for up to six hours. This will not affect the ranking of posts in News Feed. Local alerts on Facebook are not meant to replace emergency alert systems. Today In Availability We hope to expand this new section for local news and community information more broadly soon. (Updated on August 13, 2019 at 1:36PM PT to remove link to an outdated map.) If you live in one of the cities where Today In is available, you can find this section in the Facebook app by tapping the menu (☰) and then tapping on “Today In.” You also have the option to change your Today In city. You can also opt in to receive regular updates from Today In, including collections of local news in your News Feed. If you want to receive these updates, visit the Today In section to opt in or tap the “Turn on” button if you see a notice about local updates in your News Feed."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/people-raise-over-1-billion/","date":"2018-11-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"People Raise Over $1 Billion for the Causes They Care About on Facebook","text":"By Naomi Gleit, VP Social Good People around the world use Facebook’s charitable giving tools to support a neighbor who lost everything in a fire, bring critical care to a child battling cancer, help nonprofits bring food to those in need, and so much more. Today we’re announcing that people have raised over $1 billion on Facebook for nonprofit and personal causes, helping to raise awareness and make an impact in their communities around the world. We’re also bringing nonprofit fundraising tools to Canada and Australia. And for Giving Tuesday on November 27, 2018, with our partner PayPal we are matching donations up to a total of $7 million for all US-based nonprofit fundraisers happening on Facebook that day. $1 Billion Raised We are continually inspired by the many ways people support the causes and people that mean a lot to them. Since we introduced charitable giving tools in 2015, people have raised over $1 billion on Facebook through Facebook Fundraisers and Donate Buttons, and over 20 million people have either donated to or started a fundraiser on Facebook. Our nonprofit community also continues to grow, and there are now over 1 million nonprofits in 19 countries that can receive donations directly through Facebook. With fundraisers both big and small, people have made a lasting difference in their communities. Here are examples of some of the incredible impact we’ve seen from Facebook Fundraisers: Save the Children raised more than $7.5 million over the past two years, which contributed to helping 6.5 million children in crisis across 60 countries. 1 in 6 kids in America lives with hunger. No Kid Hungry raised over $5 million from more than 200,000 donors on Facebook to help feed kids across the US. The Marine Mammal Center, the world’s largest marine mammal veterinary hospital, raised over $30,000 to pay for 15 tons of herring – enough to feed all of its seal and sea lion patients for two months. Countless animals suffer from homelessness, abuse and neglect. This year, the ASPCA raised over $4.4 million from nearly 170,000 donors. Stop Soldier Suicide raised over $2 million to help provide 5,000 service members, veterans, or family members with 24 months of personalized support. St. Jude raised almost $30 million, helping to ensure that no family ever receives a bill for treatment, travel, housing or food. International Rescue Committee received over 27,000 donations, enabling them to provide essential support to millions of people whose lives and livelihoods have been shattered by conflict and disaster. Expanding Our Fundraising Tools To help more people support the causes they care about, we are expanding our nonprofit fundraising tools to Canada and Australia, where people can now create fundraisers for over 100,000 Canadian and Australian-based charities, enabled by our partnership with the PayPal Giving Fund. Our nonprofit and personal fundraising tools are now available in 20 countries. $7 Million in Matching for Giving Tuesday 2018 Every year on Giving Tuesday, people come together on Facebook to support and champion the causes they believe in by donating and fundraising. This year, we’ve expanded our partnership and commitment to provide the largest match in the history of Giving Tuesday. With our partner PayPal, we are matching up to a total of $7 million in donations made on Facebook to eligible US nonprofits. Fundraiser and nonprofit matching limits apply — for more details, see here. All donations made to nonprofits through Facebook Payments are 100% free of fees. Also, for the first time, we’re hosting a Giving Tuesday event from our Facebook Page to share updates and fundraiser stories from across the community. Finally, we want to celebrate and express our gratitude to the community of people and organizations who have used our tools to support the causes they care about, making a meaningful and lasting impact in their communities. None of this would be possible without people in our community who passionately support and raise awareness for the causes and people they care about. We can’t wait to see the impact we can continue to make together.

Today we’re sharing updates about new tools and resources to further this commitment, helping people access new career opportunities. We’re launching Learn with Facebook, a career development site that provides an introduction to both the hard and soft skills people need to advance in today’s digital workforce. Learn with Facebook’s lessons include “Ace Your Interview” and “Manage Your Content Marketing” and are free to access. They feature case studies, insider tips and resources from industry experts. To help make Learn With Facebook’s lessons as accessible as possible, we’re partnering with Goodwill Community Foundation to offer this training across the US. We’ll work closely with them to develop training resources for individuals of all backgrounds and education levels. We also know that people need easier ways to find jobs too. In 2017 we launched Jobs on Facebook and to date, our jobs product has helped people find over 1 million jobs. To improve our jobs tool for both people and businesses, in addition to posting jobs to their Page, businesses can now share their jobs in Groups. Today, more than 200 million people on Facebook are members of Groups they consider meaningful, and this update will allow people who may be interested and qualified to better discover open roles. Finally, we’re making updates to our Mentorship tool, which helps connect people in Groups who are seeking mentorship with others in their community who have relevant experience or expertise. Now, we’re making it easier for people in Groups to choose a mentorship partner based on their goals and interests. People can sign up to share information about what they’re offering or looking for, and then others in the Group can browse a list of those available people to find a match and reach out directly. Each week the tool gives pairs helpful prompts to keep the conversation going. As people embark on and continue their career journey, our hope is that these free resources can give them the support they need to advance in today’s digital economy."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/more-ways-to-share-and-connect-with-music-on-facebook/","date":"2018-10-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"More Ways to Share and Connect With Music on Facebook","text":"By Fred Beteille, Head of Product, Music and Rights, and Tamara Hrivnak, Head of Music Business Development and Partnerships Sometimes the right words to fit your mood, feeling, or personality can be hard to find.

We’re launching Music on Facebook Stories, expanding Lip Sync Live, and soon will be making it possible to add songs to your Profile. Launching Music on Facebook Stories Starting today, you’ll be able to add a song to photos and videos you share to Facebook Stories. And, we’re bringing it to News Feed, too! Just take a photo or video from the Facebook Camera or grab one from your camera roll, then tap on the sticker icon and select the music sticker.

Move the sticker around and add other stickers and effects to customize your story. Expanding Lip Sync Live and Adding Lyrics We’ve now rolled out Lip Sync Live to all profiles in many countries around the world. We are also opening up the feature to more artists and creators by expanding to Pages, giving them more ways to connect with their fans. For example, just this week Why Don’t We gave fans an impromptu performance of “8 Letters,” the hit song from their new album, and Jess Glynne used the feature to lip sync live to her new single, “Thursday.” We’ve also heard feedback that people want to see the words to songs while lip syncing, so we’re starting to add lyrics to Lip Sync Live. Lyrics are starting to roll out today, and are available for songs including Dua Lipa’s “New Rules,” Khalid’s “Better,” and “Girls Like You” by Maroon 5. We’ll be adding more soon. Songs on Profile We’ll soon be launching the ability to add songs — what you’re currently listening to, or your all-time-favorites — to a new music section on your profile. You can also pin a song to the top of your profile to share with friends and help them learn more about you. Songs added to your profile will also visually showcase the artist and track you choose. When someone plays a song on your profile, they’ll hear a clip of the song and see an accompanying video featuring photos of the artists and album art. They can then choose to add the song to their own profile or visit the artist’s Facebook Page. Moments are remembered and accentuated with music, and we can’t wait to see all the ways people around the world get creative with these features, make memories, and have fun with friends and family."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/fighting-child-exploitation/","date":"2018-10-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Safety & Expression"],"title":"New Technology to Fight Child Exploitation","text":"By Antigone Davis, Global Head of Safety One of our most important responsibilities is keeping children safe on Facebook. We do not tolerate any behavior or content that exploits them online and we develop safety programs and educational resources with more than 400 organizations around the world to help make the internet a safer place for children. For years our work has included using photo-matching technology to stop people from sharing known child exploitation images, reporting violations to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), requiring children to be at least 13 to use our services, and limiting the people that teens can interact with after they sign up. Today we are sharing some of the work we’ve been doing over the past year to develop new technology in the fight against child exploitation. In addition to photo-matching technology, we’re using artificial intelligence and machine learning to proactively detect child nudity and previously unknown child exploitative content when it’s uploaded. We’re using this and other technology to more quickly identify this content and report it to NCMEC, and also to find accounts that engage in potentially inappropriate interactions with children on Facebook so that we can remove them and prevent additional harm. Our Community Standards ban child exploitation and to avoid even the potential for abuse, we take action on nonsexual content as well, like seemingly benign photos of children in the bath. With this comprehensive approach, in the last quarter alone, we removed 8.7 million pieces of content on Facebook that violated our child nudity or sexual exploitation of children policies, 99% of which was removed before anyone reported it. We also remove accounts that promote this type of content. We have specially trained teams with backgrounds in law enforcement, online safety, analytics, and forensic investigations, which review content and report findings to NCMEC. In turn, NCMEC works with law enforcement agencies around the world to help victims, and we’re helping the organization develop new software to help prioritize the reports it shares with law enforcement in order to address the most serious cases first. We also collaborate with other safety experts, NGOs and companies to disrupt and prevent the sexual exploitation of children across online technologies. For example, we work with the Tech Coalition to eradicate online child exploitation, the Internet Watch Foundation, and the multi-stakeholder WePROTECT Global Alliance to End Child Exploitation Online. And next month, Facebook will join Microsoft and other industry partners to begin building tools for smaller companies to prevent the grooming of children online.

Originally published on October 10, 2018: When Hurricane Florence hit the southeastern coast of the US in September, Anthea Watson Strong was keeping a close eye on the news in Columbia, SC — despite the fact that she lives 700 miles away, in New York City. Columbia is one of over a hundred US cities where Facebook has been testing “Today In,” a section in the mobile app that connects people to local news and information. Watson Strong, a product manager, has been leading this work for the past year and a half. Since the tests began rolling out in January, people in mid-sized cities from Allentown to Yakima have had a dedicated place to see not only articles from local publishers, but also content from less-formal sources of information. People in those cities can also opt into receiving a digest of local updates in their News Feed. During Florence, Watson Strong watched as police departments posted about downed power lines, school districts gave parents up-to-the minute school closure updates and community groups shared tips about which stores still had supplies. “These are the things that really paint a nuanced portrait of a community,” Watson Strong says. “It’s especially apparent during a crisis like Florence, but it’s true during less newsworthy times, as well.” The team was inspired to build the feature after a series of surveys helped outline what kinds of local information people were looking for. The research showed that people wanted both what might be traditionally understood as “local news” — breaking news or information about past events like city council meetings, crime reports and weather updates — as well as community information that could help them make plans, like bus schedules, road closures and restaurant openings. “There was really no place on the Internet collecting information from local publishers as well as less-formal sources of information — parks, libraries, first responders,” says Watson Strong. Content for the section is brought in from all over Facebook. The “In the News” section, for example, identifies local publishers using the same back-end technology that helps prioritize local news in News Feed. To find the relevant Pages for community organizations, like government agencies, art museums and animal shelters, an algorithm looks for “local affinity” — that is, a Page whose fans are geographically located near the organization. All content shown in the “Today In” section gets passed through Facebook’s integrity filters, which helps weed out content that is spammy, contains hate speech, or displays other misleading or inauthentic content. We also wanted to help users more easily see and engage with the local content. In research conducted over the past few years, the majority of people who responded to our surveys said they wanted to see more local news on Facebook. But what was actually preventing them from doing so? First, the team investigated whether there was enough local news being produced in the first place. We researched news deserts, or areas with no local news publishers, and determined that although this would certainly affect some cities, even residents of places with robust news media weren’t seeing as much local information as they wanted. And most local publishers share their articles on Facebook or post to Facebook directly. So the issue didn’t seem to be that there wasn’t enough local content on Facebook — rather, it was more that we needed to make it easier for people to see it on Facebook. Second, the team considered whether there was a better way to connect people to that existing content. We know from our research that people want a more predictable way to find local content on Facebook. Recent ranking changes were making local news more prominent in News Feed, but people wanted a place where they could get all the most important information for their community — and they didn’t want to rely on the serendipity of News Feed to deliver it to them. By building both a dedicated space in the app as well as presenting the option to get a collection of local updates in News Feed itself, the team helped solve the twin problems of discoverability and predictability — that is, how to help people find local news, as well as get it on a regular basis. Finally, the team had to figure out which cities to start testing in. In these early stages, the team has picked cities where there was a continuous stream of fresh content as well as enough people actively using Facebook to ensure that the feature would be valuable. We also looked for cities that were small and densely populated enough for the updates to be relevant to all people within that city. “In a city like New York, people really want information on more of a neighborhood level, not a city level,” Watson Strong says. “If you live in Brooklyn, school closings in Queens probably don’t matter too much to you.” Engagement with the Today In section, as well as the digest in News Feed, has been high thus far, and in recent weeks the Today In feature has expanded from a few dozen to over a hundred cities. “This is a big leap for us in terms of stress-testing the product,” Watson Strong notes. As the team continues to test and refine the product, there are a number of areas we’re excited to continue exploring. For example, we’ve been partnering with over 100 first responder pages in 83 cities and counties, like police departments, fire departments, and city and county governments, to test local alerts, a special, time-bound indicator that can be applied to a Page’s Facebook posts to communicate urgent information. As more government Pages are brought into the local alert program, the Today In section will be a natural place to show these updates, in addition to News Feed and in Facebook’s notifications. Watson Strong is especially excited about the Today In feature’s potential to help build constructive dialogue. Across Facebook, research has shown that local news generally leads to higher levels of “cross-cutting likes” — that is, when people across the ideological spectrum engage on the same piece of content. “Long term, I want it to be a place where people can participate in high-quality public discussions about the issues affecting their neighborhoods,” says Watson Strong. “I want to build the infrastructure that helps people create safe, supportive and inclusive communities.” Want to see if the Today In feature is available in your city? Head to the Facebook app and tap the menu (☰). If it’s in your city, you’ll see “Today In” listed as an option. From there, you can also opt into receiving regular updates in News Feed.

It has grown to be a place where people around the world can discover things they love, connect with people locally, launch a business, and earn a living. Today, more than one in three people on Facebook in the US use Marketplace every month for everything from new shoes to baby gear to cars and apartments. As we celebrate Marketplace’s two-year anniversary, we thought we’d take a moment to share some of the updates we’re making to the product, including new features that use artificial intelligence (AI). Buy and Sell Faster Thanks to AI We believe AI can fundamentally change the way people shop, and are excited about the potential opportunities and value it can bring to buyers and sellers. Behind the scenes AI is making Marketplace more efficient and personalized for buyers, as well as helping sellers connect with more potential buyers, faster. AI can automatically improve the quality of photos and translate listings and Messenger conversations. Today, we’re introducing new features that use AI for price range suggestions and auto-categorization. What does this mean exactly? Here’s an example: if you wanted to sell your home office chair, Marketplace could use AI to help you sell it even faster by suggesting you price it between $50-75 based on what similar chairs recently sold for. It will also automatically categorize the chair as “furniture” based on the photo and description, so that you don’t have to. We’re also testing camera features that could use AI to recommend products you might be interested in. Say you liked your friend’s headphones and wanted your own; you could snap a photo of the headphones and Marketplace’s AI technology could recommend similar listings for sale nearby. In the future, AI could help simplify tasks like completing an outfit or home design project. For example, you could upload a photo of your living room and get suggestions on furniture to buy based on your layout and size. More Shopping Options at Your Fingertips In addition to adding new AI features, we’ve added a variety of content from businesses including cars, home rentals, home services as well as shopping and deals from e-commerce merchants. Today, vehicles is one of the most popular categories for Marketplace globally, alongside furniture and electronics. Since introducing car listings from local dealerships one year ago, Marketplace has become one of the top destinations for people to buy and sell used cars. And I’m one of them. In fact, my family just sold our car to a man who is planning to use it to help grow his small business. Building a Safe, Trusted Community When it comes to shopping online, it’s important to have confidence in the people and businesses you’re buying from. That’s why we’ve invested in features that create a safer and more trusted community, including: Detecting and Removing Inappropriate Content: Thanks to our AI technology, we are working to detect and remove items that violate our policies by analyzing the images, content, and context within a listing. Buyer and Seller Ratings: Buyers and sellers can now rate each other to signal whether they had a good or bad experience, as well as leave feedback on where they can improve such as response time, friendliness and reliability. In addition to helping people make more informed decisions on who to transact with, community ratings help create a better experience by promoting good behavior. More Robust Reporting Tools: Our community helps us make buying and selling better for everyone by reporting content that doesn’t belong on Marketplace. If you see an item for sale that you believe violates our Commerce Policies, you can easily report the listing. You can also report buyers and sellers if you see activity that you think shouldn’t be on Facebook. How to report a listing in Marketplace. We’re continuously exploring ways that could help people make more informed decisions on who to buy and sell with, like badges for buyers and sellers who have confirmed their identity and features that make it easier for sellers to select a nearby public place to meet in person. To learn more about how to buy and sell safely on Marketplace, please visit this link. We’re Just Getting Started Looking back on the past two years, we’re so inspired by people around the world using Marketplace to do amazing things. Stories from people like Ron Rudolph in Minnesota, who bonded with his family and community after losing his wife to cancer by selling birdhouses for a cause. Or Alisa Herrera-Hayman in New Zealand, who uses Marketplace to strive towards a zero-waste lifestyle and help the environment by shopping secondhand. Or the many parents in my local community I’ve connected with who share the same interests as me. We’ll continue working to deliver new product features to discover, buy, and sell the things you love. So whether that’s shopping locally secondhand, finding new items from popular brands, or getting exclusive deals from retailers in time for the holidays, expect to see more from us.

One of the many steps we take to reduce the spread of false news is working with independent, third-party fact-checkers to review and rate the accuracy of content. To date, most of our fact-checking partners have focused on reviewing articles. However, we have also been actively working to build new technology and partnerships so that we can tackle other forms of misinformation. Today, we’re expanding fact-checking for photos and videos to all of our 27 partners in 17 countries around the world (and are regularly on-boarding new fact-checking partners). This will help us identify and take action against more types of misinformation, faster. How does this work? Similar to our work for articles, we have built a machine learning model that uses various engagement signals, including feedback from people on Facebook, to identify potentially false content. We then send those photos and videos to fact-checkers for their review, or fact-checkers can surface content on their own. Many of our third-party fact-checking partners have expertise evaluating photos and videos and are trained in visual verification techniques, such as reverse image searching and analyzing image metadata, like when and where the photo or video was taken. Fact-checkers are able to assess the truth or falsity of a photo or video by combining these skills with other journalistic practices, like using research from experts, academics or government agencies. As we get more ratings from fact-checkers on photos and videos, we will be able to improve the accuracy of our machine learning model. We are also leveraging other technologies to better recognize false or misleading content. For example, we use optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from photos and compare that text to headlines from fact-checkers’ articles. We are also working on new ways to detect if a photo or video has been manipulated. These technologies will help us identify more potentially deceptive photos and videos to send to fact-checkers for manual review. Learn more about how we approach this work in an interview with Tessa Lyons, Product Manager on News Feed. How do we categorize false photos and videos? Based on several months of research and testing with a handful of partners since March, we know that misinformation in photos and videos usually falls into three categories: (1) Manipulated or Fabricated, (2) Out of Context, and (3) Text or Audio Claim. These are the kinds of false photos and videos that we see on Facebook and hope to further reduce with the expansion of photo and video fact-checking. (See more details on these examples from the fact-checkers’ debunking articles: Animal Politico, AFP, France 24, and Boom Live). What’s different about photos and videos? People share millions of photos and videos on Facebook every day. We know that this kind of sharing is particularly compelling because it’s visual. That said, it also creates an easy opportunity for manipulation by bad actors. Based on research with people around the world, we know that false news spreads in many different forms, varying from country to country. For example, in the US, people say they see more misinformation in articles, whereas in Indonesia, people say they see more misleading photos. However, these categories are not distinct. The same hoax can travel across different content types, so it’s important to build defenses against misinformation across articles, as well as photos and videos. What’s next? We know that fighting false news is a long-term commitment as the tactics used by bad actors are always changing. As we take action in the short-term, we’re also continuing to invest in more technology and partnerships so that we can stay ahead of new types of misinformation in the future.

The product team knew that looking at usage patterns would provide an interesting glimpse at the topics the world wanted to hear less about, says product manager Shruthi Muraleedharan. But that data would also provide insights about how people were using the feature, which the team could use to refine the feature itself. To that end, the team analyzed what keywords were snoozed for a two-week period between July 27 and August 9. The sample size was small, given how early the team is in the testing process, and some of the findings remain mysteries to the team. (Why, for example, did more people snooze the phrase “for sale” on July 27 and August 2 than on other days?) However, two trends became apparent. On one hand, there were phrases that maintained a steady amount of snoozes throughout the period. For example, the single most snoozed term on every single day of the analysis was, surprisingly, “copy and paste,” which Muraleedharan believes is an attempt to avoid text posts that implore people to “copy and paste to share” in the hopes of making the message go viral. The other type of snoozing trend involved keywords that saw a pronounced spike — spikes that seemed to be tied to a real-world event. User research by the development team predicted that people would be excited to use Keyword Snooze to keep spoilers off their feeds, and in at least one case, they may have been right: “Love Island,” a hugely popular British romance reality TV show that inspires a ton of online conversation, was one term that saw a spike in the analysis period. Snoozes for the show’s title rose on July 28 and peaked two days later, when the final episode of the season aired. The snoozes were back to pre-spike levels as of August 1, by which point fans had presumably caught up on the grand finale. Some phrases seemed to reflect an uptick in a news cycle. A four-day spike of snoozes of “Husky Dog” that started on August 2 coincided with articles about Aspen, a Husky in Newfoundland that got sick after eating marijuana it found during a walk. (It turns out that dogs are highly sensitive to pot.) The keyword “dogs” had a similar surge during this period. So far, Keyword Snooze has only been rolled out to a portion of users in the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, so the data set isn’t large enough to say anything definitive about people’s preferences. But even this early usage data can help the product development process. For example, having seen that some of the “spiky” usage of the feature, the Snooze team started running a small test with a shorter snooze duration of just 7 days. In the end, all information is valuable information in the team’s quest to help people avoid what they might need a break from. Keyword Snooze is the latest of a series of tools designed to give people more control over their feeds. These include “See First” (to see new posts from a particular person or page at the top of your News Feed), “Hide Post” (to remove this post from your feed and to see fewer similar posts.), “Unfollow” (to stop seeing a person, page or group’s posts but remain friends) and the ability to snooze particular people, pages or groups for 30 days."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/08/inside-feed-motherboard-content-moderation/","date":"2018-08-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Billions of Posts, Hundreds of Languages","text":"Motherboard reporters Jason Koebler and Joseph Cox investigate what goes into moderating user-generated content at a truly global scale, drawing a detailed picture of how content policies are created and then enforced — and the myriad technical and philosophical challenges Facebook faces as it does so.

We launched Watch in the US a year ago to give people a place on Facebook to find shows and video creators they love and to start conversations with friends, other fans, and even creators themselves. Over the past year, we’ve made the experience more social — like making it easier to see which videos your friends have liked or shared, creating shows that have audience participation at their core, and opening Watch to videos from Pages. These updates have helped people discover and engage more deeply with videos they love — from Red Table Talk with Jada Pinkett Smith, to beauty mogul Huda Kattan’s behind-the-scenes show Huda Boss, to live Major League Baseball games. Every month, more than 50 million people in the US come to watch videos for at least a minute in Watch — and total time spent watching videos in Watch has increased by 14X since the start of 2018. As we now make Watch available to everyone around the world, here’s what it has to offer: A place to discover new videos: Find the latest videos spanning entertainment, sports, news and more — all in your personalized Watch feed. A way to catch up with creators and publishers you love: At the top of your Watch feed you’ll see your Watchlist, a collection of recent videos from Pages you follow. Customize this section by following more Pages or removing Pages from your follow list within Watch. A home for your saved videos: If you see a video in News Feed but don’t have time to watch it right away, you can save it to watch later in Watch. Videos you can participate in: We’re building new video experiences that put people at the center, giving them the ability to shape the direction of the content. Over time you’ll be able to find new video experiences in your Watch feed, like Watch Parties, Premieres, and videos focused on audience participation — like the new trivia game show, Confetti. And we’ll make it easier to find live videos so you can discuss the big moments as they’re happening. Taking Watch global also means new opportunities for creators and publishers around the world. We’re expanding our Ad Breaks program so more partners can make money from their videos, and we’re offering new insights, tools and best practices for Pages in Creator Studio. Read more about this on our Media Blog. To access Watch on iOS and Android, look for the Watch icon in your shortcuts bar or the “More” bookmark. You can also find Watch on Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Xbox One, and Oculus TV. We’re excited to bring Watch to everyone around the world, and invite you to join in the action in our new video destination."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/08/inside-feed-voice-posts/","date":"2018-08-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Speaking of Sharing … in India and Indonesia","text":"By Rushabh Doshi, Head of Stories People have been coming to Facebook for more than a decade to stay connected with their friends and family. In that time, we’ve seen a lot of changes in the way people want to share and connect online — from the shift to mobile to the shift to video and recently, the growing popularity of the more in-the-moment stories format. Understanding how people want to connect is a big part of our product development work, which is why we spend a lot of time talking to people who use Facebook. I work on Facebook Stories: collections of photos and videos that are visible for 24 hours. The design of that product has been influenced by people who told us that they wanted a place to share daily, everyday moments. Stories can feel more intimate to people because your friends have to click to see them, and because they kick off conversations in Messenger, where people can have long back-and-forth conversations with one another. But even as we see broader trends in the way people want to share, we know there are likely to be regional differences among our 2 billion users. In this video, research manager Liz Keneski talks about a recent trip she and the Stories team took to India and Indonesia. Hearing people in those countries talk about the unique challenges they face led to the development of a brand-new feature: audio-only voice posts.

People raised more than $300 million for the causes they care about using birthday fundraisers. St. Jude, Alzheimer’s Association, the American Cancer Society, Share Our Strength – No Kid Hungry, and the ASPCA are among the top beneficiaries of birthday fundraisers. Based on feedback from the community, we added new tools to nonprofit fundraisers, like the ability to match donations and add organizers to your fundraiser. Pages – including those run by brands, public figures, and nonprofits themselves – can now create and donate to fundraisers. And we added a tool so people can make recurring monthly donations to the organizations and causes that are important to them. Since November 2017, we waived fees, so 100% of all donations made to nonprofits on Facebook go directly to the nonprofits they are supporting. New Nonprofit Selection Tools Many people have told us that they want to dedicate their birthdays to a good cause. But with over 750,000 nonprofits on Facebook, it can be difficult to choose. To make this easier, we will soon provide more information: when you click on a nonprofit in the list, you can learn more about the organization, their mission, location and how many people like their Page. We also plan to share more relevant information, like popular search terms in the nonprofit selection tool. We hope that this tool will help more people find causes they care about, joining the millions of people who dedicated their birthdays in inspiring ways over the past year, including: Yuriko Shotter, who raised $7,201 on her birthday for 13th Street Cat Rescue to help the cat shelter in her local community build a warmer shelter for cats. Valentine Toohey Smith, who raised $1,914 on her daughter’s 12th birthday for charity: water, an organization whose mission is to bring clean water to people all over the world. Aldo Billingslea, who dedicated his birthday to the Lorraine Hansberry Theatre in San Francisco and raised $7,066 to support local theater and the arts in his community. NBA star Stephen Curry, who celebrated his 30th birthday by raising $82,512 for Nothing But Nets to help combat childhood malaria. And Madonna, who recently launched a fundraiser for her 60th birthday, benefitting Raising Malawi’s work at Home of Hope orphanage located in a rural, high-need area of Malawi.

They use groups to build and foster supportive communities around topics that matter to them. Today, we’re bringing Mentorship to Facebook Groups to make it easier for people who want help achieving their goals to connect with others in their community who have the experience or expertise to help. Last year we piloted Mentorship, and by bringing it to groups, people in existing communities can now connect and get one-on-one support through a guided program. For example, two mothers in Mama Dragons, a group meant to empower and support mothers with LGBTQIA children, are helping each other navigate the journey of raising a transgender child. Also, a woman was paired with a mentor from Soap-making and Business Coaching who has helped her take her love for making soap from a hobby to a business. Mentorship is available to people within select groups focused on parenting, professional and personal development. Here’s how it works: Group admins create a mentorship program. Admins can choose from a variety of template programs, such as career advancement, skill development, or encouragement and support, and select the one that best fits their community’s needs. People sign up and are matched with their mentor/ mentee: Group members can sign up to be a mentor or a mentee, then the group admin will pair people together. Pairs are introduced. Pairs can get to know each other and work through program steps in their one-on-one mentorship program on Facebook. They can share and comment on posts there or communicate through Messenger. Mentors and mentees get step-by-step guidance. The pairs progress through a guided program that encourages them to check in with each other weekly. Mentorship is built with privacy and safety in mind. All communications between a mentor and mentee is visible only to the pair. People can report issues to Facebook, and they have access to the same reporting and blocking features available elsewhere on Facebook. Mentorship is only available to people 18 years and older. Our goal is to build tools that help people get the support they need. We hope that Mentorship makes it easier for people to build relationships that help them reach their goals."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/08/inside-feed-can-breaking-news-break-through-on-facebook/","date":"2018-08-06T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Can Breaking News Break Through on Facebook?","text":"By Alex Hardiman, Head of News Products Update on November 1, 2018 at 1:30 PM PT: Over 250 publishers across the globe now use the breaking news label today, which can be seen by Facebook users in Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France and Germany. Originally published on August 7, 2018: On June 23, 2018, floodwaters suddenly trapped a team of teenage soccer players who’d been exploring a cave complex in Thailand. Over 17 days, the world watched anxiously as rescue teams assembled, divers located the boys, and a two-day operation finally brought them and their coach to safety. The rescue has been one of the biggest news stories of the year, full of drama and tension. It’s also a prime example of the kind of developing news story that News Feed isn’t always well equipped to capture. Posts in News Feed are generally ranked according to their relevancy to each individual, not strictly by chronology or by how any given post relates to the other posts that appear beside it. So when a news story stretches across multiple days and multiple updates, people on Facebook can end up getting that story in scattered, potentially out-of-order bits and pieces. People might see reports on the trapped teens, but then wouldn’t have a way of knowing if those were the latest or most crucial updates. In interviews and surveys, Facebook users in the US reported that the variety and volume of content in News Feed was making it hard for even dedicated news consumers to follow developing news on the platform. Meanwhile, through the Facebook Journalism Project — which brings news organizations and Facebook product teams together to collaborate on product development, among other things — publishers were telling Facebook that they wanted help quickly communicating urgent news stories and using breaking coverage to build more audience loyalty. Brian Kadar, a Facebook engineer who works on news products, sums up the challenge this way: “How do we capture that a story is alive?” For about a year now, Kadar and his colleagues, along with publishers as a part of the Facebook Journalism Project, have been experimenting with ways to do just that. “This is a chart we’ve used to show how we’re thinking about the life cycle of a news story,” he says of the image above. “It’s not a formal roadmap, but it shows how different points along the way present different opportunities for us to help publishers get their journalism in front of their readers as a story unfolds.” The team’s first test, launched in November 2017, is a label that lets publishers mark Instant Articles, links and Facebook Live videos as “breaking.” To preserve its value as an identifier of important stories, each label can last for six hours maximum and publishers are limited to using it once a day (with a few extra each month, for big news days). In June 2018, the team launched its second test, giving news publishers the ability to string together multiple updates on a given news story. Each update appears as a new post in News Feed, but users who choose to follow the overall story — by clicking a button on any of the individual updates — receive a notification whenever new content is shared. That notification links to a page where people can view all of the related updates in chronological order. Test partners used the feature to tell stories across major events like the Mueller investigation, the Capitals winning the Stanley Cup and the Thai cave rescue. To date, more people followed the rescue, via story updates from eight different publishers, than all other topics combined. “It was a tailor-made case for the tool,” says Kadar. “It played out over an extended period of time, and people were really invested in following it through to the end.” Over 100 publishers across the globe use the breaking news label today, which can be seen by Facebook users in Canada and the US and is also being tested in a handful of international markets. Meanwhile, 14 publishers in the US, Australia, Canada, Great Britain and India are participating in the developing news test, and a small subset of Facebook users in those countries can see developing news updates in their News Feed. “This is standard practice for rolling out new Facebook features,” explains product manager Mona Sarantakos. “We test with a small group, learn, adjust; then roll it out to a bigger group, learn, adjust.” In the case of these news product features, the team is also collaborating closely with publishers throughout the development process. “If we see that people and publishers are getting real value out of these features,” says Sarantakos, “we’ll roll the features out even more widely.” Today, along with their publishing partners, Facebook’s team is focusing on refining the designs of the developing news tools, to make it clearer that each update is part of a larger story narrative and encourage them to see Facebook as a place to get a cohesive look at a big news story from publishers they trust. “We want Facebook to be a place where publishers can help people understand the news,” says Kadar, “not just deliver them bits and pieces of it.”"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/08/helping-people-connect-with-local-businesses/","date":"2018-08-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Helping People Connect with Local Businesses","text":"By Alex Himel, VP of Local Over 1.6 billion people around the world are connected to a small business on Facebook. People and businesses alike have told us they want even easier ways to connect, so today we’re: Updating Pages: We’re redesigning Pages on mobile to make it even easier for people to interact with local businesses and find what they need most. For example, you can make a reservation at a restaurant; book an appointment at a salon; or see most recent photos, upcoming Events, and Offers. You can also now see Stories on Pages to get to know the people behind the business. Making Recommendations from your community more helpful: People use Recommendations to ask their communities where to go, where to eat, or where to shop. We’re making those Recommendations more prominent on Pages. Continuing to build Events: 700 million people use Facebook Events each month to find things to do in their communities. This includes organizations like CUESA, a local agricultural nonprofit, that uses Events to connect local farms with shoppers in person. And if you want to get tickets to an event, you can buy them right from the Event on Facebook. Events that sell tickets directly on Facebook have seen two times more people getting tickets than when they’re ticketed on a website alone. Expanding our jobs tool to help more people find work: Local businesses create more than 60% of new jobs. We want to help people find those jobs and help local businesses hire the right people, so we’re expanding our job application tool to everywhere in the world. Taking steps to make finding a local spot quicker: You can now browse a “Local” section in your Facebook app and a standalone Facebook Local app for businesses around you, see what places are most recommended, and check out which events your friends are attending. Local communities are built, grown and sustained by people. People like your neighbors, your friends and your favorite local business owners. On Facebook, there are more than 80 million small businesses using our free business tools. Those tools are helping people and businesses connect like: Courtney and Marc Jackson from Buffalo, New York, who have had a weekly date night at their favorite Mexican place, Lloyd Taco, since it started as a food truck in 2010. The couple follows Lloyd’s Facebook Page for updates about its restaurants, events and specials. They got to know their favorite spot so well, Marc proposed with a Lloyd takeout box, Lloyd catered their rehearsal dinner, and they took wedding photos at the restaurant on their big day where they were met with champagne. “Our love story wouldn’t be what it is without Lloyd, and Facebook is what made getting to know our favorite restaurant so well possible,” Marc said. Sasa Sushi in Tottori, Japan, owner Mieko Inada needed to bring in new customers, so she made a Facebook Page in 2012. “I was a 62-year-old widow with no computer experience when I started using Facebook to connect with our customers,” Mieko said. “I cherish the connections Facebook brings me every day.” More than 50% of Sasa Sushi’s new customers discover it on Facebook. These are more steps we’re taking to make connecting with local businesses easier on Facebook. Because when businesses succeed, communities thrive.

We developed these tools based on collaboration and inspiration from leading mental health experts and organizations, academics, our own extensive research and feedback from our community. We want the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram to be intentional, positive and inspiring. Our hope is that these tools give people more control over the time they spend on our platforms and also foster conversations between parents and teens about the online habits that are right for them. To access the tools, go to the settings page on either app. On Instagram tap “Your Activity,” and on Facebook, tap “Your Time on Facebook.” At the top, you’ll see a dashboard showing your average time for that app on that device. Tap any bar to see your total time for that day. Below the dashboard, you can set a daily reminder to give yourself an alert when you’ve reached the amount of time you want to spend on that app for that day. You can change or cancel the reminder at any time. You can also tap on “Notification Settings” to quickly access the new “Mute Push Notifications” setting. This will limit your Facebook or Instagram notifications for a period of time when you need to focus. We have a responsibility to help people understand how much time they spend on our platforms so they can better manage their experience. In December 2017, we shared insights about what the team at Facebook is doing to create experiences that help people connect and build relationships. Additional Tools Although we have more work to do, over the past year, we’ve introduced a number of tools to help people better control their experience on Facebook and Instagram. On Facebook, we improved News Feed quality to show people the most relevant posts with features like See First, Hide, Unfollow, and Keyword Snooze. On Instagram, we launched powerful tools to proactively care for the community — like the “You’re All Caught Up” message in Feed, keyword filtering, sensitivity screens, and offensive comment and bullying filters. We also have an ongoing, global commitment to suicide prevention, including the expansion of proactive detection and improvement of first responder identification. Our approach was developed in collaboration with mental health organizations such as Save.org and with input from people who have had personal experience thinking about or attempting suicide. Community Outreach In March, we convened our Facebook Safety Summit, with more than 100 organizations, researchers, experts and teens to talk about a wide range of topics — from issues of safety and technology, to how tech is impacting our well-being. We’ve also partnered with Scholastic and Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence to develop and launch “Best Selves” social and emotional learning curriculum designed to give teachers easy to use lessons that help students develop pro-social behaviors; and worked with Stand for Children, Harvard’s Making Caring Common and other experts to develop “kindness” curriculum and launch Kind Schools Challenge which enrolls middle schools in teaching 30 days of kindness curriculum. It’s not just about the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram but how they spend that time. It’s our responsibility to talk openly about how time online impacts people — and we take that responsibility seriously. These new tools are an important first step, and we are committed to continuing our work to foster safe, kind and supportive communities for everyone. These updates are rolling out soon on Facebook and Instagram."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/07/watch-party-launches-around-the-world/","date":"2018-07-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Watch Party Launches Around the World","text":"For the latest information on how to use Watch Party, visit our Help Center. Today, we’re launching Watch Party to all Facebook Groups around the globe. Watch Party is a new way for people to watch videos on Facebook together in real time. Once a Watch Party is started, participants can watch videos, live or recorded, and interact with one another around them in the same moment. We’ve been focused on building new ways to bring people together around video, create connections, and ignite conversations; Watch Party is the next step in bringing this vision to life. We are now starting to test the ability for people to start Watch Parties with friends outside of groups, too, and we’ll explore Watch Parties for Pages in the future. We believe that if people can start a Watch Party directly from their profile or from a video they’re watching, the experience of watching video on Facebook can become even more fun and social. Watch Party in Groups We’ve been encouraged by feedback from groups using Watch Party as we’ve been testing and rolling out. We’ve heard from group leaders that they’re excited to use Watch Party for things like: hosting Q&As around particular hobbies such as cooking or crafting, sharing behind the scenes details of a video, swapping tips and tricks for things like home improvement, decorating, or makeup tutorials with members in real time, learning new things like a workout technique or musical skills, and inviting special guests to join their Watch Party. In our testing, we’ve seen Watch Parties, both big and small, with highly engaged members often generating hundreds or even thousands of comments while watching videos together. There were even groups that dedicated more than 10 hours to a single Watch Party, with different members coming in and out throughout the day. We’ve heard Watch Party can be useful for smaller communities, too. For example, recently a group with fewer than 10 people recently hosted a Watch Party with more than 500 comments. Some describe how this shared viewing experience can be used to bridge distance between close friends and family when they can’t physically be together. Imagine sitting down to watch a loved one’s graduation video with your extended family when they couldn’t be there in person, reliving a vacation by sharing videos and swapping memories, or even just hanging out with friends watching funny videos together. The possibilities are endless. For example: The Dogspotting Society Group has used Watch Party to enjoy funny and heartwarming dog videos together. Big Ballers – The Official Ball in the Family Group hosted a Season 2 Binge Watch Party so fans could catch up and get excited before the new season. They also hosted live Watch Parties from JBA games, giving the group the chance to cheer and discuss together while watching LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball compete in this new league. This spring, royal enthusiast groups around the world hosted Watch Parties to watch and discuss Royal Wedding videos together alongside other passionate fans. KARD, a popular South Korean K-Pop group celebrated their first anniversary by hosting a Watch Party with their fans around the world. They played a teaser clip for their upcoming album and new music video, and also included a Facebook Live broadcast with group members. Fans of Facebook creator Markian have used Watch Party to watch his videos together in the #SmileSquad Group, and Markian even joined one Watch Party to interact with fans directly. FIN, a secret women-only group with more than a million members that describes itself as a “no-judgment support group for women” of African culture, has hosted Watch Parties for members to connect and discuss various topics of interest to the group — from news to comedy. Key Features Based on community feedback from the test, we’re launching with two new features today: First, we’re adding Co-hosting, which lets the host of a Watch Party designate other co-hosts who can add videos and keep the party going. We’re also adding Crowdsourcing, which lets anyone in a Watch Party suggest videos for the host to add to the Watch Party. Weekend of Watch Parties To celebrate this global launch, we’ve lined up a Weekend of Watch Parties, when Facebook Groups around the world will host Watch Parties to connect their communities from July 27 to July 29. Check out a few of the groups who will be participating: Buzzfeed’s Tasty Group is a community of foodies where group members share and discuss favorite recipes and cooking tips. The group will host several Watch Parties over the weekend: Friday’s Watch Party will be determined by polling the group ahead of time, Saturday will focus on cooking tips, and Sunday will consist of recipes to prep for a Sunday dinner with family and friends! Physician Moms Group, a community that brings together women physicians — who are also parents — to collaborate and support each other while sharing their medical expertise, will host a Watch Party with videos around women’s empowerment, motherhood, and medicine-related videos. Outdoor Afro, a leading network and community that celebrates and inspires African American connections and leadership in nature, will host a Watch Party for a video where its Boston Outdoor Afro community tackles Mount Washington’s Tuckerman Ravine. Fitness Sisters, a community built around women supporting and motivating each other on their health and fitness journeys, will host a Watch Party with videos on the process of building healthy fitness friendships. Red Table Talk Group will poll members about their favorite episodes and host a Watch Party this weekend featuring the top three. Fans will be able to re-watch and discuss with each other and may even get a visit from a special guest in the Watch Party. Female Travel Bloggers, a community of like-minded women who write about travel and empower one another through advice and encouragement, will host a Watch Party with videos on travel and women’s empowerment. The Broke Black Girl, a group that gives African American women a safe space to discuss personal finance challenges and find support, will host a Watch Party with videos around current events, women’s empowerment, and financial and career planning. Echte Mamas, a German-based moms’ group discussing real stories, experiences, and anecdotes of motherhood will host a Watch Party centered on sharing tips and advice from other moms around the world. Mama Tribe from Australia is looking forward to hosting Watch Parties to connect mothers in their communities including the Mama Tribe Gold Coast, Brisbane and Central Coast, who come together to develop friendships and share their experience of motherhood and common challenges in real-time. Jamie Oliver’s 5-day Veggie Challenge will host a Watch Party for some of Jamie’s favorite veggie recipe videos — from sweet potato chili to aubergine daal — and will be asked to help select videos they want to see next. Tia Mowry’s Quick Fix Fan Group will host a Watch Party of fan-favorite videos that feature Tia’s home life and family — from a marriage Q&A, to a conversation with Tia’s Dad and brother, and an episode about Tia’s newborn baby girl.

How Fans Came Together to Celebrate on Facebook","text":"By Rujuta Kortikar, Data Science Intern and Nick Blair, Product Producer Billions of people followed the 2018 World Cup, which came to a rousing conclusion on Sunday, July 15. During the tournament, people visited Facebook to cheer, celebrate and go wild for amazing goals. This year, one product team at Facebook decided to to build something fun and new for the world’s soccer fans — and do it at a massive scale. During the tournament, when fans of the English national team typed “Three Lions” into a post or comment, they might have seen England’s team colors shoot across the screen along with an animation of lions, a flag and celebratory streamers. When fans of Nigeria posted the team’s “Up Super Eagle” cheer, they might have seen a stream of green and white alongside an eagle. And no matter what country a fan was cheering for, celebrating a big goal — or GOOOOOOOOOOALLL! — activated a soccer ball rocketing across the screen with fireworks and applause. These kinds of text effects first rolled out on Facebook in 2017, and there are several in rotation today. You won’t find an official list anywhere, though. “We want these features to be fun and unexpected, so we let people discover the effects themselves, rather than talking about them publicly,” says brand marketing manager Colin Murtagh. Now that the World Cup has wrapped and these soccer animations are no longer active, the team can share that more than 583 million tournament-related animations appeared on Facebook this summer. In total, there were 78 phrases that triggered animations: a few celebratory phrases for each of the 32 countries in the tournament and nine language variants of “Goal!” Coming up with the actual country phrases was no easy feat. They needed to be phrases that people would realistically type out in a post or comment, so they had to be brief. That meant some of the longer anthems that soccer fans sing together in stadiums and bars were out. (Sorry Mexico fans, no animations for “Cielito Lindo.”) They also needed to be phrases that, when typed, would reliably be about soccer, so “Aguante Argentina” (or, “Keep it Up, Argentina”) was out, as that could be used in many different contexts. Creative Director Zach Stubenvoll, who oversaw the project, describes the process by saying, “Creatively, we pushed the animations to express each team’s pride and capture some of the excitement of watching a game live in a stadium. We looked at every aspect of the experience — from color, icons, motion and sound design — making sure each was thoughtfully considered and relevant for fans.” During the 2014 World Cup, Facebook noticed that fans were celebrating big goals on the platform in real-time by typing “Goal!” or “Gol!”, but that they weren’t content to use just a single O. To ensure that they could capture the full scope of fans’ enthusiasm, the team designing this year’s animations developed a new method of pattern matching that allowed for any number of G‘s, O‘s, A‘s, and L‘s to activate the animation. In English, “Goal,” “goalll,” “goooooaaaalllll” and “GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL” all resulted in the animation. The team then repeated this process for nine different language variants of “goal.” In 2018, more than 11 million O‘s were used in instances of the English word “goal” on Facebook. But there were more than 85 million O‘s in instances of “gol”, the word in Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. The most exuberant “goal” contained 63,199 characters—or the equivalent of 17 pages of text written in single-spaced 12-point font.

How exactly does Facebook collect and process all that feedback? To find out, we sat down with the people who lead that work: the user research team. “A lot of what user research is trying to do is help the product designers and engineers really understand who they’re building for and what their needs and wants are,” says David Ginsberg. Ginsberg oversees a team of more than 100 researchers that focus on the Facebook app, from News Feed to profiles to the search experience. Many tech companies rely on a range of research methods to learn more about what people want and need from their products, and Facebook is no exception. Some of the methods Ginsberg’s team uses involve talking to small groups of people and are exploratory in nature: Researchers might invite people to sit down for one-on-one interviews, join focus groups or keep diaries about their experiences with the app over time. On the other end of the spectrum, researchers invite large groups of people to take surveys, often via the Facebook app itself — tens of thousands of people opt into taking surveys every week. Using a mix of these methods, product teams can learn a lot about what users care about and why. The more intimate, qualitative methods yield rich, resonant anecdotes that help illustrate the nuances and complexities of people’s feelings about an issue, while broader-reaching quantitative methods, like surveys, help define how particular groups of people feel about different issues and how many people share those attitudes. And with more than 2 billion people using Facebook every month, researchers have to carefully construct their study designs to make sure that they’re hearing from representative swathes of the community, all over the world. User feedback informs all phases of product development. For example, in January, Facebook announced that it would begin to adjust ranking to make News Feed more about supporting more meaningful social interactions on Facebook. That shift was sparked by a number of inputs, from academic research to responses to surveys, run by the News Feed research team, which showed people wanted to see more posts from their friends and family. Since the initial shift in January, the research team has continued to reach out to people through surveys, interviews and diary studies to deepen their understanding of what people consider to be “meaningful” interactions with others. Recently, the team has been looking to understand what types of interactions (likes, comments, re-shares, etc.) are most meaningful to people — and whether it matters how close someone is to the person they’re interacting with. Those learnings go on to influence ongoing updates to ranking, as well as other products. Soliciting feedback from users is actually just one way Facebook brings outside voices into the mix. Researchers as well as Facebook’s partnerships and policy teams regularly talk with experts in civil society, the academy and elsewhere to ensure they’re up-to-date on the latest research and best practices. What people do on the platform is an important, implicit form of feedback that product teams take into account as well. For example, in the early days of Facebook, the only type of photo you could upload was your profile photo. But then the company noticed an intriguing trend: people were constantly switching their profile photos, sometimes as often as once an hour. They realized that people were trying to share more visual moments from their lives and so in 2005, Facebook launched the ability to upload photos, arrange them in albums and tag people. Facebook later became the most popular photo-sharing service in the world. Looking at what people aren’t doing on the platform is a helpful insight, as well: Earlier this year, Facebook removed the Trending news feature because it was getting so little usage. (This is why it’s helpful that Ginsberg and his researchers work closely with the analytics team that analyzes on-platform trends.) With so many different types of feedback coming in, a big part of the research team’s work is understanding how all of those things come together, to best understand what the community is asking for. Lauren Scissors, who leads News Feed research, says that for years, people kept asking Facebook to build a “dislike” button. But when her team dug a little deeper, through interviews and surveys, the “latent desire” they heard from people was that they didn’t feel that the Like button captured the entire range of emotions they wanted to express. That insight led to the 2016 launch of five new Reactions, adding “Love,” “Haha,” “Wow,” “Sad” and “Angry” to the classic thumbs-up “Like.” Ultimately, the desire to express the full range of one’s emotions is a prime example of a “people problem” — a guiding concept that helps make sure teams are building something people will actually use, instead of just something the company wants people to use. “A lot of the things we’re building on Facebook are new ways to help people do things that they have been doing for years — staying connected, sharing about their lives, learning about the world,” Scissors explains. “If we only think about people’s motivations and desires through the lens of Facebook, we’re probably going to miss the deeper or even new ways we can help people connect, share, and learn.” See also: How People Help Fight False News Hard Questions: Is Spending Time on Social Media Bad for Us?

We asked Product Design VP Julie Zhuo to give us an overview of Facebook’s approach to designing controls; hear her response in the video above. As Julie notes in the video, teams have to understand “the moments in which these controls are going to be most useful for people.” Keyword Snooze can be accessed from a post’s upper right-hand menu, so as soon as you stumble on a TV spoiler or a celebratory post for that soccer game you haven’t watched yet, you can take action to avoid those unwanted posts in your News Feed. Whenever Facebook product teams launch a new control, like See First, Hide, Unfollow, or Snooze, they face a crucial design challenge: How to help people tailor their experience without having to wade through complicated settings pages.

To prevent future heartache, we’re beginning to test the next addition to our suite of News Feed controls, Keyword Snooze. Located in a post’s upper right-hand menu in News Feed, the feature gives people the option to temporarily hide posts by keywords, which are pulled directly from text in that post. If you choose to “snooze” a keyword, you won’t see posts in your News Feed containing that exact word or phrase from any person, Page or Group for 30 days. In other words, fewer spoilers. Even though we work to show you the most relevant posts on News Feed, we don’t always get it right. That’s why we’ve designed features like See First, Hide, Unfollow, Snooze, and now, Keyword Snooze.

We know that admins invest their time and energy to maintain their groups, and some have told us that they would like tools to help them continue to invest in their community and offer more to members. Today, we’re piloting subscriptions with a small number of groups to continue to support group admins who lead these communities. We hear from group admins that they’re looking for ways to help them earn money to deepen engagement with their members and continue to support their communities. Many admins do this today by creating an additional subscribers-only group that sits alongside their existing group, and rely on additional tools to track and collect payments. Subscription groups were created to make it easier for admins to provide these experiences with built-in tools, and to save them time so they can focus on offering members-only content. For members, they’re now able to sign-up and manage their subscription through the Facebook app for iOS and Android. Subscription groups align with the experience that we made available to support video creators earlier this year, and is part of our overall approach to helping creators and leaders to financially support the work they do to engage their fans and communities. One such community leader looking to support her work, Sarah Mueller, started a group called Declutter My Home as a way to inspire and motivate others to tidy up their apartment or house. The group quickly became an active community for helping tens of thousands of people across the world to reduce clutter in their spaces. With her new subscription group, Organize My Home, members will be able to work together on bite-sized projects, and have access to easily actionable checklists, tutorials, live videos and more to help with home organization. “Since I started Declutter My Home, it’s been motivating and fulfilling to help others get on the path of clearing their homes of unnecessary clutter, and creating a safe and supportive space for people to come together around this common goal,” said Mueller. “With the new Organize My Home subscription group, I will be able to provide this new community with more interactive ways to having an organized home like mini-projects, group challenges, trainings, and live Q&A, while still keeping the original group as a robust community for getting free advice and motivation.” This subscription groups pilot is testing with a small number of groups across a range of interests who will share input and feedback along the way. They include Grown and Flown Parents: College Admissions and Affordability, a dedicated college preparation group with access to college counselors to help prepare parents of high schoolers for the college application process; and Meal Planning Central Premium, a meal preparation group that includes weekly meal plans, shopping lists by preferred grocery store, and more. As we learn from this pilot and understand how group members feel about subscription groups, we’ll continue to improve this experience to help admins offer more to their members and continue to invest in their communities."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/06/helping-creators-connect-create-and-grow/","date":"2018-06-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Helping Creators Connect, Create and Grow","text":"By Fidji Simo, VP of Product and Sibyl Goldman, Director of Entertainment Partnerships We are committed to helping creators connect with their fans and build their businesses because they have some of the strongest communities and share some of the most engaging and creative content. Creators are vibrant and inspiring, and we want to support them on their journey — whether they’re just getting started or already have millions of fans. Earlier this year, we announced that we would be testing a range of new tools and experiences for the creator community. Today we’re sharing updates on new ways for creators to engage and grow their communities, manage their presence, and build a business on Facebook. Engaging and Growing Creators’ Communities We want to help creators connect with their fans through video — from Live With to Facebook Stories to Watch Party – and today we’re taking the next step. [New today] Making Video More Interactive: We believe that watching video doesn’t have to be passive, and that many types of traditional entertainment formats — from game shows to reality TV to scripted content — can be reinvented to be community-centric. Today we’re sharing the next step for interactive video on Facebook. We’re announcing a set of new tools — polling for Live and on-demand video and gamification for Live — that will give creators the power to create fun, unique, and interactive content for their fans. Read more in our Media Blog post. [New today] Bringing More Videos to Facebook Watch: When we launched Watch, we started with shows, and while they will continue to have a prominent place in Watch, we are now bringing videos from Pages into Watch as well. In our testing, we’ve found that people enjoy discovering and watching a combination of shows and videos in Watch — and for creators, this means their videos may be eligible to show up in Watch to be discovered by a broader audience. Rolling Out Top Fans to More Creators: In March, we started a test that highlights a creator’s top fans by displaying a badge next to their names, enabling creators to easily identify and interact with their most loyal fans. Creators and fans loved the feature, so we are rolling it out more broadly. Managing Creators’ Presence on Facebook We’ve continued to invest in the fundamental tools creators need to manage and control their content on Facebook. We want to ensure it’s easy for creators to manage their presence on Facebook. [New today] Testing a New Video Template for Pages: We are starting to test a new Video template that creators and publishers can use on their existing or new Facebook Page. This template puts video and community front and center on a creator’s Page, with special modules for things like videos and groups. This new template will be easy to try out with one click, or revert back to their original Page template if desired. Creator App for Android Available Globally: Last year we introduced the Facebook for Creators site and Facebook Creator app for iOS, and now the Creator App for Android is available globally. Accepting Applications for Rights Manager for Creators: In March we announced that we were testing a new version of our Rights Manager tool that’s built especially for our creator community, and recently began accepting applications from any creator, helping them control where and how their original content appears. Building a Business on Facebook We want to provide different ways for creators to make money on Facebook, so they can choose what makes sense for their content and community. For example, creators with longer content that fans come back for can monetize effectively through ads. Creators with super-fans or niche content can earn money directly from their audience through fan subscriptions or digital goods. Branded content can work for a range of creators who have audiences that businesses want to reach. Today we’re sharing a few updates on the monetization products we’re building. [New today] Announcing Brand Collabs Manager: We want to help creators be discovered by brands for new branded content collaborations. The Brand Collabs Manager lets brands search and find creators to potentially establish deals and partnerships with. We’ve been testing this with a limited set of partners, and will now be opening up more broadly. Learn more and express interest here. Enabling Ad Breaks for More Creators: Today we’re starting to open up our Ad Breaks program to more creators in the US. We’ll be opening up in stages, starting with creators who are creating longer, original content that brings people back and fosters a loyal community. Expanding Fan Subscriptions: We’ve been testing a way for fans to support creators they love by pledging $4.99 (USD) per month in exchange for perks like exclusive content and a special badge highlighting their status as a supporter, and we are now expanding to more creators. Creators can visit Facebook for Creators to learn more and express interest in these features. All creators using our monetization products must meet our monetization standards and follow our content guidelines for monetization. We’re also launching a limited program called Facebook for Creators Launchpad to help support creators we think fans will seek out in Facebook Watch. The program is by application only; creators in the program will be able to earn money from their videos via Ad Breaks and get support connecting their content to larger audiences. The program will focus on creators with longer, authentic content that brings people back, that are focused on building a loyal community of fans, and who meet our monetization standards and follow our content guidelines for monetization. Creators can apply here. Finally, this week we will also be presenting six sessions at the annual online video conference VidCon, with topics spanning from video to News Feed to monetization. Additionally, for the first time, Facebook will have a booth on the show floor as part of the Community Track. We’ll have special appearances by a range of creators, including Huda Kattan, Laura Clery, Julius Dein, 80Fitz, The Crazy Gorilla, Nala Cat, Doug the Pug, and more. If you’re at VidCon, please come visit us! We’re looking forward to seeing how creators use all these tools to create great experiences for their fans. We encourage creators to join the Facebook for Creators community at facebook.com/creators/join to express their interest in these new tools, stay up-to-date on the latest news, be considered for product testing opportunities, and get notified when new features become available."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/06/making-it-easier-to-donate-blood/","date":"2018-06-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Making it Easier to Donate Blood","text":"By Hema Budaraju, Product Lead, Health Today, in honor of World Blood Donor Day, we are launching Blood Donations on Facebook, a new center where people in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan can find opportunities to donate nearby.

We have also made it easy for organizations to add requests and events to the center. People will be able to access Blood Donations on Facebook from the explore menu on their device. World Blood Donor Day Campaign In many countries, including India, blood donations are typically at their lowest during May and June. To help raise awareness of the shortage and the need for donations, we’ll be running a campaign through the month of June to encourage people to donate blood and educate people about the process of donating blood. The campaign will include stories of people who have helped saved lives using our blood donation features. We’re also partnering with organizations across India, including the National Blood Transfusion Council, a division of India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and Giants Welfare Foundation, to set up over 2,000 blood donation events on Facebook this month. These events will be featured in our new Blood Donation center. We hope that by raising awareness and letting people know where and when they can donate, we can increase blood donations and contribute to a more sustainable blood supply. People in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan can go to facebook.com/blooddonations to learn more and find nearby places to donate blood.

Today, we’re launching Memories, a single place on Facebook to reflect on the moments you’ve shared with family and friends, including posts and photos, friends you’ve made, and major life events. Every day more than 90 million people use On This Day to reminisce about these moments they’ve shared on Facebook, and research suggests this kind of reflection can have a positive impact on people’s mood and overall well-being. This is why we’re updating the experience to ensure all of your memories are easy to find. Your Memories page can include several sections: On This Day: The content that you know and love will still be available within this section, showing your past posts and major life events from this date. Friends Made On This Day: This section will include a list of friends you made on this date in the past, including special videos or collages that celebrate your friendversaries. Recaps of Memories: This section will feature seasonal or monthly recaps of memories that have been bundled into a message or short video. Memories You May Have Missed: If you haven’t checked your memories lately, this section will show you the posts that you might have missed from the past week. We know that memories are deeply personal — and they’re not all positive. We try to listen to feedback and design these features so that they’re thoughtful and offer people the right controls that are easy to access. We work hard to ensure that we treat the content as part of each individual’s personal experience, and are thankful for the input people have shared with us over the past three years. You can still access your memories through the Memories bookmark either to the left of your News Feed on your computer or in the “more” tab on the bottom right of your mobile app. You can also access Memories through notifications, through messages that you may see in your News Feed, and by visiting facebook.com/memories."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/06/level-up-fb-gg/","date":"2018-06-06T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"New Ways for Gaming Creators to Get Started and Get Discovered on Facebook","text":"By John Imah, Gaming Creator Program Lead, and Nick Miller, Product Manager In January we launched our gaming creator program, and since then we’ve seen thousands of people livestreaming and building communities on Facebook around the games they love. Established creators in the program continually share feedback on how we can help new gaming creators be successful. We hear often that emerging creators need help getting started, finding audiences for their content and connecting with fans. So today we’re announcing a new program specifically for emerging gaming creators, as well as an early version of a new place for people to discover and watch gaming video on Facebook. Level Up Program for Emerging Gaming Creators Sample Dashboard for Level Up Members To help gaming creators get started, we’re announcing our Level Up Program for creators who are just beginning to build their communities on Facebook. Available in the coming months, this program will give creators information and tools to jumpstart their communities and earn money for their work. Key elements of the program include: Earning money with Facebook Stars: Level Up members will be able to earn money through the fan support feature that we announced in January. Now called Facebook Stars, that feature lets fans support their favorite gaming creators by purchasing and sending virtual goods during livestreams. Early access to new features for livestreaming: Level Up members will receive early access to new features, best practices from established gaming creators and customized access to Facebook support for troubleshooting and bug reporting. We want to give emerging gaming creators the information and support they need so they can livestream more easily, grow their communities more quickly and focus on making great content. Check out our Gaming Creator portal for more on the Level Up program, including eligibility requirements. We’ll start sending invitations and onboarding Level Up members in waves and plan to open up to gaming creators globally in the next few months. We’re continuing to expand our gaming creator program — creators who are interested in joining can sign up here. Several partnered creators are participating in our test of fan support via monthly payments, and in the coming weeks, we’ll add more partnered creators to that test group. More Ways for Fans to Discover and Follow Gaming Video Gaming Video Destination on Mobile Many people already watch gaming videos in News Feed, Groups and Pages, and we want to do more to help creators get discovered and reach new fans. To make it easier for people to find and follow gaming content, we’ve recently started testing a new gaming video destination on Facebook — available at the short URL fb.gg — that aggregates live and prerecorded gaming video on Facebook in one place. People will be able to discover gaming video on our new destination based on creators and games they follow, Pages they like and Groups they belong to. We’ll also feature creators, esports competitions and content from gaming industry events on fb.gg. To seed the ecosystem, inspire others, and bring great content to fb.gg, we are funding content from creators and esports that will also be aggregated in our gaming video destination. We’re in an experimental phase and will continue to test new experiences, including a feed where fans can explore relevant gaming content, improvements to recommendations, expanded gaming video inventory in more languages and integration of an Instant Games tab on the mobile version of our gaming destination so people can toggle between watching and playing games. Gaming Creators and Facebook Gaming at E3 Facebook Gaming E3 Booth Rendering Next week at E3 in Los Angeles, we’ll showcase what we’re working on as we strive to build the world’s community for gamers. Our booth in South Hall (#2301) will bring all these efforts together under an updated visual brand identity for Facebook Gaming that unites the wide variety of gaming communities on Facebook. We’ll continue to roll out this new look at future events and on additional Facebook gaming channels and platforms. Similar to our recent activation at PAX East, the Facebook Gaming E3 booth will feature creators like MelonieMac, Darkness429, MissesMae and StoneMountain64 alongside developers to talk about their favorite games and mingle with fans in person — and all content will be available on the homepage of our gaming video destination. We’ll also feature some exciting games coming out this year, both playable and featured on stage, including the latest VR titles coming to Oculus Rift.

Today we’re announcing new ways for people to express themselves with music in their posts, including a new feature, Lip Sync Live. SHARE VIDEOS WITH MUSIC ON FACEBOOK From weddings and holidays to everyday celebrations, the special moments in life are often ones we associate with music. Together with the music industry, we are working to enable people around the world to include music in their videos on Facebook, opening up more options for creativity and sharing memories with friends and family. We’re testing this in several markets now and look forward to making it available more broadly soon. LIP SYNC LIVE We’re starting to roll out Lip Sync Live, which lets you lip sync to songs from forever favorites like “Welcome to The Jungle” by Guns N’ Roses to new hits like “Havana” by Camila Cabello. With Lip Sync Live, you can express yourself with music from a variety of genres in real time. So whether you prefer songs like “Happier” by Ed Sheeran or “God’s Plan” by Drake, Lip Sync Live lets you bring friends and family into spontaneous musical moments. To try it out, choose the Lip Sync Live option when starting your Live video. After selecting a song from the song list, you can also add a description and customize your video with masks or a background. When broadcasting with Lip Sync Live, friends will see the artist and song highlighted on the video and can tap to follow the artist on Facebook. STAY “TUNED” FOR MORE We’re exploring more ways to bring music to Facebook. In the coming months, we’ll start testing options for adding the music you love to Facebook Stories.

Expanding to Pages Brands and public figures use their Facebook Pages to connect with followers and fans, and now they can rally support around nonprofits as well. Nonprofits can now also start fundraisers on their Pages for their own causes. We’ve already seen momentum and success from Pages running fundraisers. Artists Tegan and Sara recently launched a Page fundraiser to help send 100 kids to LGBTQ summer camp in the US and Canada through the Tegan and Sara Foundation LGBTQ Camp Scholarship and in collaboration with the Ally Coalition. Adding Organizers Just like you can add a co-admin or moderator to a Facebook Group or a co-host to your Facebook Event, you can now add up to three friends to be organizers of your fundraiser to help you manage it and rally more supporters to reach your fundraising goals.

We introduced Trending in 2014 as a way to help people discover news topics that were popular across the Facebook community. However, it was only available in five countries and accounted for less than 1.5% of clicks to news publishers on average. From research we found that over time people found the product to be less and less useful. We will remove Trending from Facebook next week and we will also remove products and third-party partner integrations that rely on the Trends API. We’ve seen that the way people consume news on Facebook is changing to be primarily on mobile and increasingly through news video. So we’re exploring new ways to help people stay informed about timely, breaking news that matters to them, while making sure the news they see on Facebook is from trustworthy and quality sources. For example: Breaking News Label: A test we’re running with 80 publishers across North America, South America, Europe, India and Australia lets publishers put a “breaking news” indicator on their posts in News Feed. We’re also testing breaking news notifications. Today In: We’re testing a dedicated section on Facebook called Today In that connects people to the latest breaking and important news from local publishers in their city, as well as updates from local officials and organizations. News Video in Watch: We will soon have a dedicated section on Facebook Watch in the US where people can view live coverage, daily news briefings and weekly deep dives that are exclusive to Watch. People tell us they want to stay informed about what is happening around them. We are committed to ensuring the news that people see on Facebook is high quality, and we’re investing in ways to better draw attention to breaking news when it matters most."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/05/pardon-the-interruption/","date":"2018-05-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Pardon the Interruption: It’s About Your Privacy","text":"By Erin Egan, Chief Privacy Officer Starting this week, we’re asking everyone on Facebook to review important information about privacy and how to control their experience.

We aim to respond within one business day. This feature can be found within admin tools, and is currently available to a limited number of group admins on iOS and Android in English and Spanish. Online admin education resources: To help admins learn how to keep their communities safe and engaged, we’ve created an online learning destination. It includes tutorials, product demos, and case studies – all drawn from the experience and expertise of other admins – that can be found on facebook.com/community. New features for group rules: When admins or moderators remove a post that violates the rules of their community, they can now notify the member with details on which group rule they broke. Admins and moderators will also be able to collaborate by adding notes in their admin activity log when they remove a post. Preapproved members: Group admins can spend a lot of time managing their groups, and look for ways to do so more efficiently. Admins and moderators will now be able to select members whose content will automatically be approved every time they post, saving them time to focus on connecting with their members.

Ranking has four elements: the available inventory of stories; the signals, or data points that can inform ranking decisions; the predictions we make, including how likely we think you are to comment on a story, share with a friend, etc; and a relevancy score for each story.

When we detect this kind of content in News Feed, there are three types of actions we take: remove it, reduce its spread or inform people with additional context. Our Community Standards and Ads Policies outline the things not permitted on the platform, like hate speech, fake accounts and terrorist content. When we find things that violate these standards, we remove them. There are other types of problematic content that, although they don’t violate our policies, are still misleading or harmful and that our community has told us they don’t want to see on Facebook — things like clickbait or sensationalism. When we find examples of this kind of content, we reduce its spread in News Feed using ranking and, increasingly, we inform users with additional context so they can decide whether to read, trust, or share it.

A Stanford PhD student in economics, he left academia to help the company design the auction system for its first self-service ads product. Two years ago, after a stint as VP of engineering for ads, he joined the News Feed team. “News Feed is really the core of what Facebook is,” Hegeman says. “It’s why people use Facebook and why they want to come back every day. I was really excited about working on the thing that makes Facebook what it is.” Last week, it was announced that Hegeman would become the new head of News Feed, as long-time leader Adam Mosseri moved to Instagram. We sat down with Hegeman to hear more about his background, how he’s thinking about the challenges ahead, and the unique perspective an economist can bring to News Feed. What were you doing at Facebook before you stepped into this role? For the last couple years, I led the product management function for News Feed. I was responsible for setting the product direction, helping plan out road maps, ensuring there were good milestones and goals for teams. In this new role, I’m responsible for all the different functions that work together to make News Feed great – that includes engineering, design, analytics and more. You started at Facebook in 2007, just after News Feed debuted. How have you seen News Feed change over the years? News Feed was created to help people see what was going on in the lives of their friends and family. Before, if you wanted to see what your friends were up to, you’d have to go to each of their profiles, and maybe some of them would have done something new, some of them wouldn’t. You might miss something. News Feed solved that problem – to ensure that you could go to one place and see all of the most important updates from your friends. That core value proposition has actually remained remarkably constant, even though it’s been a long time and the company, and the people who use Facebook, have grown an enormous amount. The thing that has changed is that there are lots of other things that you can do now. You can read news, you can watch videos, you can join groups or events. There are tons of different things you can do now, even though we know the most important thing that people want to do is understand what’s going on in the lives of their family and friends. What kinds of challenges have come along with that growth? As our platform gets bigger and bigger, there are more incentives for bad actors to try to take advantage of it. Sometimes bad actors try to trick people; sometimes they try to take advantage of the way News Feed works to get more distribution for a piece of content than it really deserves. We have to invest a lot in fighting those types of bad experiences, those bad actors. That’s never something you’re done with. What made that a challenge you wanted to take on personally? Facebook and News Feed are unique, both in the way they help people connect and the way they help people find out what’s going on in the world around them. It’s upsetting when that’s not as great as it could be. We know there are so many ways that the product could be better, and there are still bad experiences that should never happen. And that just matters to so many people in the world. It’s really motivating to get to work on that every day. What are your top three priorities as the new head of News Feed? My biggest priorities right now are continuing some of the themes we’ve been talking about this year. That includes growing the good – helping News Feed do a better job of that core need of connecting people with their closest friends and family. We’ve talked a fair amount about that this year and announced some ranking updates and product work that we think is going to help with that, but there’s a lot more to do there. That’s a big focus. Paired equally with that is fighting the bad. We’ve made a lot of progress in fighting that, but we still have a lot more to do. And third, for me – this is a new role. There’s always a lot to learn, and that’s going to be a fun process that I’m going to focus on, too. How does your background on the ads side of the business impact your work on News Feed? One thing that I think is helpful for me is my background in designing markets and thinking about incentives. That was something that was important on the advertising side, and even though it’s a slightly different setting, it’s also really important in how News Feed works. You need to make sure that the market works both for people who are posting things and trying to reach other people, as well as for the people coming to just consume or read content. Thinking about how that full market works together, and the incentives it creates for both sides, is something I have a fair amount of experience with and am really excited about digging into. What did you learn about incentives that applies to News Feed? One important thing about building markets in general is to not get overly focused on the short term. When you’re building a system – whether that’s our advertising system or News Feed – it’s tempting to see all the different decisions you might make as inherently involving trade-offs: If we show more content from friends, that might mean less stories from Pages. But when you take a longer-term view, the interest of all of these different groups are really aligned. Ultimately, if we don’t make News Feed do the best job of providing people with what they want, then they’re not going to come back to News Feed as much in the future – and those publishers won’t be able to reach the same audience on News Feed. It’s really in everyone’s interest – Facebook’s, people who use Facebook, and publishers as well – that we do a good job of ultimately serving people’s needs and providing the best product. What do you need to be a good leader of News Feed? One, you have to be humble. It’s a complicated enough system that your intuitions are going to be wrong sometimes. The really important thing is that you have some ideas about how things might work, but then you have to gather data and talk to people and figure out what works and what doesn’t. Another thing that’s really important is to be able to think broadly about what a lot of different people want. News Feed is really different for every single person who uses the platform. I can’t just go and look at what my News Feed looks like and figure out whether a change was a better or worse product experience. We have to use a lot of data, we have to talk to people, we have to combine all of those things together to make the experience work."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/05/clear-history-2/","date":"2018-04-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Getting Feedback on New Tools to Protect People’s Privacy","text":"By Erin Egan, VP and Chief Privacy Officer The past several weeks have made clear that people want more information about how Facebook works and the controls they have over their information. And today at F8 we’re sharing some of the first steps we’re taking to better protect people’s privacy. We’re starting with a feature that addresses feedback we’ve heard consistently from people who use Facebook, privacy advocates and regulators: everyone should have more information and control over the data Facebook receives from other websites and apps that use our services. Today, we’re announcing plans to build Clear History. This feature will enable you to see the websites and apps that send us information when you use them, delete this information from your account, and turn off our ability to store it associated with your account going forward. Apps and websites that use features such as the Like button or Facebook Analytics send us information to make their content and ads better. We also use this information to make your experience on Facebook better. If you clear your history or use the new setting, we’ll remove identifying information so a history of the websites and apps you’ve used won’t be associated with your account. We’ll still provide apps and websites with aggregated analytics – for example, we can build reports when we’re sent this information so we can tell developers if their apps are more popular with men or women in a certain age group. We can do this without storing the information in a way that’s associated with your account, and as always, we don’t tell advertisers who you are. It will take a few months to build Clear History. We’ll work with privacy advocates, academics, policymakers and regulators to get their input on our approach, including how we plan to remove identifying information and the rare cases where we need information for security purposes. We’ve already started a series of roundtables in cities around the world, and heard specific demands for controls like these at a session we held at our headquarters two weeks ago. We’re looking forward to doing more."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/04/introducing-new-tools-for-facebook-fundraisers/","date":"2018-04-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Introducing New Tools for Facebook Fundraisers","text":"By Asha Sharma, Head of Product, Social Good Every day, people start Facebook Fundraisers to support the causes that matter to them. Today, we’re announcing new features to make your fundraisers more impactful: People can pledge to match donations to their nonprofit fundraiser. This is a first of its kind tool in online fundraising that’s now available in the US and will soon expand internationally. We’re also announcing new categories for fundraisers for personal causes so people can raise funds for more social good causes across family, faith, travel, and volunteering. In the coming weeks, we’re eliminating the platform fee on all fundraisers for personal causes, helping maximize their support. Matching Donations to Your Nonprofit Fundraiser People often pledge to match donations to their Facebook Fundraisers, and we wanted to make that easier. David Smith lost his sister in a car accident in 2013, and this year for his birthday, he started a fundraiser for Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). He told family and friends that if he could raise $100, he would match their contribution. People rallied around the cause and raised $2,360 — more than 10x his original goal. We want to help everyone to meet and exceed their fundraising goals through matching donations. Now people who create fundraisers can pledge to match donations up to the amount they choose, from $5 to $2,500, helping them build momentum for their cause. More Ways to Make an Impact for Personal Causes People on Facebook have raised money for many personal causes, including loved ones who need critical surgery, teachers needing school supplies for their students, and families in need after losing everything in a fire. We’ve added more categories for fundraisers for personal causes to give people more options to raise critical funds for themselves, a friend, or something or someone not on Facebook. Based on feedback from our community, we’re adding fundraiser categories for family (like adoption or new baby supplies), faith (like missions or religious community events), travel (like educational trips or travel for medical needs), and volunteering (like volunteer programs or supplies) causes. We’ve already seen examples of people using these new categories, like Lauren Pyskoty who started a fundraiser to support her first mission trip and raised $1,328. These are in addition to existing categories for personal fundraisers: community projects/groups, sports/competitions, education, medical, pets/animals, personal emergency, crisis relief, and memorial/loss. We’re inspired by the many ways people have come together to support one another. In the coming weeks, we’re eliminating the platform fee on all fundraisers for personal causes, so that people can maximize their fundraising support. There will still be a small fee charged for payment processing and applicable taxes. To create a fundraiser for a nonprofit or a personal cause, visit facebook.com/fundraisers or tap the Fundraisers bookmark on your Facebook app. You can choose the cause you want to support, share why it’s important to you, and follow the steps to set up your goal.

Unfortunately, there’s no silver bullet for solving it. So we try to come at the issue from a few different angles, using both technological solutions that can scale broadly as well as human reviewers, who can understand context and nuance. In the video above, I’ll walk you through some of our work around false news and provide an update on how I think we’re doing. To reduce the spread of false news, we remove fake accounts and disrupt economic incentives for traffickers of misinformation. We also use various signals, including feedback from our community, to identify potential false news. In countries where we have partnerships with independent third-party fact-checkers, stories rated as false by those fact-checkers are shown lower in News Feed. If Pages or domains repeatedly create or share misinformation, we significantly reduce their distribution and remove their advertising rights. We also want to empower people to decide for themselves what to read, trust, and share. We promote news literacy and work to inform people with more context. For example, if third-party fact-checkers write articles about a news story, we show them immediately below the story in the Related Articles unit. We also notify people and Page Admins if they try to share a story, or have shared one in the past, that’s been determined to be false. In addition to our own efforts, we’re learning from academics, scaling our partnerships with third-party fact-checkers and talking to other organizations about how we can work together. There’s a lot of work that’s been done and a lot more work to do. But most things worth doing are never finished. Watch this space for further updates.

As with all information on the internet, if we’re unfamiliar with an article’s source or subject matter, it can be hard to come to an informed conclusion about its accuracy. As the team designing against misinformation on News Feed, we care a lot about giving people the tools to make informed decisions about which stories to read, trust, and share. We recently announced the US launch of a feature that gives people more background on both the publisher and the article. We want to share the process behind this product. How It Began The genesis of this feature came out of our work on Related Articles. We learned that showing other content related to a story — for example, reporting from a certified third-party fact-checker — acts as a strong signal to help determine the credibility and accuracy of that story. We wanted to enable people to get similar context across a number of situations, especially when they came across an article in News Feed. Early concepts for accessing “Related Articles” on any story in News Feed. Our early concepts let people press and hold an article to see related content on that story; with that initial concept, we wanted to take a research-driven approach to developing the feature further. Sprinting to Understand Credibility People make judgments about a story’s credibility through a wide range of factors. Do they recognize the publisher’s name? How long has the publisher been around? Which of their trusted friends and family also read this source? As we began to explore other ways to design this feature, we surveyed and spoke to people about how they consumed news and other links on Facebook. We read dozens of academic research papers and grounded our explorations in studies about “source credibility.” Source credibility is a concept that started in television and newspaper studies in the 1980s and more recently expanded to online content, showing the shift in audiences’ uses of reporters’ style, facial expressions, and choice of topics to judge news content to the ways in which online social systems can provide additional social signals about news-related information. Understanding perceptions of credibility is complex: factors from publisher familiarity to design features, from message language to individual verification skills, all impact how people determine if an article is high or low quality. We paired our reading on this topic with other research covering how people interpret signals or warnings, how people think about news through political biases such as “selective exposure”, “motivated reasoning”, and more. We also considered recent societal trends like major shifts in perceptions of misinformation (“most Americans believe it is now harder to be well-informed and to determine which news is accurate” Knight Foundation 2018) or trust in the media (“in many countries the underlying drivers of mistrust are as much to do with deep-rooted political polarization and perceived mainstream media bias,” Reuters Institute 2017). What has been studied less frequently are the kinds of information signals that might work for people on Facebook. How might people respond to particular signals within the design of News Feed? What unique objective information is Facebook best positioned to provide? We began to explore these questions through surveys, finding that people encountered difficulty with determining the credibility of information (already-discovered in recent academic research) related in particular to unfamiliar websites and highly partisan content. We then took the next step to explore potential design options through a loose Design Sprint process. Early last year, we gathered a dozen designers and researchers, with whom we collaborated on designing a surface for these new bits of information as well as what that information — segmented into modules — could look like. Examples of the module designs we tested with people in the lab and in the field. Participants would be asked to sort the printed out cards for which would help them ascertain the credibility of an article. After designing a variety of options, we immediately spoke to and validated with Facebook users in our research lab and in the field, looking at differences in ways that people assessed the information (whether they were high- or low-news consumers, politically ambivalent or partisan, and of various demographic backgrounds). In particular, we conducted semi-structured interviews to learn more about people’s news reading and evaluating habits and card sorts to determine which information modules could be most effective. Out of Sight, Out of Mind We know that many people are busy and can be distracted when using Facebook. Many scroll through News Feed on the bus, while taking a break from work, or at home cooking. It’s easy for people to miss details, even important ones. Therefore, a critical challenge with this feature was helping people find the entry point and clearly communicating its value. Early on, we tested a static entry point with a relatable icon (identified through early interviews). However, we found that people frequently missed the button. After later conducting in-depth interviews with eye-tracking, we learned that — when evaluating articles on Facebook — the same three areas overall tended to draw people’s attention (ordered depending on the individual): A) The face of the friend, group, or Page who shared the post, B) Faces (if present) in the article’s preview image, and C) The headline of the article. Given this information, we realized that putting the entry point to this feature near the headline would be a more-effective way to engage than on the upper right corner (as originally conceived). We also learned that people adapted quickly, and they were willing and interested in revisiting this space after the first visit, particularly for sources that they were unfamiliar with. When the entry point button was animated, people were more likely to notice it. In an eye-tracking study, the participant sits in front of an interactive prototype, and software tracks their eye movement across the prototype. In the image above, red dots and lines show where one participant looked. Without the animated expanding entry point (left), many people skipped the (i) button and focused more on the headline. With the animation and additional text (the “glimpse” we created), people redirected their gaze. One of the ways we tested making this space even more discoverable was by adding an animation to the entry point, which would activate after dwelling on an article. The animation drew people’s attention… but it had more potential. We conceived of “glimpsing,” or providing a button that: Would animate to attract attention, and Could also provide additional relevant information. The animation therefore served to draw a person’s attention and dynamically inform people that both 1) the feature existed, and 2) that there was relevant information that they should care about within the pop-up. As we explore more opportunities for the glimpse, we are considering providing additional, quick signals about the article (for instance, if the article is trending). Going Global While we’re starting with just a US launch of these signals, one of the primary concerns we had with this feature was making sure that it could work across cultures, particularly in places where news literacy differed or news ecosystems and markets were more complicated. While this work started with a diverse set of participants in the US, we took this feature around the world to make sure it could work in a variety of settings. In Western Europe, we found that it could play a key role before critical moments like elections, where people were particularly sensitive to the kinds of information that appeared in their News Feed. People want a quick and easy way to evaluate information in their News Feed, especially something that could replace frequent “look it up on a search engine” behaviors without leaving the Facebook app. More recently, we conducted fieldwork in Southeast Asia, showing how different local news ecosystems, news markets, and audience behaviors in Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines led to different ways in which people approached gathering more information (for instance, relying more on social signals and comments). It was promising to find that in every market, people were excited to have a tool at their immediate disposal to provide more information about how they could understand the quality of any article. Testing this feature with people in Myanmar. As we’ve explored the potential for this feature internationally, we’ve found some interesting insights. People care deeply about being able to trust the news they see on Facebook. People want a quick and easy way to evaluate information in their News Feed, especially something that could replace frequent “look it up on a search engine” behaviors without leaving the Facebook app. People could use it to triangulate across different types of information to evaluate the credibility of an article, aligning with recent work on “lateral reading” in information literacy. Finally, people wanted to gain more opportunities — and more confidence — in being able to determine the credibility of information they encountered on their own, and this was true on any side of the political spectrum in every single country we visited. What We’re Launching Now With all of these research insights, we’re launching this feature in the US with 4 important credibility signals: Page information: Sometimes people don’t know the source of an article in their News Feed. Showing information about the Page that published the original article lets people get further context on who the publisher is. They can then follow or unfollow the publisher directly from this surface. Wikipedia information: Providing context from external experts or third-party organizations is helpful. Wikipedia is a generally trusted encyclopedia with a robust, community-maintained revision process. It also has global recognition, so is a particularly useful feature internationally. Referencing the Wikipedia section about a publisher within the unit gives users a way of getting quick consensus or history on a publisher. Likewise, in our research, the absence of a Wikipedia page was an important credibility cue for users. Related articles or more from the publisher: People want to compare information from the same source to see what style of language/wording or selection of topics a publisher covers. Similarly, people can compare the reporting of one publisher to others on a particular event. Much like how we use Related Articles in News Feed, this unit give users another angle on a story and a way to pivot into similar content if they’re interested. Share distribution from friends and the Facebook community: Who and how many people share an article — especially when they’re your friends — can be insightful into the background (or bias) of an article. We’ve included the number of shares from across Facebook and which of your friends have shared an article. We’ve also included a map showing where the article was shared to break up an otherwise text-heavy surface and in some cases gives a sense of where the article got the most traction. The final designs and what we launched to the US. There is a lot more we can do with this feature, and a lot more we need to do to roll this out responsibly in other countries. As we continue talking with more people about credibility and learning more about recent research on signals of trust, our focus will be on improving these information modules and integrating it and additional features, into other parts of Facebook. This work wouldn’t have been possible without the help of Tiffany Yen, Sara Su, Maryanna Rogers, Cat Audi, Earl Carlson, Cassandra Jaime, Megan Yang, Rahul Fernandes, and many others for their contributions to this work.

We’re now rolling out this feature to everyone in the US and adding additional features to provide more context for people so they can decide for themselves what to read, trust and share. Research with our community and our academic and industry partners has identified some key information that helps people evaluate the credibility of an article and determine whether to trust the article’s source. Based on this research, we’re making it easy for people to view context about an article, including the publisher’s Wikipedia entry, related articles on the same topic, information about how many times the article has been shared on Facebook, where it is has been shared, as well as an option to follow the publisher’s page. When a publisher does not have a Wikipedia entry, we will indicate that the information is unavailable, which can also be helpful context. In addition to the information included in our original test, we’re introducing two new features that will give readers more context: More From This Publisher, which will give people a quick snapshot of the other recent stories posted by the publisher Shared By Friends, which will show people any of their friends who have shared the article We’re also starting a test to see whether people find it easier to evaluate the credibility of an article when we provide more information about the article’s author. People in this test will be able to tap an author’s name in Instant Articles to see additional information, including a description from the author’s Wikipedia entry, a button to follow their Page or Profile, and other recent articles they’ve published. This information will only display if the publisher has implemented author tags on their website to associate the author’s Page or Profile to the article byline, and the publisher has validated their association to the publisher. This will start as a small test in the US, and we look forward to learning from the results. We designed these features with feedback and input from a diverse set of people and publishers, including many participants in the Facebook Journalism Project. Developing a way to provide objective context about the stories people see on Facebook was a unique design challenge. We wrote more about this process on our Facebook Design blog. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to improve this experience and help give people more context about the news they see on Facebook. Update 5/31: Today, we’re also starting to roll out this feature in the UK. Update 9/19: Today, we’re also starting to roll out the context button in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. We will now also share website/domain age, which will give people more information about the source — see below for updated visuals. We’re expanding our coverage from articles to all links. Update 10/9: Today, we’re also starting to roll out the context button in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Update 10/25: Today, we’re also starting to roll out the context button in France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland and Spain. Update 12/12: Today, we are beginning to roll out the context button globally. When available, we will surface information about a website so people can learn more about it. If that information is not available, we will give people the option to suggest a Facebook Page for a domain, and direct publishers to the Help Center to learn about how to get the context button for their Page/website."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/03/privacy-shortcuts/","date":"2018-03-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"It’s Time to Make Our Privacy Tools Easier to Find","text":"By Erin Egan, VP and Chief Privacy Officer, Policy and Ashlie Beringer, VP and Deputy General Counsel Last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies and help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data. We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed. So in addition to Mark Zuckerberg’s announcements last week – cracking down on abuse of the Facebook platform, strengthening our policies, and making it easier for people to revoke apps’ ability to use your data – we’re taking additional steps in the coming weeks to put people more in control of their privacy. Most of these updates have been in the works for some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance. Making Data Settings and Tools Easier to Find Controls that are easier to find and use. We’ve redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top to bottom to make things easier to find. Instead of having settings spread across nearly 20 different screens, they’re now accessible from a single place. We’ve also cleaned up outdated settings so it’s clear what information can and can’t be shared with apps. A comparison of the old settings menu (left) and new settings menu (right). New Privacy Shortcuts menu. People have also told us that information about privacy, security, and ads should be much easier to find. The new Privacy Shortcuts is a menu where you can control your data in just a few taps, with clearer explanations of how our controls work. The experience is now clearer, more visual, and easy-to-find. From here you can: Make your account more secure: You can add more layers of protection to your account, like two-factor authentication. If you turn this on and someone tries to log into your account from a device we don’t recognize, you’ll be asked to confirm whether it was you. Control your personal information: You can review what you’ve shared and delete it if you want to. This includes posts you’ve shared or reacted to, friend requests you’ve sent, and things you’ve searched for on Facebook. Control the ads you see: You can manage the information we use to show you ads. Ad preferences explains how ads work and the options you have. Manage who sees your posts and profile information: You own what you share on Facebook, and you can manage things like who sees your posts and the information you choose to include on your profile. Tools to find, download and delete your Facebook data. It’s one thing to have a policy explaining what data we collect and use, but it’s even more useful when people see and manage their own information. Some people want to delete things they’ve shared in the past, while others are just curious about the information Facebook has. So we’re introducing Access Your Information – a secure way for people to access and manage their information, such as posts, reactions, comments, and things you’ve searched for. You can go here to delete anything from your timeline or profile that you no longer want on Facebook. We’re also making it easier to download the data you’ve shared with Facebook – it’s your data, after all. You can download a secure copy and even move it to another service. This includes photos you’ve uploaded, contacts you’ve added to your account, posts on your timeline, and more. The Road Ahead It’s also our responsibility to tell you how we collect and use your data in language that’s detailed, but also easy to understand. In the coming weeks, we’ll be proposing updates to Facebook’s terms of service that include our commitments to people. We’ll also update our data policy to better spell out what data we collect and how we use it. These updates are about transparency – not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data. We’ve worked with regulators, legislators and privacy experts on these tools and updates. We’ll have more to share in the coming weeks, including updates on the measures Mark shared last week."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/03/news-feed-fyi-more-local-news-on-facebook-globally/","date":"2018-03-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"More Local News on Facebook, Globally","text":"By Alex Hardiman, Head of News Product, and Campbell Brown, Head of News Partnerships Local news helps people connect to their communities about the issues that are closest to home.

We’ve been working closely with creators to understand what they need to be successful on Facebook. To support them, we’re focused on three areas: helping them engage and grow their community, manage their presence, and build a business on Facebook. We’re already investing deeply in these areas — like with the Facebook Creator app and Facebook for Creators site we introduced last year. In the coming months, we’ll be testing a range of new tools for creators. We’re still in an experimental phase and will be iterating on these tests in the coming months, but we want to share a preview of what we’re working on. Engaging and Growing Creators’ Communities We’re committed to giving creators great ways to share and build connections with their community. For example, creators like Sebastian Villalobos use Live and Live With to talk in real time with their fans. Markian shares moments from his day using Facebook Stories, and many creators have Groups where fans can more deeply engage with each other – like Tessa Netting’s superfan Group. We’re also exploring ways to bring people together around video, like with Watch Party. As we continue to help creators build relationships with their audiences, we’re going to make it easier to identify and connect with their most passionate fans. We’re starting a new test that highlights a creator’s top fans by displaying a badge next to their names and adding their name to a leaderboard of highly engaged fans. We’ll identify top fans based on how often they comment, share, react or watch a creator’s content, as well as the creator’s interactions with the fan and other criteria. Fans will opt into this experience, and they can turn off the feature at any time. This test will start with a small set of creators in the coming weeks. Managing Creators’ Presence on Facebook We need to make it easy for creators to manage their presence on Facebook. We’ve always offered detailed Page Insights to help people understand how their posts perform, and last year we rolled out our Facebook for Creators website and Creator app on iOS globally. Thousands of creators including Belly Full, Wuz Good, Juanma Salazar, Archana’s Kitchen, and LeJuan James are using the Creator app to get insights about their audience and more easily talk and share with fans. We’re working to bring the Facebook Creator app to Android soon. We are always looking for more opportunities to help creators manage their content on Facebook, and are now testing a content rights management tool designed specifically for creators. This new version of our Rights Manager tool includes simplified and more automated capabilities, which we hope will make it easier for people to use the system and get recognition for their work. Building a Business on Facebook As creators spend more time making content and engaging with their fans, they want to be able to earn money for their work. We plan to offer a range of monetization options to serve the wide range of creators at various stages of their journeys. Today any creator can use branded content to extend their existing brand deals onto Facebook. We’ve also made Ad Breaks available to a small set of creators creating shows for Watch. Creators who would like to make and monetize shows for Watch can register their interest here. In the coming months, we’re going to explore two new monetization features for creators. First is a tool that helps advertisers and creators easily connect for branded content opportunities on Facebook. Creators participating in the test can set up a portfolio highlighting their area of expertise, and advertisers can search and find creators to collaborate on compelling branded content campaigns. Additionally, we’ll be testing a way for fans to become a supporter of the creators they love. Fans will have the option to support the creator with a monthly payment in exchange for perks like exclusive content and a badge highlighting their status as a supporter. We’ll start testing with a small set of creators so we can gather feedback from them and their fans before expanding. (Note that testing this feature means the Facebook app will now include an “In App Purchase” label in the App Store and Google Play.) Collaborative Development with Creators We’re excited about all of the things we’ll be building this year and know there’s a lot more yet to do. To help us learn and build the things creators want and need, we will be piloting a product testing program with a small group of creators, which will include many of the tools mentioned above. Creators in this program will get access to early test features and will spend time with our team to provide frequent and direct feedback. The goal of this collaborative product test is to help us more quickly iterate and build experiences that will benefit our entire creator community. We encourage creators to join the Facebook for Creators community at facebook.com/creators/join to be considered for product testing opportunities and be notified about when new features become available."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/03/news-feed-fyi-ending-the-explore-feed-test/","date":"2018-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI","Product News"],"title":"Ending the Explore Feed Test","text":"By Adam Mosseri, Head of News Feed We constantly try out new features, design changes and ranking updates to understand how we can make Facebook better for everyone. Some of these changes—like Reactions, Live Video, and GIFs— work well and go on to become globally available. Others don’t and we drop them. Today, we’re ending one of those tests: the Explore Feed. The Explore Feed was a trial response to consistent feedback we received from people over the past year who said they want to see more from friends and family in News Feed. The idea was to create a version of Facebook with two different News Feeds: one as a dedicated place with posts from friends and family and another as a dedicated place for posts from Pages. To understand if people might like two separate feeds, we started a test in October 2017 in six countries. You gave us our answer: People don’t want two separate feeds. In surveys, people told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing, and having two separate feeds didn’t actually help them connect more with friends and family. We think our recent changes to News Feed that prioritize meaningful social interactions better address the feedback we heard from people who said they want to see more from friends and family. Those changes mean less public content in News Feed like posts from businesses, brands, and media. We also received feedback that we made it harder for people in the test countries to access important information, and that we didn’t communicate the test clearly. We’re acting on this feedback by updating the way we evaluate where to test new products, and how we communicate about them. Separately, we’re also discontinuing the Explore Feed bookmark globally this week. Explore gave people a new feed of content to discover Pages and public figures they hadn’t previously followed. We concluded that Explore isn’t an effective way for people to discover new content on Facebook. We’re always looking to help people connect with the people and information that matter most to them. Both of these tests provided us with valuable feedback that we will use to improve News Feed for everyone."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/02/jobs/","date":"2018-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Helping People Find Jobs and Local Businesses Hire","text":"By Alex Himel, VP of Local Local businesses strengthen our communities and create more than 60% of new jobs. We want to help people find those jobs and help local businesses hire the right people, so, we’re expanding the ability to apply to jobs directly on Facebook to more than 40 countries. In an online poll of 5,000 adults conducted by Morning Consult, one in four people in the US said they searched for, or found a job using Facebook. Since introducing job postings on Facebook in the US and Canada last year, we’ve built new features for businesses like the ability to create job posts on mobile, manage applications, and schedule interviews. Job-seekers can also set up job alerts for the type of roles they’re interested in. Here’s what we’ve heard from a few local businesses: Troy, the owner of Striper Sniper Tackle in North Carolina had trouble finding people with the specific skills he needed until he posted the job on his Facebook Page. He received 27 applications immediately, and hired 10 people. Ben, operations manager at Sky Zone, an indoor trampoline park in Illinois, received more than 200 applications, and filled 11 positions in one week. “We had more of the right type of candidate apply through Facebook… It was also much easier to look through applications on Facebook, and I think it was easier for candidates to complete job postings,” he said. Michelle and Eddie, owners of two Edible Arrangements stores in North Carolina, received 97 applications and were able to fill seven open positions in three weeks using Facebook, spending only $20 USD to boost the post in News Feed. How It Works For Job-Seekers Finding a job is quick, easy and free. You can find jobs in the Jobs dashboard at facebook.com/jobs and the “Jobs” option in the “Explore” section on mobile, by clicking the Jobs icon in Marketplace, or visiting the Jobs tab of a business’ Page. When you’re ready to apply for a role, you can create an application, which will populate with job history and other information in your Facebook profile. You can edit your application before you submit it. Once you finish applying, a Messenger conversation will open with the business’ Page so you can have direct contact with the employer and confirm when your information has been received. Businesses will only be able to see information you provide them directly, and what’s available publicly on your Facebook profile. To stay on top of the type of job you’re interested in, you can also subscribe to alerts. For Businesses Businesses can attract the right applicants and hire quickly, easily and affordably. Page admins can create job posts directly from their Page with details like job title, job type (full-time, intern, part-time), salary and more. Job posts will appear in multiple places on Facebook, including on a business’ Page, in the Jobs dashboard, in Marketplace, and in News Feed. Job posts can appear in News Feed similar to other Page posts, and businesses can choose to boost posts to reach the right candidates. Businesses can also manage their applications and communicate with applicants, including scheduling interviews and sending automated reminders, directly through Messenger. We know there is more Facebook can do to connect people and businesses. Since 2011, Facebook has invested more than $1 billion to help local businesses grow and help people find jobs. And in 2018 we plan to invest the same amount in more teams, technology, and new programs. Because when businesses succeed, communities thrive.

They also say they want to see news about what’s happening in the world and their local community. This month, we’ve announced changes to prioritize posts from friends and high-quality news sources. Today, we’re updating News Feed to also prioritize local news so that you can see topics that have a direct impact on you and your community and discover what’s happening in your local area. We identify local publishers as those whose links are clicked on by readers in a tight geographic area. If a story is from a publisher in your area, and you either follow the publisher’s Page or your friend shares a story from that outlet, it might show up higher in News Feed. To start, this change is taking effect in the US, and we plan to expand to more countries this year. You can always choose which news sources, including local or national publications, that you want to see at the top of your feed with our See First feature. What This Means for Publishers As we announced earlier this month, we expect the amount of news in News Feed to go down as we focus on meaningful social interactions with family and friends over passive consumption. We are prioritizing local news as a part of our emphasis on high-quality news, and with today’s update, stories from local news publishers may appear higher in News Feed for followers in publishers’ geographic areas. This change is one of the many signals that go into News Feed ranking. For more, see our Publisher Guidelines. There are no constraints on which publishers are eligible, which means large local publishers will benefit, as well as publishers that focus on niche topics like local sports, arts and human-interest stories. That said, small news outlets may benefit from this change more than other outlets, because they tend to have a concentrated readership in one location. This is just the beginning of our efforts to prioritize high-quality news. This update may not capture all small or niche-interest publishers at first, but we are working to improve precision and coverage over time. All of our work to reduce false news, misinformation, clickbait, sensationalism and inauthentic accounts still applies. Our Commitment to Local News We’ve worked closely with local publishers through the Facebook Journalism Project over the last year, visiting newsrooms around the world to provide training and support for journalists, as well as building products that work for their publications and readers. Local news publishers participated in the majority of our collaborative product tests in 2017, including support for subscriptions in Instant Articles; call-to-action units, which are prompts for readers to like a publisher’s page or sign up for an email newsletter; and a new breaking news format in News Feed. In addition to prioritizing local news, we are also testing a dedicated section on Facebook that connects people to news and information in their community, called Today In. We are testing this in six US cities and plan to expand in the coming months. These efforts to prioritize quality news in News Feed, including this local initiative, are a direct result of the ongoing collaboration with partners. Our goal is to show more news that connects people to their local communities, and we look forward to improving and expanding these efforts this year."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/01/control-privacy-principles/","date":"2018-01-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Giving You More Control of Your Privacy on Facebook","text":"By Erin Egan, Chief Privacy Officer As part of Data Privacy Day, we’re introducing a new education campaign to help you understand how data is used on Facebook and how you can manage your own data. We’re also announcing plans to make your core privacy settings easier to find, and sharing our privacy principles for the first time. These principles guide our work at Facebook. Helping You Take Control of Your Data on Facebook You have many ways to control your data on Facebook. This includes tools to make sure you share only what you want with the people you want to see it. But privacy controls are only powerful if you know how to find and use them. Starting today we’re introducing educational videos in News Feed that help you get information on important privacy topics like how to control what information Facebook uses to show you ads, how to review and delete old posts, and even what it means to delete your account. We’re also inviting people to take our Privacy Checkup and sharing privacy tips in education campaigns off Facebook, including ads on other websites. We’ll refresh our education campaigns throughout the year to give you tips on different topics. Making Privacy Settings Easier to Find We know how important it is for you to have clear, simple tools for managing your privacy. This year, we’ll introduce a new privacy center that features core privacy settings in a single place. We’re designing this based on feedback from people, policymakers and privacy experts around the world. Facebook’s Privacy Principles Our efforts to build data protection into our products and give you more information and control reflect core principles we’ve had on privacy. Today we’re sharing these principles for the first time here, and we’ve included them below. We’re also developing resources that help other organizations build privacy into their services. For example, throughout 2018 we’re hosting workshops on data protection for small and medium businesses, beginning in Europe with a focus on the new General Data Protection Regulation. We hosted our first workshop in Brussels last week and published a guide for frequently asked questions. Around the world we’ll continue to host Design Jams that bring designers, developers, privacy experts and regulators together to create new ways of educating people on privacy and giving them control of their information. We’ll keep improving our privacy tools and look forward to hearing what you think. Facebook’s Privacy Principles Facebook was built to bring people closer together. We help you connect with friends and family, discover local events and find groups to join. We recognize that people use Facebook to connect, but not everyone wants to share everything with everyone – including with us. It’s important that you have choices when it comes to how your data is used. These are the principles that guide how we approach privacy at Facebook. We give you control of your privacy You should be able to make the privacy choices that are right for you. We want to make sure you know where your privacy controls are and how to adjust them. For example, our audience selector tool lets you decide who you share with for every post. We develop controls based on feedback from around the world. We help people understand how their data is used While our Data Policy describes our practices in detail, we go beyond this to give you even more information. For example, we include education and tools in people’s day-to-day use of Facebook – like ad controls in the top right corner of every ad. We design privacy into our products from the outset We design privacy into Facebook products with guidance from experts in areas like data protection and privacy law, security, interface design, engineering, product management, and public policy. Our privacy team works to build these diverse perspectives into every stage of product development. We work hard to keep your information secure We work around the clock to help protect people’s accounts, and we build security into every Facebook product. Our security systems run millions of times per second to help catch threats automatically and remove them before they ever reach you. You can also use our security tools like two-factor authentication to help keep your account even more secure. You own and can delete your information You own the information you share on Facebook. This means you decide what you share and who you share it with on Facebook, and you can change your mind. That’s why we give you tools for deleting anything you’ve posted. We remove it from your timeline and from our servers. You can also delete your account whenever you want. Improvement is constant We’re constantly working to develop new controls and design them in ways that explain things to people clearly. We invest in research and work with experts beyond Facebook including designers, developers, privacy professionals and regulators. We are accountable In addition to comprehensive privacy reviews, we put products through rigorous data security testing. We also meet with regulators, legislators and privacy experts around the world to get input on our data practices and policies."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/01/trusted-sources/","date":"2018-01-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI","Product News"],"title":"Helping Ensure News on Facebook Is From Trusted Sources","text":"By Adam Mosseri, Head of News Feed Last week, we announced major changes to News Feed that are designed to help bring people closer together by encouraging more meaningful connections on Facebook. As a result, people will see less public content, including news, video and posts from brands. Today we’re sharing the second major update we’re making this year: to make sure the news people see, while less overall, is high quality. Last year, we worked hard to reduce fake news and clickbait, and to destroy the economic incentives for spammers to generate these articles in the first place. But there is more we can do. In 2018, we will prioritize: News from publications that the community rates as trustworthy News that people find informative News that is relevant to people’s local community To be clear, you can still decide which stories appear at the top of News Feed with our See First feature. Trusted Sources Starting next week, we will begin tests in the first area: to prioritize news from publications that the community rates as trustworthy. How? We surveyed a diverse and representative sample of people using Facebook across the US to gauge their familiarity with, and trust in, various different sources of news. This data will help to inform ranking in News Feed. We’ll start with the US and plan to roll this out internationally in the future. Informative Content When we rank and make improvements to News Feed, we rely on a set of core values. These values — which we’ve been using for years — guide our thinking and help us keep the central experience of News Feed intact as it evolves. One of our News Feed values is that the stories in your feed should be informative. For informative sources, we will continue to improve on the work we first announced in August 2016, where we began asking people to rank the informativeness of updates in their feed on a scale of one to five. We’re evaluating ways to expand this work to more areas this year. Local News Finally, people want more local news on Facebook. As we announced this month, we’re making it easier for people to see local news and information in a dedicated section. We’ll continue to work on ways to show more local news that is relevant to where people live. What This Means for Publishers We’ll be working on these efforts for the rest of the year. For the first change in the US next week, publications deemed trustworthy by people using Facebook may see an increase in their distribution. Publications that do not score highly as trusted by the community may see a decrease. These changes will be part of the many signals that go into News Feed ranking. For more information about ranking more generally see our Publisher Guidelines. Update on July 2, 2018: We’ve started prioritizing broadly trusted sources in India, the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Update on August 21, 2018: We’ve expanded this list to include Brazil."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/","date":"2018-01-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI","Product News","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Bringing People Closer Together","text":"By Adam Mosseri, Head of News Feed Facebook was built to bring people closer together and build relationships. One of the ways we do this is by connecting people to meaningful posts from their friends and family in News Feed. Over the next few months, we’ll be making updates to ranking so people have more opportunities to interact with the people they care about. Mark outlined this in a post today. What is the update? Today we use signals like how many people react to, comment on or share posts to determine how high they appear in News Feed. With this update, we will also prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people. To do this, we will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about, and show these posts higher in feed. These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to – whether that’s a post from a friend seeking advice, a friend asking for recommendations for a trip, or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion. We will also prioritize posts from friends and family over public content, consistent with our News Feed values. What does this mean for Pages and public content? Because space in News Feed is limited, showing more posts from friends and family and updates that spark conversation means we’ll show less public content, including videos and other posts from publishers or businesses. As we make these updates, Pages may see their reach, video watch time and referral traffic decrease. The impact will vary from Page to Page, driven by factors including the type of content they produce and how people interact with it. Pages making posts that people generally don’t react to or comment on could see the biggest decreases in distribution. Pages whose posts prompt conversations between friends will see less of an effect. Can people still see posts from the Pages they follow at the top of News Feed? Yes. People who want to see more posts from Pages they follow can choose See First in News Feed Preferences to make sure they always see posts from their favorite Pages. What types of Page posts will show higher in News Feed? Page posts that generate conversation between people will show higher in News Feed. For example, live videos often lead to discussion among viewers on Facebook – in fact, live videos on average get six times as many interactions as regular videos. Many creators who post videos on Facebook prompt discussion among their followers, as do posts from celebrities. In Groups, people often interact around public content. Local businesses connect with their communities by posting relevant updates and creating events. And news can help start conversations on important issues. Using “engagement-bait” to goad people into commenting on posts is not a meaningful interaction, and we will continue to demote these posts in News Feed. Does this mean you are eliminating Page content from News Feed? No. This update is not the same as the recent tests where all Page content was moved to the Explore Tab. Page posts will still appear in News Feed, though there may be fewer of them."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-updates-in-our-fight-against-misinformation/","date":"2017-12-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Replacing Disputed Flags With Related Articles","text":"By Tessa Lyons, Product Manager Facebook is about connecting you to the people that matter most. And discussing the news can be one way to start a meaningful conversation with friends or family. It’s why helping to ensure that you get accurate information on Facebook is so important to us. Today, we’re announcing two changes which we believe will help in our fight against false news. First, we will no longer use Disputed Flags to identify false news. Instead we’ll use Related Articles to help give people more context about the story. Here’s why. Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs – the opposite effect to what we intended. Related Articles, by contrast, are simply designed to give more context, which our research has shown is a more effective way to help people get to the facts. Indeed, we’ve found that when we show Related Articles next to a false news story, it leads to fewer shares than when the Disputed Flag is shown. Second, we are starting a new initiative to better understand how people decide whether information is accurate or not based on the news sources they depend upon. This will not directly impact News Feed in the near term. However, it may help us better measure our success in improving the quality of information on Facebook over time. False news undermines the unique value that Facebook offers: the ability for you to connect with family and friends in meaningful ways. It’s why we’re investing in better technology and more people to help prevent the spread of misinformation. Overall, we’re making progress. Demoting false news (as identified by fact-checkers) is one of our best weapons because demoted articles typically lose 80 percent of their traffic. This destroys the economic incentives spammers and troll farms have to generate these articles in the first place. But there’s much more to do. By showing Related Articles rather than Disputed Flags we can help give people better context. And understanding how people decide what’s false and what’s not will be crucial to our success over time. Please keep giving us your feedback because we’ll be redoubling our efforts in 2018."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/12/managing-your-identity-on-facebook-with-face-recognition-technology/","date":"2017-12-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Product News","Technology & Innovation"],"title":"Managing Your Identity on Facebook With Face Recognition Technology","text":"By Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, Director, Applied Machine Learning Update on September 3, 2019 at 1:25PM PT: Starting today, people who newly join Facebook or who previously had the tag suggestions setting will have the face recognition setting. Read more here. Originally published on December 19, 2017 at 7:30AM PT: Today we’re announcing new, optional tools to help people better manage their identity on Facebook using face recognition. Powered by the same technology we’ve used to suggest friends you may want to tag in photos or videos, these new features help you find photos that you’re not tagged in and help you detect when others might be attempting to use your image as their profile picture. We’re also introducing a way for people who are visually impaired to know more about who is in the photos they encounter on Facebook. People gave us feedback that they would find it easier to manage face recognition through a simple setting, so we’re pairing these tools with a single “on/off” control. If your tag suggestions setting is currently set to “none,” then your default face recognition setting will be set to “off” and will remain that way until you decide to change it. Know When You Appear in Photos on Facebook Now, if you’re in a photo and are part of the audience for that post, we’ll notify you, even if you haven’t been tagged. You’re in control of your image on Facebook and can make choices such as whether to tag yourself, leave yourself untagged, or reach out to the person who posted the photo if you have concerns about it. We always respect the privacy setting people select when posting a photo on Facebook (whether that’s friends, public or a custom audience), so you won’t receive a notification if you’re not in the audience. Profile Photo Safety We want people to feel confident when they post pictures of themselves on Facebook so we’ll soon begin using face recognition technology to let people know when someone else uploads a photo of them as their profile picture. We’re doing this to prevent people from impersonating others on Facebook. New Tools for People with Visual Impairments We’re always working to make it easier for all people, regardless of ability, to access Facebook, make connections and have more opportunities. Two years ago, we launched an automatic alt-text tool, which describes photos to people with vision loss. Now, with face recognition, people who use screen readers will know who appears in photos in their News Feed even if people aren’t tagged. How it Works and the Choices You Have Since 2010, face recognition technology has helped bring people closer together on Facebook. Our technology analyzes the pixels in photos you’re already tagged in and generates a string of numbers we call a template. When photos and videos are uploaded to our systems, we compare those images to the template. You control whether Facebook can recognize you in photos and videos. Soon, you will begin to see a simple on/off switch instead of settings for individual features that use face recognition technology. We designed this as an on/off switch because people gave us feedback that they prefer a simpler control than having to decide for every single feature using face recognition technology. To learn more about all of these features, visit the Help Center or your account settings. We are introducing these new features in most places, except in Canada and the EU where we don’t currently offer face recognition technology."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-fighting-engagement-bait-on-facebook/","date":"2017-12-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Fighting Engagement Bait on Facebook","text":"By Henry Silverman, Operations Integrity Specialist and Lin Huang, Engineer People have told us that they dislike spammy posts on Facebook that goad them into interacting with likes, shares, comments, and other actions. For example, “LIKE this if you’re an Aries!” This tactic, known as “engagement bait,” seeks to take advantage of our News Feed algorithm by boosting engagement in order to get greater reach. So, starting this week, we will begin demoting individual posts from people and Pages that use engagement bait. To help us foster more authentic engagement, teams at Facebook have reviewed and categorized hundreds of thousands of posts to inform a machine learning model that can detect different types of engagement bait. Posts that use this tactic will be shown less in News Feed. Additionally, over the coming weeks, we will begin implementing stricter demotions for Pages that systematically and repeatedly use engagement bait to artificially gain reach in News Feed. We will roll out this Page-level demotion over the course of several weeks to give publishers time to adapt and avoid inadvertently using engagement bait in their posts. Moving forward, we will continue to find ways to improve and scale our efforts to reduce engagement bait. Posts that ask people for help, advice, or recommendations, such as circulating a missing child report, raising money for a cause, or asking for travel tips, will not be adversely impacted by this update. Instead, we will demote posts that go against one of our key News Feed values — authenticity. Similar to our other recent efforts to demote clickbait headlines and links to low-quality web page experiences, we want to reduce the spread of content that is spammy, sensational, or misleading in order to promote more meaningful and authentic conversations on Facebook. How will this impact Pages? Publishers and other businesses that use engagement bait tactics in their posts should expect their reach on these posts to decrease. Meanwhile, Pages that repeatedly share engagement bait posts will see more significant drops in reach. Page Admins should continue to focus on posting relevant and meaningful stories that do not use engagement bait tactics. Learn more about engagement bait and how to avoid using it here. Update 4/4: In December, we announced that we would begin demoting individual posts in English from people and Pages that use engagement bait. We recently expanded this to Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, and German posts as well, and today are also extending this to posts in Portuguese. Update 4/26: Starting today, we have expanded this to posts in Mandarin, Hindi, Indonesian, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Thai, and Turkish. Update 6/25: Starting today, we have expanded this to posts in Bengali, Bulgarian, Dutch, Greek, Hungarian, Korean, Malay, Polish, and Romanian. Update 11/13: Starting today, we will be demoting comments which contain engagement bait. Update 1/30/19: Starting today, we will be demoting videos which contain engagement bait in the audio."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-snooze/","date":"2017-12-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI","Product News","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Introducing Snooze to Give You More Control Of Your News Feed","text":"By Shruthi Muraleedharan, Product Manager One of our core News Feed values is giving people more control. Over the next week, we’re launching Snooze, which will give you the option to temporarily unfollow a person, Page or group for 30 days. By selecting Snooze in the top-right drop-down menu of a post, you won’t see content from those people, Pages or groups in your News Feed for that time period. Seeing too many photos of your uncle’s new cat? Is your friend tempting you with endless photos of ramen on her Japan trip? It turns out, you’re not alone. We’ve heard from people that they want more options to determine what they see in News Feed and when they see it. With Snooze, you don’t have to unfollow or unfriend permanently, rather just stop seeing someone’s posts for a short period of time. The people, Pages, and groups you snooze will not be notified. You will be notified before the Snooze period is about to end and the setting can also be reversed at any time. Controls for your News Feed aren’t new.

Also with this update, we will show more videos in News Feed that people return to watch from the same publisher or creator week after week.

Facebook is a place where friends and family are already connected and we are able to help connect a person in distress with people who can support them. It’s part of our ongoing effort to help build a safe community on and off Facebook. Today, we are sharing additional work we’re doing to help people who are expressing thoughts of suicide, including: Using pattern recognition to detect posts or live videos where someone might be expressing thoughts of suicide, and to help respond to reports faster Improving how we identify appropriate first responders Dedicating more reviewers from our Community Operations team to review reports of suicide or self harm Over the last month, we’ve worked with first responders on over 100 wellness checks based on reports we received via our proactive detection efforts. This is in addition to reports we received from people in the Facebook community. We also use pattern recognition to help accelerate the most concerning reports. We’ve found these accelerated reports— that we have signaled require immediate attention—are escalated to local authorities twice as quickly as other reports. We are committed to continuing to invest in pattern recognition technology to better serve our community. Expanding our use of proactive detection We are starting to roll out artificial intelligence outside the US (except in the EU at present) to help identify when someone might be expressing thoughts of suicide, including on Facebook Live. This will eventually be available worldwide. This approach uses pattern recognition technology to help identify posts and live streams as likely to be expressing thoughts of suicide. We continue to work on this technology to increase accuracy and avoid false positives before our team reviews. We use signals like the text used in the post and comments (for example, comments like “Are you ok?” and “Can I help?” can be strong indicators). In some instances, we have found that the technology has identified videos that may have gone unreported. Improving how we identify first responders and dedicating more reviewers Our Community Operations team includes thousands of people around the world who review reports about content on Facebook. The team includes a dedicated group of specialists who have specific training in suicide and self harm. We are also using artificial intelligence to prioritize the order in which our team reviews reported posts, videos and live streams. This ensures we can get the right resources to people in distress and, where appropriate, we can more quickly alert first responders. Context is critical for our review teams, so we have developed ways to enhance our tools to get people help as quickly as possible. For example, our reviewers can quickly identify which points within a video receive increased levels of comments, reactions and reports from people on Facebook. Tools like these help reviewers understand whether someone may be in distress and get them help. In addition to those tools, we’re using automation so the team can more quickly access the appropriate first responders’ contact information. Our ongoing commitment to suicide prevention Already on Facebook if someone posts something that makes you concerned about their well-being, you can reach out to them directly or report the post to us. We have teams working around the world, 24/7, who review reports that come in and prioritize the most serious reports. We provide people with a number of support options, such as the option to reach out to a friend and even offer suggested text templates. We also suggest contacting a help line and offer other tips and resources for people to help themselves in that moment. Facebook has been working on suicide prevention tools for more than 10 years. Our approach was developed in collaboration with mental health organizations such as Save.org, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and Forefront Suicide Prevention and with input from people who have had personal experience thinking about or attempting suicide. They are also available globally — with the help of over 80 local partners — in whatever language people use Facebook in. With the help of our partners and people’s friends and family on Facebook, we hope we can continue to support those in need."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/11/providing-support-for-transgender-youth/","date":"2017-11-12T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook"],"title":"Providing Support for Transgender Youth","text":"Annie Tritt is a photographer with a knack for capturing people’s authentic selves.

Since the Summit, we’ve been busy building tools and programs that will help them grow and manage their communities, and today we’re announcing several of them: New Tools for Admins and Members Welcome Posts: For admins, welcoming new members and making them feel supported is critical to building community. To help them introduce new members to the group, admins can now write a welcome post that will automatically tag new joiners. Badges: We also heard that members want ways to easily identify group leaders and other members. That’s why we’ve also introduced badges for group admins, moderators and new members. Member profiles: Many people also tell us they often get to know other group members by reading their group posts and visiting their profiles. To help make this easier, we’re introducing a new feature called member profiles. Now, when group members click on another person’s name they will be directed to a group-specific profile, based on publicly-available information like things they may share in common and a feed of that person’s activity in the group. New controls: Finally, many admins spend hours each week making sure their Facebook groups stay supportive and safe, so we’ve built new features to help group admins grow and manage their communities. We’ve expanded the Group Insights tool to include helpful personalized tips, like scheduling posts at times when members are most engaged. We’ve also heard that conversations in even the most supportive groups can sometimes get heated, so we’ve created more tools for admins to manage members that might have forgotten group rules of conduct. Admins can now temporarily turn off a member’s ability to comment and post, and remove members who violate their community’s rules from multiple groups they manage in a single click. Building Relationships with Group Admins We loved getting to know group leaders at the Facebook Communities Summit, and we got to learn a lot more about the groups they manage: for example, we learned that most common categories of meaningful groups on Facebook in the US include local city and neighborhood groups, pregnancy and parenting groups, animal and pet groups, and occupation-focused groups. To give the admins of these groups more opportunities to connect with other community leaders, we started an invite-only group on Facebook where they can connect with one another and share feedback about their experiences, so we can provide the support they need to serve their communities. We’re also exploring programs to help these leaders meet up in person and keep the connection going— we’ll be announcing more about these new programs soon. Leaders Inspiring Change Since the Facebook Communities Summit, we’ve seen people use Facebook Groups to impact inspiring real-world change in their communities: In their first philanthropy project, Grown and Flown Parents used their group to raise money and buy dorm supplies for 225 first-generation freshmen at the University of Texas, helping these hard-working students get off to college on the right foot. Physician Moms Group (PMG) and Show Me Your Stethoscope rallied help in times of crisis, deploying first-response services and donations in the walk of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and raising over $15,000 to send food to first-responders following the Las Vegas shooting. Mendleton is a group of more than 40,000 active duty and veteran Marines. Through dialogue and camaraderie within their group, they’ve worked to provide support for servicemen and have prevented more than 100 suicides to date. They’ve also started a non-profit called the Mendleton Foundation, committed to ending military suicide. We’ve learned so much from working with group admins already, and this is just the beginning. There’s a lot more work to be done and we look forward to continue building the tools they need to bring the world closer together."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/10/marketplace-adds-more-options-for-us-car-shoppers/","date":"2017-10-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Marketplace Adds More Options For US Car Shoppers","text":"By Deborah Liu, VP, Marketplace Millions of Americans are using Marketplace every day to look for cars.

In response to this feedback, today we are releasing News Feed Publisher Guidelines, which include “do’s and don’ts” to help publishers succeed on our platform.

That’s the point. But somehow it’s gotten complicated. First you need to decide what to eat, then you have to sift through a bunch of options and services. Today, we’re taking the time out of finding what you want to eat by officially launching the ability to order food for pick-up or delivery, directly on Facebook. People already go to Facebook to figure out what to eat by reading about nearby restaurants, and seeing what their friends say about them. So, we’re making it even easier. Facebook combines options from a number of food ordering services like EatStreet, Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow and Olo, as well as restaurants like Jack in the Box, Five Guys, Papa John’s, and Panera, so you don’t have to search through multiple places to find what you’re looking for. From local spots to national chains, Facebook connects you with old favorites and new discoveries in just a few taps. You can even check out what your friends have to say about a restaurant before you order your food. You can browse restaurants nearby by visiting the Order Food section in the Explore menu. On this page, you can browse food options and select Start Order when you’ve found what you’re looking for. If the restaurant you want to order from offers takeout or delivery with multiple services, you can select which service you’d like to use. For example, if you have an account with Delivery.com, you can easily order with your existing login. If you don’t have an account with that service, you can quickly and easily sign up, without leaving the Facebook app. We’ve been testing this since last year, and after responding to feedback and adding more partners, we’re rolling out everywhere in the US on iOS, Android and desktop. People will be able to browse restaurants near them that take orders via Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow, Zuppler, EatStreet, Slice, and Olo, as well as directly from restaurants including Papa John’s, Wingstop, Panera, Jack in the Box, TGI Friday’s, Denny’s, El Pollo Loco, Chipotle, Five Guys and Jimmy John’s."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/10/news-feed-fyi-new-test-to-provide-context-about-articles/","date":"2017-10-04T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI"],"title":"New Test to Provide Context About Articles","text":"By Andrew Anker, Sara Su, and Jeff Smith Today we are starting a new test to give people additional context on the articles they see in News Feed. This new feature is designed to provide people some of the tools they need to make an informed decision about which stories to read, share, and trust. It reflects feedback from our community, including many publishers who collaborated on its development as part of our work through the Facebook Journalism Project. For links to articles shared in News Feed, we are testing a button that people can tap to easily access additional information without needing to go elsewhere. The additional contextual information is pulled from across Facebook and other sources, such as information from the publisher’s Wikipedia entry, a button to follow their Page, trending articles or related articles about the topic, and information about how the article is being shared by people on Facebook. In some cases, if that information is unavailable, we will let people know, which can also be helpful context. Helping people access this important contextual information can help them evaluate if articles are from a publisher they trust, and if the story itself is credible. This is just the beginning of the test. We’ll continue to listen to people’s feedback and work with publishers to provide people easy access to the contextual information that helps people decide which stories to read, share, and trust, and to improve the experiences people have on Facebook. How will this impact my page? We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed as a result of this test. As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices and continue to post stories that are relevant to their audiences and that their readers find informative."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/09/blood-donations-in-india/","date":"2017-09-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","India Newsroom","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Introducing a New Feature in India to Help Increase Blood Donations","text":"By Hema Budaraju, Product Manager, Health and Ritesh Mehta, Head of Programs, South Asia India, like many countries, has a shortage of safe blood. There aren’t enough people donating blood to meet the demand of people who need it. In some cases, this shortage leads to patients and their family being responsible for finding donors to replace blood in the blood banks or hospitals. This can cause high-stress situations as people try to find blood donors on their own — including by reaching out to their network on Facebook. We think we can help — by finding ways to more efficiently bring blood donors and people in need together. In India, this drives thousands of people to request blood donors on Facebook each week. Our research suggests that when people have better information and tools, they’re more willing to donate blood — and it’s easier for people who need blood to find donors. That’s why today we’re announcing a new effort to make it easier for people to sign up to be donors and a new way to connect people and organizations with information and tools to find blood donors when needed. We have worked together with nonprofit organizations, health industry experts, potential donors, and people who have used Facebook to find blood donors to ensure that what we are designing will be useful to people in India. Making it Easier to Become a Blood Donor Starting October 1 — National Blood Donor Day — Facebook users in India will be able to start signing up to be blood donors. To help encourage participation, we’ll show a message in News Feed or people can edit their Profiles to sign up. All information will remain private and set to “only me” by default, but people can choose to share their donor status on their timelines. This will first be available on Android and mobile web, as these are the most widely-used platforms in India. Connecting Individuals and Organizations with Blood Donors In the next few weeks, we’ll also make it easier for people and organizations, such as blood banks and hospitals, to connect with blood donors on Facebook. When individuals or organizations are in need of blood, they’ll be able to create a special type of post with all the information donors need to easily offer help. When a request is created, Facebook will automatically notify blood donors who may be nearby to help spread the word. Donors can then review the request and, if they wish to respond, contact the requestor directly through WhatsApp, Messenger or a phone call. The person who needs blood won’t be able to see any information about the donor, unless the donor explicitly provides it when he/she reaches out to the person in need of blood. We hope this new feature helps people come together in ways that weren’t possible before. By raising awareness and growing the number of blood donors in India, we want to make it easier for people and organizations to give and receive blood. People in India can go to facebook.com/donateblood to learn more and sign-up to be a blood donor."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/09/starting-an-open-dialogue-about-race/","date":"2017-09-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Voices","Facebook"],"title":"Starting an Open Dialogue About Race","text":"Be The Bridge creates a safe space for people of different ethnicities to have an open dialogue about race.

As part of this update, we are also introducing links to articles, videos and photos posted publicly by the Facebook community, to help people be more informed about a crisis. Crisis Response on Facebook We have developed a number of crisis response tools, based on what we’ve learned from our community. When there is a crisis, people use Facebook to let their friends and family know they’re safe, learn and share more about what’s happening, and help communities recover. People will be able to access Crisis Response on Facebook in the upcoming weeks from the homepage on desktop or from the menu button on their phone. They will see the following tools when they’re on a crisis page: Safety Check: an easy way to let your friends and family know you’re safe. It will continue to work the same way it does today and will be featured at the top of each crisis page if you are in the affected area. Links to Articles, Photos and Videos: crisis-related content from public posts can help people learn more about a crisis. Community Help: people can ask for and give help to communities affected by the crisis. Fundraisers: let people create fundraisers and donate to support those affected by the crisis and nonprofit organizations helping with relief efforts. Adding More Crisis-Related Content When people receive Safety Check notifications or learn that a crisis has happened, they may not know much about the incident and want to learn more. Starting today, we will begin to include links to articles, photos, and videos from public posts so people have access to more information about a crisis in one place. Safety Check activations and related information may also appear in News Feed to help provide additional details about a crisis. We hope these updates continue to provide people with helpful information to keep them safe and help communities to rebuild and recover."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/08/blocking-ads-from-pages-that-repeatedly-share-false-news/","date":"2017-08-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Blocking Ads From Pages that Repeatedly Share False News","text":"By Satwik Shukla, Product Manager & Tessa Lyons, Product Manager Over the past year we have taken several steps to reduce false news and hoaxes on Facebook. Currently, we do not allow advertisers to run ads that link to stories that have been marked false by third-party fact-checking organizations. Now we are taking an additional step. If Pages repeatedly share stories marked as false, these repeat offenders will no longer be allowed to advertise on Facebook. This update will help to reduce the distribution of false news which will keep Pages that spread false news from making money. We’ve found instances of Pages using Facebook ads to build their audiences in order to distribute false news more broadly. Now, if a Page repeatedly shares stories that have been marked as false by third-party fact-checkers, they will no longer be able to buy ads on Facebook. If Pages stop sharing false news, they may be eligible to start running ads again. False news is harmful to our community. It makes the world less informed and erodes trust. At Facebook, we’re working to fight the spread of false news in three key areas: Disrupting the economic incentives to create false news; Building new products to curb the spread of false news; and Helping people make more informed decisions when they encounter false news.

Many of these moments are reminiscing past memories and moments between friends. Since launching On This Day more than two years ago, we’ve learned that there are many different types of memories and moments that people enjoy revisiting and celebrating, which is why we are excited to share that we’ve added two new ways for people to relive meaningful memories and celebrate special moments on Facebook. Recapping Your Memories We’ve launched a new experience that packages your recent memories in a delightful way for you to enjoy and share. For related recent memories, we will bundle them into a monthly or seasonal memory recap story. Like On This Day, these memory recap stories will show up in News Feed and are shareable. Celebrate Your Friendships We’re launching a new way to celebrate the actions that connect you and your community on Facebook. There are two types of moments where you may see these celebratory messages – when you make a notable number of friends on Facebook, and when your friends have liked your posts. We plan to launch more messages like this in the next few months. Additionally, these messages are currently only shown to you, but will become sharable in the near future. Updates to On This Day and Memory Preferences We’ve received input from people over the past two years and have worked to improve On This Day, such as making controls and preferences easier to access. On This Day is one of Facebook’s most popular experiences and we’re excited that this feature is now available to everyone on Facebook. Finally, we know that occasionally there are some memories that may spark negative feelings that you would rather avoid. We’ve invested a lot in developing ways to filter content that will select photos we believe may be the most relevant and enjoyable to you. We know how much people cherish their friendships and memories, which is why we approach these experiences with sensitivity and care. Our goal is to create a supportive environment that allows you to express your feelings and connect with what matters to you and your community."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/08/news-feed-fyi-taking-action-against-video-clickbait/","date":"2017-08-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Taking Action Against Video Clickbait","text":"By Baraa Hamodi, Engineer, Zahir Bokhari, Engineer, and Yun Zhang, Engineer As part of our ongoing efforts to fight clickbait and improve the integrity of information on Facebook, we are announcing today two updates that will limit the spread of stories in News Feed that feature either fake video play buttons embedded in their imagery or videos of only a static image. People want to see accurate information on Facebook, and so do we. When people click on an image in their News Feed featuring a play button, they expect a video to start playing. Spammers often use fake play buttons to trick people into clicking links to low quality websites. Similarly, these deceptive spammers also use static images disguised as videos to trick people into clicking on a low quality experience. To limit this, during the coming weeks we will begin demoting stories that feature fake video play buttons and static images disguised as videos in News Feed. Authentic communication is one of our core News Feed values, and we know our community values it. How Will This Impact My Page? Publishers that rely on these intentionally deceptive practices should expect the distribution of those clickbait stories to markedly decrease.

We’re excited to announce two new birthday experiences that we hope will make birthdays even more meaningful while you’re celebrating on Facebook. Giving Back On Your Birthday People often dedicate their birthday to support a cause, and we’ve seen people using Facebook to raise money for causes they care about. For those in the US, we’re now making it easier to do this by giving you the opportunity to create a fundraiser for your birthday directly on Facebook. Two weeks before your birthday, you’ll see a message from Facebook in your News Feed giving you the option to create a fundraiser for your birthday. You can create a fundraiser for any of the 750,000 US nonprofits available for fundraising on Facebook. Your friends will receive a notification inviting them to support your cause in honor of your special day. Wish Your Best Friends Happy Birthday With a Video We wanted to make birthdays even more special by giving people the opportunity to share a birthday wish with a close friend on their special day, which is why we’ve introduced shareable birthday videos made especially for you and your close friends. These videos will be shown to you on the day of a close friend’s birthday, and like our other personalized videos, we created these videos because we wanted to make the birthday experience on Facebook even more fun for the special relationships in your life.

Better Conversations We’re always working to help people have more lively and expressive conversations on Facebook. More and more, comments have become the way to have conversations about a post with other people.

Today we’re sharing additional steps we’ve taken to remove even more of them from Facebook, so that what people see after clicking an ad or post matches their expectations. Some of the worst offenders use a technique known as “cloaking” to circumvent Facebook’s review processes and show content to people that violates Facebook’s Community Standards and Advertising Policies. Here, these bad actors disguise the true destination of an ad or post, or the real content of the destination page, in order to bypass Facebook’s review processes. For example, they will set up web pages so that when a Facebook reviewer clicks a link to check whether it’s consistent with our policies, they are taken to a different web page than when someone using the Facebook app clicks that same link. Cloaked destination pages, which frequently include diet pills, pornography and muscle building scams, create negative and disruptive experiences for people. Since cloaking exists across many of today’s digital platforms, we will also be collaborating closely with other companies in the industry to find new ways to combat it and punish bad actors. Over the past few months we have been ramping up our enforcement across ads, posts and Pages, and have strengthened our policies to explicitly call out this practice. We will ban advertisers or Pages found to be cloaking from the platform. How We Identify Cloaking We are utilizing artificial intelligence and have expanded our human review processes to help us identify, capture, and verify cloaking. We can now better observe differences in the type of content served to people using our apps compared to our own internal systems. In the past few months these new steps have resulted in us taking down thousands of these offenders and disrupting their economic incentives for misleading people. How Will This Impact My Page? We see cloaking as deliberate and deceptive, and will not tolerate it on Facebook. We will remove Pages that engage in cloaking. Otherwise Pages should not see changes to their referral traffic."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/08/introducing-watch-a-new-platform-for-shows-on-facebook/","date":"2017-08-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Watch, a New Platform For Shows On Facebook","text":"By Daniel Danker, Director of Product Update on 8/31: Over the next few days, Watch will be broadly available to people in the U.S. We’re excited to see how the community engages with shows – there will be hundreds to choose from — and we look forward to bringing the experience to more people in the future. Watching video on Facebook has the incredible power to connect people, spark conversation, and foster community. On Facebook, videos are discovered through friends and bring communities together. As more and more people enjoy this experience, we’ve learned that people like the serendipity of discovering videos in News Feed, but they also want a dedicated place they can go to watch videos. That’s why last year we launched the Video tab in the US, which offered a predictable place to find videos on Facebook. Now we want to make it even easier to catch up with shows you love. Introducing Watch We’re introducing Watch, a new platform for shows on Facebook. Watch will be available on mobile, on desktop and laptop, and in our TV apps. Shows are made up of episodes — live or recorded — and follow a theme or storyline. To help you keep up with the shows you follow, Watch has a Watchlist so you never miss out on the latest episodes. Watch is personalized to help you discover new shows, organized around what your friends and communities are watching. For example, you’ll find sections like “Most Talked About,” which highlights shows that spark conversation, “What’s Making People Laugh,” which includes shows where many people have used the Haha reaction, and “What Friends Are Watching,” which helps you connect with friends about shows they too are following. We’ve learned from Facebook Live that people’s comments and reactions to a video are often as much a part of the experience as the video itself. So when you watch a show, you can see comments and connect with friends and other viewers while watching, or participate in a dedicated Facebook Group for the show. A Platform for Shows Watch is a platform for all creators and publishers to find an audience, build a community of passionate fans, and earn money for their work. We think a wide variety of Facebook shows can be successful, particularly: Shows that engage fans and community. Nas Daily publishes a daily show where he makes videos together with his fans from around the world. The Watchlist makes it easy for fans to catch every day’s new episode. Live shows that connect directly with fans. Gabby Bernstein, a New York Times bestselling author, motivational speaker, and life coach, uses a combination of recorded and live episodes to connect with her fans and answer questions in real time. Shows that follow a narrative arc or have a consistent theme. Tastemade’s Kitchen Little is a funny show about kids who watch a how-to video of a recipe, then instruct professional chefs on how to make it. Each episode features a new child, a new chef, and a new recipe. Unsurprisingly, the food doesn’t always turn out as expected. Live events that bring communities together. Major League Baseball is broadcasting a game a week on Facebook, enabling people to watch live baseball while connecting with friends and fellow fans on the platform. We think Watch will be home to a wide range of shows, from reality to comedy to live sports. To help inspire creators and seed the ecosystem, we’ve also funded some shows that are examples of community-oriented and episodic video series. For example, Returning the Favor is a series hosted by Mike Rowe where he finds people doing something extraordinary for their community, tells the world about it, and in turn does something extraordinary for them. Candidates are nominated by Mike’s fans on Facebook. We’re excited to see how creators and publishers use shows to connect with their fans and community. You can learn more about making shows on our Media blog. We’ll be introducing Watch to a limited group of people in the US and plan to bring the experience to more people soon. Similarly, we’ll be opening up shows to a limited group of creators and plan to roll out to all soon."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/08/news-feed-fyi-showing-you-stories-that-link-to-faster-loading-webpages/","date":"2017-08-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Showing You Stories That Link to Faster Loading Webpages","text":"Update on March 5, 2021 at 09:00AM PT: We are continuing this effort today on iOS by letting people know when a link is likely to load slowly relative to their connection type and region. Originally published on August 2, 2017: We’re always listening to our community to understand how we can improve their experience of News Feed. We’ve heard from people that it’s frustrating to click on a link that leads to a slow-loading webpage. In fact, even more broadly on the internet, we’ve found that when people have to wait for a site to load for too long, they abandon what they were clicking on all together. As many as 40 percent of website visitors abandon a site after three seconds of delay. During the coming months we’re making an update to News Feed to show people more stories that will load quickly on mobile and fewer stories that might take longer to load, so they can spend more time reading the stories they find relevant. Taking Loading Time Into Account With this update, we’ll soon take into account the estimated load time of a webpage that someone clicks to from any link in News Feed on the mobile app. Factors such as the person’s current network connection and the general speed of the corresponding webpage will be considered. If signals indicate the webpage will load quickly, the link to that webpage might appear higher in your feed. For years, we have taken many factors into account to make sure people quickly see relevant stories to them — including the type of device you’re on or the speed of your mobile network or wifi connection. For example, if you are on a slower internet connection that won’t load videos, News Feed will show you fewer videos and more status updates and links. And to help load stories faster for people on slow or poor network connections, we prefetch stories by downloading mobile content before someone clicks a link, which we’ve seen can shorten load time for webpages by more than 25%. Will This Impact My Page? This update will roll out gradually over the coming months. We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed. Webpages that are particularly slow could see decreases in referral traffic. To help webpages avoid experiencing potential decreases, we’re sharing tips to help site owners make their site faster and more mobile-friendly. See here for publisher best practices for improving mobile site load time. As always, publishers should keep in mind these basic guideposts to reach their audience on Facebook and continue to post stories that are relevant to their audiences and that their readers find informative."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/news-feed-fyi-showing-more-informative-links-in-news-feed/","date":"2017-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Showing More Informative Links in News Feed","text":"By Adam Mosseri, VP, News Feed Today we are making an update to help reduce low quality links in News Feed. We are always working to improve people’s experience in News Feed by showing more stories that we think people will find informative and entertaining. Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people’s feeds. Our research further shows that the links they share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait, sensationalism, and misinformation. As a result, we want to reduce the influence of these spammers and deprioritize the links they share more frequently than regular sharers. Of course, this is only one signal among many others that may affect the ranking prioritization of this type of post. This update will only apply to links, such as an individual article, not to domains, Pages, videos, photos, check-ins or status updates. One of our core News Feed values is that News Feed should be informative. By taking steps like this to improve News Feed, we’re able to surface more stories that people find informative and reduce the spread of problematic links such as clickbait, sensationalism and misinformation. Will This Impact My Page? Most publishers won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed. Publishers that get meaningful distribution from people who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day may see a reduction in the distribution of those specific links.

In India, we’ve heard that people want more control over their profile pictures, and we’ve been working over the past year to understand how we can help. Today, we are piloting new tools that give people in India more control over who can download and share their profile pictures. In addition, we’re exploring ways people can more easily add designs to profile pictures, which our research has shown helpful in deterring misuse. Based on what we learn from our experience in India, we hope to expand to other countries soon. Profile pictures are an important part of building community on Facebook because they help people find friends and create meaningful connections. But not everyone feels safe adding a profile picture. In our research with people and safety organizations in India, we’ve heard that some women choose not to share profile pictures that include their faces anywhere on the internet because they’re concerned about what may happen to their photos. These tools, developed in partnership with Indian safety organizations like Centre for Social Research, Learning Links Foundation, Breakthrough and Youth Ki Awaaz, are designed to give people more control over their experience and help keep them safe online. New Controls People in India will start seeing a step-by-step guide to add an optional profile picture guard. When you add this guard: Other people will no longer be able to download, share or send your profile picture in a message on Facebook People you’re not friends with on Facebook won’t be able to tag anyone, including themselves, in your profile picture Where possible, we’ll prevent others from taking a screenshot of your profile picture on Facebook, which is currently available only on Android devices We’ll display a blue border and shield around your profile picture as a visual cue of protection Deterring Misuse Based on preliminary tests, we’ve learned that when someone adds an extra design layer to their profile picture, other people are at least 75% less likely to copy that picture. We partnered with Jessica Singh, an illustrator who took inspiration from traditional Indian textile designs such as bandhani and kantha, to create designs for people to add to their profile picture. If someone suspects that a picture marked with one of these designs is being misused, they can report it to Facebook and we will use the design to help determine whether it should be removed from our community."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/announcing-updates-to-safety-check/","date":"2017-06-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Safety & Expression","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Announcing Updates to Safety Check","text":"By Naomi Gleit, VP Social Good As part of our ongoing commitment to build a safe community, today we’re announcing several updates to Safety Check: Introducing Fundraisers in Safety Check: people in the US will have the option to start a fundraiser from within Safety Check Expanding Community Help: Community Help will be available on desktop and for all crisis types where Safety Check is activated Adding more context with a personal note: now people can share a personal note in their Safety Check News Feed story with friends and loved ones Introducing crisis descriptions: get more information about a crisis from NC4, our trusted third party global crisis reporting agency, within the Safety Check tool Introducing Fundraisers in Safety Check Following a crisis, one way people give and request help is through fundraising. To make this easier, we are introducing Fundraisers in Safety Check. Within Safety Check, people will be able to create or donate to a fundraiser for charitable and personal causes to help those in need. Fundraising provides a way for people who are also outside of the crisis area to offer help. Fundraisers in Safety Check will start to roll out in the coming weeks in the US. Expanding Community Help Since we launched Community Help earlier this year on iOS and Android, we have been inspired by the offers and requests for help generated by the community and want to make sure that those in need are able to access Community Help through any platform. Community Help will be available in the upcoming weeks on desktop, giving people another way to access the tool. Additionally, Community Help is now available for all crises where Safety Check is activated. Adding more context with a personal note After marking themselves safe, people share additional information to help reassure friends they are safe and to provide more context about the crisis. To make this easier, people can now add a personal note to tell their friends more about what’s happening from within the Safety Check tool. This note will appear in the News Feed story that is automatically generated when people mark themselves safe. Introducing crisis descriptions When people receive Safety Check notifications, they may have limited information about the crisis. To help provide additional context on crises and make sure people have the information that they need, we have started adding descriptions about the crisis from NC4, our trusted third party global crisis reporting agency. Safety Check has been activated more than 600 times in two years and has notified people that their families and friends are safe more than a billion times. Keeping the community safe means everything to us at Facebook and we hope that these updates to Safety Check continue to do just that."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/making-facebook-live-more-accessible-with-closed-captions/","date":"2017-06-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Making Facebook Live More Accessible With Closed Captions","text":"By Supratik Lahiri, Product Manager, and Jeffrey Wieland, Director of Accessibility Making Facebook accessible to everyone is a key part of building global community.

You’ve always been able to click on a topic to see related posts and stories, but we’ve redesigned the page to make it easier to discover other publications that are covering the story, as well as what your friends and public figures are saying about it. You’ll be able to see the new results page on iPhone in the US, and we plan to make it available on Android and desktop soon. Now, when you click on a Trending topic, you’ll see a carousel with stories from other publications about a given topic that you can swipe through. By making it easier to see what other news outlets are saying about each topic, we hope that people will feel more informed about the news in their region. The stories that appear in this section are some of the most popular stories about that topic on Facebook. These stories are determined the same way as the featured headline — using a combination of factors including the engagement around the article on Facebook, the engagement around the publisher overall, and whether other articles are linking to it. There is no predetermined list of publications that are eligible to appear in Trending and this update does not affect how Trending topics are identified, which we announced earlier this year. Making Trending Easier to Discover On Mobile One of the things we regularly hear from people who use Trending is that it can be difficult to find in the Facebook mobile app. We’re soon beginning a test in News Feed that will show people the top three Trending stories, which they can click on to see the full list of Trending topics and explore what people are discussing on Facebook. While most people will not see Trending in their News Feed as part of this small test, we hope that it will help us learn how to make Trending as useful and informative for people as possible. If you do see the Trending unit in your News Feed, you have the option to remove it in the drop-down menu which will prevent it from being shown to you in the future. As before, we continue to listen to feedback about Trending and will keep making improvements in order to provide a valuable experience."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/05/expanding-facebook-fundraisers-to-more-people-and-causes/","date":"2017-05-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Expanding Facebook Fundraisers to More People and Causes","text":"By Naomi Gleit, VP Social Good Facebook is a place where people come together to connect with their communities and support one another in meaningful ways. Today, we are giving people another way to mobilize around causes they care about by expanding personal fundraisers to everyone over 18 in the US and by adding two new categories – community and sports. We began testing personal fundraisers, a new product that allows people to raise money for a friend, themselves or a sick pet directly on Facebook, in March. Since then, we’ve been inspired by the response to create them and the support felt by those they benefit. People can create a fundraiser to quickly raise money on Facebook and easily reach their friends in a few taps, without leaving Facebook, and can share fundraisers to help build momentum. People can learn about the person who created the fundraiser and the person benefiting from the fundraiser, as well as see which friends have donated. Now people can raise money for any of the following categories: Education: such as tuition, books or classroom supplies Medical: such as medical procedures, treatments or injuries Pet Medical: such as veterinary procedures, treatments or injuries Crisis Relief: such as public crises or natural disasters Personal Emergency: such as a house fire, theft or car accident Funeral and Loss: such as burial expenses or living costs after losing a loved one Sports: such as equipment, competitions or team fees Community: such as neighborhood services, community improvements or environmental improvements Nonprofit fundraisers continue to be available for people on Facebook to raise funds and awareness for 501(c)(3) nonprofits. It’s easy to get started: On mobile, tap the menu icon and select Fundraisers, or on desktop, go to facebook.com/fundraisers Choose to raise money for a Friend, Yourself or Someone or Something Not on Facebook Give your fundraiser a title and compelling story, and start raising money All fundraisers are reviewed within 24 hours. Personal fundraisers are available on all devices, and have a 6.9% + $0.30 fee that goes to payment processing, fundraiser vetting, and security and fraud protection. Facebook’s goal is to create a platform for good that’s sustainable over the long-term, and not to make a profit from our charitable giving tools.

We know Facebook Live is better with friends. We’ve been working on ways to make Live more fun, social and interactive, like with the new Live interactive effects we announced last month. Today we’re excited to announce two new features that make it easier to share experiences and connect in real time with your friends on Live. Live Chat With Friends One of the best things about Live is that you can discuss what’s happening in the broadcast in real time. In fact, people comment more than 10 times more on Facebook Live videos than on regular videos. When it comes to compelling public broadcasts — such as a breaking news event, a Q&A with your favorite actor or behind-the-scenes action after a big game — watching with the community and reading comments is an exciting part of the experience. We know sometimes people also want the option to interact with only their friends during a public live broadcast, so we’re rolling out Live Chat With Friends. Live Chat With Friends lets you invite friends to a private chat about a public live broadcast. You can invite friends who are already watching or other friends who you think may want to tune in. You’re able to jump back into the public conversation at any time, and you can still continue chatting with your friends via Messenger after the broadcast ends. With Live Chat With Friends, you can be part of big moments with the wider community but also have the option to participate in personal conversations with the people closest to you, directly within the Live experience. We’re testing this feature on mobile in several countries, and we look forward to making it available more broadly later this summer. Live With Last year we started rolling out the ability for public figures to go live with a guest. Now available for all profiles and Pages on iOS, Live With lets you invite a friend into your live video so you can hang out together, even if you’re not in the same place. Sharing the screen with a friend can make going live more fun and interactive — for both you and your viewers. To invite a friend to join you in your live video, simply select a guest from the Live Viewers section, or tap a comment from the viewer you want to invite. Your viewer can then choose whether or not to join your broadcast. You can go live with a guest in both portrait mode (for a picture-in-picture experience) and landscape mode (for a side-by-side experience). For a full tutorial, click here. We’re excited to see how people use these Facebook Live features to come together around moments big and small."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/05/facebooks-community-standards-how-and-where-we-draw-the-line/","date":"2017-05-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Facebook’s Community Standards: How and Where We Draw the Line","text":"By Monika Bickert, Head of Global Policy Management Last month, people shared several horrific videos on Facebook of Syrian children in the aftermath of a chemical weapons attack. The videos, which also appeared elsewhere on the internet, showed the children shaking, struggling to breathe and eventually dying. The images were deeply shocking – so much so that we placed a warning screen in front of them. But the images also prompted international outrage and renewed attention on the plight of Syrians. Reviewing online material on a global scale is challenging and essential. As the person in charge of doing this work for Facebook, I want to explain how and where we draw the line. On an average day, more than a billion people use Facebook. They share posts in dozens of languages: everything from photos to live videos. A very small percentage of those will be reported to us for investigation. The range of issues is broad – from bullying and hate speech to terrorism – and complex. Designing policies that both keep people safe and enable them to share freely means understanding emerging social issues and the way they manifest themselves online, and being able to respond quickly to millions of reports a week from people all over the world. For our reviewers, there is another hurdle: understanding context. It’s hard to judge the intent behind one post, or the risk implied in another. Someone posts a graphic video of a terrorist attack. Will it inspire people to emulate the violence, or speak out against it? Someone posts a joke about suicide. Are they just being themselves, or is it a cry for help? In the UK, being critical of the monarchy might be acceptable. In some parts of the world it will get you a jail sentence. Laws can provide guidance, but often what’s acceptable is more about norms and expectations. New ways to tell stories and share images can bring these tensions to the surface faster than ever. We aim to keep our site safe. We don’t always share the details of our policies, because we don’t want to encourage people to find workarounds – but we do publish our Community Standards, which set out what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook, and why. Our standards change over time. We are in constant dialogue with experts and local organizations, on everything from child safety to terrorism to human rights. Sometimes this means our policies can seem counterintuitive. As the Guardian reported, experts in self-harm advised us that it can be better to leave live videos of self-harm running so that people can be alerted to help, but to take them down afterwards to prevent copycats. When a girl in Georgia, USA, attempted suicide on Facebook Live two weeks ago, her friends were able to notify police, who managed to reach her in time. We try hard to stay objective. The cases we review aren’t the easy ones: they are often in a grey area where people disagree. Art and pornography aren’t always easily distinguished, but we’ve found that digitally generated images of nudity are more likely to be pornographic than handmade ones, so our policy reflects that. There’s a big difference between general expressions of anger and specific calls for a named individual to be harmed, so we allow the former but don’t permit the latter. These tensions – between raising awareness of violence and promoting it, between freedom of expression and freedom from fear, between bearing witness to something and gawking at it – are complicated, and there are rarely universal legal standards to provide clarity. Being as objective as possible is the only way we can be consistent across the world. But we still sometimes end up making the wrong call. The hypothetical situations we use to train reviewers are intentionally extreme. They’re designed to help the people who do this work deal with the most difficult cases. When we first created our content standards nearly a decade ago, much was left to the discretion of individual employees. But because no two people will have identical views of what defines hate speech or bullying – or any number of other issues – we now include clear definitions. We face criticism from people who want more censorship and people who want less. We see that as a useful signal that we are not leaning too far in any one direction. I hope that readers will understand that we take our role extremely seriously. For many of us on the team within Facebook, safety is a passion that predates our work at the company: I spent more than a decade as a criminal prosecutor, investigating everything from child sexual exploitation to terrorism. Our team also includes a counter extremism expert from the UK, the former research director of West Point’s Combating Terrorism Center, a rape crisis center worker, and a teacher. All of us know there is more we can do. Last month, we announced that we are hiring an extra 3,000 reviewers. This is demanding work, and we will continue to do more to ensure we are giving them the right support, both by making it easier to escalate hard decisions quickly and by providing the psychological support they need. Technology has given more people more power to communicate more widely than ever before. We believe the benefits of sharing far outweigh the risks. But we also recognize that society is still figuring out what is acceptable and what is harmful, and that we, at Facebook, can play an important part of that conversation."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/05/news-feed-fyi-new-updates-to-reduce-clickbait-headlines/","date":"2017-05-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI"],"title":"New Updates to Reduce Clickbait Headlines","text":"By Arun Babu, Engineer, Annie Liu, Engineer, and Jordan Zhang, Engineer People tell us they don’t like stories that are misleading, sensational or spammy. That includes clickbait headlines that are designed to get attention and lure visitors into clicking on a link. In an effort to support an informed community, we’re always working to determine what stories might have clickbait headlines so we can show them less often. Last year we made an update to News Feed to reduce stories from sources that consistently post clickbait headlines that withhold and exaggerate information. Today, we are making three updates that build on this work so that people will see even fewer clickbait stories in their feeds, and more of the stories they find authentic. First, we are now taking into account clickbait at the individual post level in addition to the domain and Page level, in order to more precisely reduce clickbait headlines. Second, in order to make this more effective, we are dividing our efforts into two separate signals — so we will now look at whether a headline withholds information or if it exaggerates information separately. Third, we are starting to test this work in additional languages. How We Are Improving Our Efforts One of our News Feed values is authentic communication, so we’ve been working to understand what people find authentic and what people do not. We’ve learned from last year’s update that we can better detect different kinds of clickbait headlines by separately — rather than jointly — identifying signals that withhold or exaggerate information. Headlines that withhold information intentionally leave out crucial details or mislead people, forcing them to click to find out the answer. For example, “When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw THIS…” Headlines that exaggerate the details of a story with sensational language tend to make the story seem like a bigger deal than it really is. For example, “WOW! Ginger tea is the secret to everlasting youth. You’ve GOT to see this!” We addressed this similarly to how we previously worked to reduce clickbait: We categorized hundreds of thousands of headlines as clickbait or not clickbait by considering if the headline exaggerates the details of a story, and separately if the headline withholds information. A team at Facebook reviewed thousands of headlines using these criteria, validating each other’s work to identify large sets of clickbait headlines. From there, we identify what phrases are commonly used in clickbait headlines that are not used in other headlines. This is similar to how many email spam filters work. Posts with clickbait headlines will appear lower in News Feed. We will continue to learn over time, and we hope to continue expanding this work to reduce clickbait in even more languages. Will This Impact My Page? We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed as a result of this update. Publishers that rely on clickbait headlines should expect their distribution to decrease. Pages should avoid headlines that withhold information required to understand the content of the article and headlines that exaggerate the article to create misleading expectations. If a Page stops posting clickbait and sensational headlines, their posts will stop being impacted by this change. As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices. We will learn from these changes and will continue to work on reducing clickbait so News Feed is a place for authentic communication. Update, 7/11/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new languages, including Romanian, Turkish, Russian, Bulgarian, Dutch, Greek, Hungarian, and Hindi. Update, 12/4/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new languages, including Indonesian and Bengali."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/05/reducing-links-to-low-quality-web-page-experiences/","date":"2017-05-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Reducing Links to Low-Quality Web Page Experiences","text":"By Jiun-Ren Lin and Shengbo Guo We want to help people build an informed community on Facebook. That’s why we’re always working to understand which posts people consider misleading, sensational and spammy so we can show fewer of those and show more informative posts instead. We hear from our community that they’re disappointed when they click on a link that leads to a web page containing little substantive content and that is covered in disruptive, shocking or malicious ads. People expect their experience after clicking on a post to be straightforward. Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so people see fewer posts and ads in News Feed that link to these low-quality web page experiences. Similar to the work we’re already doing to stop misinformation, this update will help reduce the economic incentives of financially-motivated spammers. A More Informative Experience We have had a policy in place since last year to prevent advertisers with low-quality web page experiences from advertising on our platform. Now, we are increasing enforcement on ads and also taking into account organic posts in News Feed. With this update, we reviewed hundreds of thousands of web pages linked to from Facebook to identify those that contain little substantive content and have a large number of disruptive, shocking or malicious ads. We then used artificial intelligence to understand whether new web pages shared on Facebook have similar characteristics. So if we determine a post might link to these types of low-quality web pages, it may show up lower in people’s feeds and may not be eligible to be an ad. This way people can see fewer misleading posts and more informative posts. Will This Impact My Page or Ad Account? These changes will roll out gradually over the coming months. Publishers that do not have the type of low-quality landing page experience referenced may see a small increase in traffic, while publishers who do should see a decline in traffic. This update is one of many signals we use to rank News Feed, so impact will vary by publisher, and Pages should continue posting stories their audiences will like. For advertisers and publishers looking for tips on how to improve their web experiences, please read the full Facebook Business post and visit our Help Center. Update October 16, 2018: Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so people see fewer posts that link out to low-quality sites that predominantly copy and republish content from other sites without providing unique value.

This includes helping people have conversations about the news and giving people more ways to see a more complete picture of a story or topic. This work is important to us, so we’re building new products and exploring ways to improve our existing ones. In 2013, we launched Related Articles to help people discover new articles they may find interesting about the same topic. These articles appear in News Feed after people read an article. Today, we’re beginning to test Related Articles that might appear before you read an article shared in News Feed. These additional articles, which appear for topics many people are talking about on Facebook, will appear in a unit below the link. That should provide people easier access to additional perspectives and information, including articles by third-party fact checkers. For example, during an instance when a lot of people are discussing an article about a new medical advancement, we may also show you a few other articles below it from different publishers about the same medical topic. This is one of many tests we’re working on to improve the experiences people have on Facebook. We will learn from the test, and apply what we learn to improve the product for everyone. Update: August 3, 2017: Rolling Out Related Articles More Broadly Since starting this test, we’ve heard that Related Articles helps give people more perspectives and additional information, and helps them determine whether the news they are reading is misleading or false. So we’re rolling this out more broadly. Now, we will start using updated machine learning to detect more potential hoaxes to send to third-party fact checkers. If an article has been reviewed by fact checkers, we may show the fact checking stories below the original post. In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share. We will continue testing updates to Related Articles and other ongoing News Feed efforts to show less false news on Facebook and provide people context if they see false news. How Will This Impact My Page? We don’t anticipate Pages will see significant changes in reach. Pages should continue posting stories that are relevant to their audience."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/04/a-new-educational-tool-against-misinformation/","date":"2017-04-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Integrity & Security","Product News"],"title":"A New Educational Tool Against Misinformation","text":"By Adam Mosseri, VP, News Feed We know people want to see accurate information on Facebook – and so do we. False news and hoaxes are harmful to our community and make the world less informed. All of us have a responsibility to curb the spread of false news. At Facebook we have been focusing on three key areas: disrupting economic incentives because most false news is financially motivated; building new products to curb the spread of false news; and helping people make more informed decisions when they encounter false news. As part of our ongoing efforts, we’ve worked in consultation with First Draft, a non-profit dedicated to improving skills and standards in the reporting and sharing of information online, to roll out an educational tool to help people spot false news. We’re featuring this tool at the top of News Feed for a few days to people on Facebook in 14 countries. When people click on this educational tool at the top of their News Feed, they will see more information and resources in the Facebook Help Center, including tips on how to spot false news, such as checking the URL of the site, investigating the source and looking for other reports on the topic. News Feed is a place for authentic communication. Improving news literacy is a global priority, and we need to do our part to help people understand how to make decisions about which sources to trust. False news runs counter to our mission to connect people with the stories they find meaningful. We will continue working on this and we know we have more work to do."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/03/more-ways-to-support-causes/","date":"2017-03-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"More Ways to Support Causes","text":"By Naomi Gleit, VP Social Good When people mobilize around the causes they care about, it builds a safe and supportive community. Our charitable giving tools have made it easy for people to raise millions of dollars for nonprofits to support those in need directly on Facebook. Today we are expanding those tools to include personal fundraisers, as well as more options for people to continue to fundraise for nonprofits. Introducing Personal Fundraisers Personal fundraisers allow people to raise money for themselves, a friend or someone or something not on Facebook, for example a pet. Personal fundraisers will launch in the US for people aged 18 years or older, and in beta over the next few weeks, as we hope to continue to learn and improve the product to make it even more useful. For example, we will begin with six specific categories for critical financial needs and include a 24-hour fundraiser review process. As we learn more, we hope to expand our categories and automate more of the review process. Personal fundraisers will have a 6.9% + $.30 fee, that will go to payment processing fees, fundraiser vetting, security and fraud protection. Facebook’s goal is to create a platform for good that’s sustainable over the long-term, and not to make a profit from our charitable giving tools. Your personal fundraiser can raise money to cover costs related to: Education: such as tuition, books or classroom supplies Medical: such as medical procedures, treatments or injuries Pet Medical: such as veterinary procedures, treatments or injuries Crisis Relief: such as public crises or natural disasters Personal Emergency: such as a house fire, theft or car accident Funeral and Loss: such as burial expenses or living costs after losing a loved one Personal fundraisers allow people to reach friends where they already are to quickly build momentum for their cause. Friends can donate in a few taps with secure payments, without leaving Facebook. Since you can see real profiles on Facebook, donors will see how they are connected to the person who created the fundraiser, the person benefiting and others who are supporting the fundraiser. Donate Buttons in Facebook Live for Pages In 2016, we made it possible for people to raise money for more than 750,000 nonprofits through fundraisers, and donate buttons in their live broadcasts and posts. Today, we’re announcing that verified Pages can now add donate buttons to their live broadcasts. This gives public figures, brands, businesses and organizations new ways to fundraise on Facebook for the nonprofits they support. People watching the live broadcast can donate as they watch, or give once the broadcast has ended and is posted on the Page. We’re constantly inspired by all the good done by people on Facebook and are committed to building tools that help build a supportive and safe global community."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/03/more-ways-to-share-with-the-facebook-camera/","date":"2017-03-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"More Ways to Share With the Facebook Camera","text":"By Connor Hayes, Product Manager Update on August 15, 2017:  Over the past few months, we’ve seen people use the Facebook Camera and its creative effects to show friends and family what they’re up to. Today, we’re rolling out new ways to capture and share moments with the Facebook Camera on iOS and Android devices: Live: Go live from the Facebook Camera and use Camera’s creative effects for Facebook Live, too. When live, your video will appear in your Story to the audience you’ve selected. You can go live in just your Story or choose to also create a Post to your Timeline. Learn more here. GIF: Bring pictures to life by creating 2-second looping videos from the Facebook Camera. You’ll be able to share to News Feed, your Story or Direct. Text: Make text updates more visual with full-screen text posts that include a colored background with text on top. You’ll be able to share to News Feed, your Story or Direct. Originally published on March 28, 2017: We want to make it fast, fun and easy for people to share creative photos and videos with whomever they choose, for however long they choose — and the more we share with each other, the more open and connected our community can be. Today we’re starting to roll out a new camera with effects and two additional ways to share the photos and videos you take. Camera Effects: Let Your Camera Do the Talking Starting this week on iOS and Android, you can tap on the camera icon on the top left corner of the Facebook app or swipe right from News Feed to try out the new in-app camera. The Facebook camera is packed with dozens of effects like masks, frames and interactive filters that you can apply to your photos and videos. Reactive effects let you interact with dynamic objects — like falling snow — and style effects apply an artistic filter to your video in real time, letting you turn your everyday selfie into a Picasso-style work of art. We’re also partnering with brands to create masks for upcoming movies Alien: Covenant, Despicable Me 3, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Power Rangers, Smurfs: The Lost Village and Wonder Woman. Masks for Alien: Covenant (left), Despicable Me 3 (middle) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (right) Masks for Power Rangers (middle), Smurfs: The Lost Village (left) and Wonder Woman (right) Additionally, we’re including guest art from visual artists like Douglas Coupland and Hattie Stewart. We’ll regularly refresh the creative effects in the camera to give you fun new effects to explore. Stories: Show Friends What You’re Up To The Instagram community has shown us that it can be fun to share things that disappear after a day, so in the main Facebook app we’re also introducing Facebook Stories, which lets you share multiple photos and videos as part of a visual collection atop News Feed. Your friends can view photos or videos from your story for 24 hours, and stories won’t appear on your Timeline or in News Feed unless you post them there, too. To add to your story, tap on the “Your Story” icon in the Stories bar at the top of News Feed.Direct: Easily Share With Exactly Who You Want In addition to sharing to your Story, we know you may want to share your photos and videos with specific friends. We’ve also added Direct, an option that’s designed for sharing individual photos and videos with specific friends for a limited time. When you send a photo or video via Direct, your friends will be able to view it once and replay it or write a reply. Once the conversation on the photo or video ends, the content is no longer visible in Direct.Over the coming months, we plan to introduce new ways for the Facebook community to create their own frames and effects that can be used on any photo or video created with the new Facebook camera. Our goal is for the camera to be a home to hundreds of dynamic and fun effects that give you new ways to connect with friends, family, and your community. We hope that with the new Facebook camera, Stories and Direct, it will be easier than ever to see the world through each other’s eyes, and we can’t wait to see the photos and videos you create.

We’re excited to announce that, as of today, people around the world can broadcast live video to Facebook from their desktop or laptop computers. While it’s been possible for people to go live to Facebook from mobile devices since last year, desktop or laptop computers provide a stable camera setup that can be beneficial to many types of Facebook Live broadcasts — from Q&As to vlogs to tutorials to any broadcast from someone who isn’t on the move. To get started on your live broadcast from a computer, click “Live Video” from the top of your News Feed or Timeline, then follow the prompts to add a description and choose your audience. Go Live with Streaming Software We’ve also added a new feature that makes it easy to use streaming software or external hardware when going live from a computer. This capability previously was possible only through a Page, but we’ve heard feedback from our community that it would be useful for profiles, too. With this update, people can seamlessly share their screens, insert graphics, switch cameras, or use professional equipment in Facebook Live videos. They also have the option to broadcast to Facebook Groups they belong to, Facebook Events they’re part of, or Facebook Pages they manage. If you’re a gamer, this new feature makes it easier than ever to stream your PC gameplay to friends and followers and engage with them while you play. If you’re giving your friends or followers a tutorial or how-to guide, you can incorporate on-screen graphics, titles, and overlays. Or if you’re an artist, you can go live and switch seamlessly between cameras as you narrate the process. You can go live with streaming software or external hardware directly from News Feed, your profile, or the direct link here. Check out this step-by-step guide. We want to make Facebook Live as enjoyable and interactive as possible, and we hope these updates will make it easier for people to connect, hang out, and share with friends and public audiences."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/03/building-a-safer-community-with-new-suicide-prevention-tools/","date":"2017-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Safety & Expression"],"title":"Building a Safer Community With New Suicide Prevention Tools","text":"By Vanessa Callison-Burch, Product Manager, Jennifer Guadagno, Researcher, and Antigone Davis, Head of Global Safety There is one death by suicide in the world every 40 seconds, and suicide is the second leading cause of death for 15-29 year olds. Experts say that one of the best ways to prevent suicide is for those in distress to hear from people who care about them. Facebook is in a unique position — through friendships on the site — to help connect a person in distress with people who can support them. It’s part of our ongoing effort to help build a safe community on and off Facebook. Today we’re updating the tools and resources we offer to people who may be thinking of suicide, as well as the support we offer to their concerned friends and family members: Integrated suicide prevention tools to help people in real time on Facebook Live Live chat support from crisis support organizations through Messenger Streamlined reporting for suicide, assisted by artificial intelligence Already on Facebook if someone posts something that makes you concerned about their well-being, you can reach out to them directly or report the post to us. We have teams working around the world, 24/7, who review reports that come in and prioritize the most serious reports like suicide. We provide people who have expressed suicidal thoughts with a number of support options. For example, we prompt people to reach out to a friend and even offer pre-populated text to make it easier for people to start a conversation. We also suggest contacting a help line and offer other tips and resources for people to help themselves in that moment. Suicide prevention tools have been available on Facebook for more than 10 years and were developed in collaboration with mental health organizations such as Save.org, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Forefront and Crisis Text Line, and with input from people who have personal experience thinking about or attempting suicide. In 2016 we expanded the availability of the latest tools globally — with the help of over 70 partners around the world — and improved how they work based on new technology and feedback from the community. Supporting Someone on Facebook Live Our suicide prevention tools for Facebook posts will now be integrated into Facebook Live. People watching a live video have the option to reach out to the person directly and to report the video to us. We will also provide resources to the person reporting the live video to assist them in helping their friend. The person sharing a live video will see a set of resources on their screen. They can choose to reach out to a friend, contact a help line or see tips. If you or someone you know is in crisis, it is important to call local emergency services right away. You can also visit our Help Center for information about how to support yourself or a friend. Empowering Crisis Support Partners Partners are key to our work in suicide prevention and mental health support. We recently added the ability for people to connect with our crisis support partners over Messenger. Now people will see the option to message with someone in real time directly from the organization’s Page or through our suicide prevention tools. Participating organizations include Crisis Text Line, the National Eating Disorder Association and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. This test will expand over the next several months, ensuring the organizations can support any new volume of communication. Zendesk donated some of the company’s backend tools to make this integration possible. Today, we are also launching a video campaign with partner organizations across the globe to raise awareness about ways to help a friend in need. Making Reporting Easier We work to address posts expressing thoughts of suicide as quickly and accurately as possible. Based on feedback from experts, we are testing a streamlined reporting process using pattern recognition in posts previously reported for suicide. This artificial intelligence approach will make the option to report a post about “suicide or self injury” more prominent for potentially concerning posts like these. We’re also testing pattern recognition to identify posts as very likely to include thoughts of suicide. Our Community Operations team will review these posts and, if appropriate, provide resources to the person who posted the content, even if someone on Facebook has not reported it yet. We are starting this limited test in the US and will continue working closely with suicide prevention experts to understand other ways we can use technology to help provide support. Suicide prevention is one way we’re working to build a safer community on Facebook. With the help of our partners and people’s friends and family members on Facebook, we’re hopeful we can support more people over time."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/02/new-ways-to-watch-facebook-video/","date":"2017-02-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"New Ways to Watch Facebook Video","text":"By Dana Sittler, Product Manager, and Alex Li, Engineering Manager People are watching and sharing more video on Facebook than ever, and we’re focused on continuously improving the video experience. Today, we’re excited to share several updates that make watching video on Facebook richer, more engaging and more flexible. Bringing Sound to Videos in News Feed Videos in News Feed have previously played silently — you tap on a video to hear sound. As people watch more video on phones, they’ve come to expect sound when the volume on their device is turned on. After testing sound on in News Feed and hearing positive feedback, we’re slowly bringing it to more people. With this update, sound fades in and out as you scroll through videos in News Feed, bringing those videos to life. If your phone is set to silent, videos will not play with sound. If you never want videos to play with sound, you can disable this feature by switching off “Videos in News Feed Start With Sound” in Settings. We’ll also be showing in-product messages to tell people about the new sound on experience and controls. Vertical Video We’ve also made changes to make vertical videos look better on mobile devices. Last year we began testing a larger preview of vertical videos in News Feed on mobile. People responded positively, so that larger format is now available to everyone watching videos on iOS and Android. Watch and Scroll We know that sometimes you want to watch a video and also want to keep scrolling through your News Feed. It’s now possible to minimize the video you’re watching to a picture-in-picture view that keeps playing in the corner of your screen while you browse other stories in News Feed. You can drag the video to any corner of the screen, and if you’re using an Android device, you can keep the video playing even when you exit the Facebook app to do something else on your phone. Facebook Video App for TV Finally, we’ve heard that people want more options for how and where they watch Facebook videos. Today we’re announcing a new Facebook video app for TV, which will roll out soon to app stores for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV, with more platforms to come. Our video app for TV is a new way to enjoy Facebook videos on a bigger screen. Last year we rolled out the ability for you to stream videos from Facebook to your TV, and today’s announcement expands this capability. With the app, you can watch videos shared by friends or Pages you follow, top live videos from around the world, and recommended videos based on your interests. You can also catch up on videos you’ve saved to watch later, as well as revisit videos you’ve watched, shared or uploaded. We look forward to seeing how people use the app to enjoy Facebook videos in a new way."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/02/empowering-people-to-help-one-another-within-safety-check/","date":"2017-02-07T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Empowering People to Help One Another Within Safety Check","text":"By Naomi Gleit, VP Social Good In times of crisis, connecting is more important than ever. Today we’re announcing an update to Safety Check, called Community Help, that lets people find and give help such as food, shelter and transportation after a crisis. Our belief is that the community can teach us new ways to use the platform. We saw people using Facebook to tell friends and family they were OK after crises, so in 2014 we launched Safety Check to make that behavior even easier. Since then, Safety Check has been activated hundreds of times, but we know we can do more to empower the community to help one another. With Community Help people can find and give help, and message others directly to connect after a crisis. Posts can be viewed by category and location, making it easier for people to find the help they need. Again, we saw the community do this on their own through Groups and posts, like in the aftermath of the flooding in Chennai, India, in December 2015, but we knew we could do more. We also talked with experts, humanitarian relief organizations and our own in-the-field researchers to learn how to make it easier for people to find and give help. To start, we will make Community Help available for natural and accidental incidents, such as an earthquake or building fire. We’re also starting in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and Saudi Arabia for the first couple of weeks, and as we learn more about how people use the product, we will look to improve it and make it available for all countries and additional types of incidents. For the community to use Community Help after an incident, Safety Check must first be activated. For Safety Check to activate, two things need to happen: First, global crisis reporting agencies NC4 and iJET International alert Facebook that an incident has occurred and give it a title, and we begin monitoring for posts about the incident in the area. Second, if a lot of people are talking about the incident, they may be prompted to mark themselves safe, and invite others to do the same. And starting today, if an incident is a natural or accidental disaster, people will see Community Help. They can find or give help, and message others directly to connect from within Safety Check. With every activation, we are continuing to learn how to make Safety Check and features like Community Help better for people in need. We will continue listening to feedback to make the tool more useful and relevant in the future."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/01/news-feed-fyi-new-signals-to-show-you-more-authentic-and-timely-stories/","date":"2017-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI"],"title":"New Signals to Show You More Authentic and Timely Stories","text":"By Akos Lada, Research Scientist, James Li, Research Scientist, and Shilin Ding, Engineering Manager Our goal with News Feed is to show people the stories that are most relevant to them. Today we’re announcing two updates to better rank posts in your feed: Incorporating new signals to better identify and rank authentic content A new way to predict and rank in real-time when posts might be more relevant to you New Signals to Identify Authentic Content One of our News Feed values is authentic communication. We’ve heard from our community that authentic stories are the ones that resonate most — those that people consider genuine and not misleading, sensational or spammy. When ranking News Feed we look at many signals personal to you, such as how close you are to the person or Page posting, as well as more universal signals like the overall engagement (likes, comments, shares) that a post has. With this update, we’re adding new universal signals to determine whether a post might be authentic. To do this, we categorized Pages to identify whether or not they were posting spam or trying to game feed by doing things like asking for likes, comments or shares. We then used posts from these Pages to train a model that continuously identifies whether posts from other Pages are likely to be authentic. For example, if Page posts are often being hidden by people reading them, that’s a signal that it might not be authentic. If a post is likely to be authentic based on the new signals we look at, it might show up higher in your feed. Updates to Real-Time Signals When ranking feed to determine the relevance of a post, we always look at real-time signals, such as whether a friend has just commented on it. We continue to improve News Feed to evaluate the importance of different signals at different times. With today’s update, we will now take into account how signals change in real time. So now if there is a lot of engagement from many people on Facebook about a topic, or if a post from a Page is getting a lot of engagement, we can understand in real-time that the topic or Page post might be temporarily more important to you, so we should show that content higher in your feed. For example, if your favorite soccer team just won a game, we might show you posts about the game higher up in News Feed because people are talking about it more broadly on Facebook. Will This Impact My Page? We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed. Some Pages might see a small increase in referral traffic or outbound clicks, and some Pages might see minor decreases. Pages should continue to post stories that are relevant to their audiences."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2017/01/introducing-the-new-privacy-basics/","date":"2017-01-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Introducing the New Privacy Basics","text":"Today we’re introducing a new Privacy Basics to make it easier for people to find tools for controlling their information on Facebook.

We’re listening to people’s feedback and will continue to make improvements in order to provide a valuable Trending experience. Publisher Headlines In order to provide people with more context on what is trending on Facebook, we will now display a headline from a publisher’s article about that topic. This was the most requested feature addition since the last update we made to Trending in August. These are the same headlines that appear when you hover over or click on a Trending topic, but people told us they wanted these headlines directly within Trending, too. The headline that appears is automatically selected based on a combination of factors including the engagement around the article on Facebook, the engagement around the publisher overall, and whether other articles are linking to it. Just as before, after clicking on a topic, people are taken to a personalized results page that includes additional sources and posts about the topic. Identifying Topics We’re also updating how topics are identified as trending on Facebook. Previously, topics may have trended due to high engagement on Facebook around a single post or article. With today’s update, we will now look at the number of publishers that are posting articles on Facebook about the same topic, and the engagement around that group of articles. This should surface trending topics quicker, be more effective at capturing a broader range of news and events from around the world and also help ensure that trending topics reflect real world events being covered by multiple news outlets. Everyone in the same region sees the same topics Lastly, the list of which topics are trending on Facebook will no longer be personalized based on someone’s interests. Everyone in the same region will see the same topics. This is designed to help make sure people don’t miss important topics being discussed on Facebook that might not show up in their News Feed. Update on April 21, 2017: These updates have now rolled out to all countries where Trending is currently available, including Australia, Canada, India and UK. Some commonly asked questions about Trending: When did you first create Trending? We added Trending in 2014. It was designed to help people discover interesting and relevant topics being discussed on Facebook that they might not otherwise see in their News Feed. Where is Trending available? Is it available on mobile devices? Trending is available in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India. Currently, it is available for Facebook on the web, and can be seen on mobile by clicking on the Search bar. Today’s updates will be rolled out in the US beginning today. We hope to make them available to more countries in the future. Do people select topics? No. Topics are selected by an algorithm and are reviewed by a team to ensure they represent real-world events. The Quality Review guidelines can be found here. What steps have you taken to prevent fake news from appearing in Trending? Trending uses a variety of signals from News Feed, including when people report news as fake or spam, to help prevent fake news, hoaxes or spam from appearing in Trending. Today’s update may also help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing in Trending because the updated system identifies groups of articles shared on Facebook instead of relying solely on mentions of a topic."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/12/introducing-more-ways-to-connect-and-share-moments/","date":"2016-12-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing More Ways to Connect and Share Moments","text":"By Gary Briggs, Chief Marketing Officer Every day people use Facebook to share moments with their friends.

We’re committed to doing our part and today we’d like to share some updates we’re testing and starting to roll out. We believe in giving people a voice and that we cannot become arbiters of truth ourselves, so we’re approaching this problem carefully. We’ve focused our efforts on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third party organizations. The work falls into the following four areas. These are just some of the first steps we’re taking to improve the experience for people on Facebook. We’ll learn from these tests, and iterate and extend them over time. Easier Reporting We’re testing several ways to make it easier to report a hoax if you see one on Facebook, which you can do by clicking the upper right hand corner of a post. We’ve relied heavily on our community for help on this issue, and this can help us detect more fake news. Flagging Stories as Disputed We believe providing more context can help people decide for themselves what to trust and what to share. We’ve started a program to work with third-party fact checking organizations that are signatories of Poynter’s International Fact Checking Code of Principles. We’ll use the reports from our community, along with other signals, to send stories to these organizations. If the fact checking organizations identify a story as fake, it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed. It will still be possible to share these stories, but you will see a warning that the story has been disputed as you share. Once a story is flagged, it can’t be made into an ad and promoted, either. Informed Sharing We’re always looking to improve News Feed by listening to what the community is telling us. We’ve found that if reading an article makes people significantly less likely to share it, that may be a sign that a story has misled people in some way. We’re going to test incorporating this signal into ranking, specifically for articles that are outliers, where people who read the article are significantly less likely to share it. Disrupting Financial Incentives for Spammers We’ve found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated. Spammers make money by masquerading as well-known news organizations, and posting hoaxes that get people to visit to their sites, which are often mostly ads. So we’re doing several things to reduce the financial incentives. On the buying side we’ve eliminated the ability to spoof domains, which will reduce the prevalence of sites that pretend to be real publications. On the publisher side, we are analyzing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary. It’s important to us that the stories you see on Facebook are authentic and meaningful. We’re excited about this progress, but we know there’s more to be done. We’re going to keep working on this problem for as long as it takes to get it right."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/12/facebook-2016-year-in-review/","date":"2016-12-07T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Trends"],"title":"Facebook’s 2016 Year In Review","text":"By Sheida Neman, Data Analyst Every day people turn to Facebook to share the moments that matter most to them.

Mark Zuckerberg opened today’s Social Good Forum with a video on our work to help keep people safe. Crisis Response: Safety Check and Community Help People use Facebook to let friends and family know they’re okay during a crisis. We launched Safety Check in 2014 to make this easier. Initially, Facebook decided when Safety Check was activated, but our goal has always been to make it more useful for people for more types of incidents. We believe people closest to a disaster should play a bigger role in deciding when Safety Check is most helpful. So today, Safety Check will be turned on by our community instead of Facebook. How this works is that once an incident occurs, a third party source alerts Facebook. As part of that process the incident is automatically titled in line with the third party alert. If a lot of people in the area are talking about the incident, they may be invited to mark themselves safe, and invite others to do the same, through Safety Check. In addition to using Facebook to let people know they’re safe after a disaster event, people also use Facebook to get the information and help they need to stay safe and rebuild. This spring we saw this in the aftermath of the fires in Fort McMurray, Canada, when people took to Facebook to help one another find a place to stay. Next year, we’re making these connections even easier with Community Help, a place where people can give and get help for things like shelter, food and supplies. After a natural disaster, someone can check in as safe and also ask for and offer help to those around them. Charitable giving: More nonprofits, ways to donate, partnerships In June, we started helping people raise money through Fundraisers for an initial group of nonprofits directly on Facebook. Today we’re expanding these tools so people can fundraise for more than 750,000 nonprofits and add a donate button to Live videos and posts. For the month of November, people in the U.S. can use Facebook to collect donations and increase awareness for their Movember Foundation campaign in support of men’s health. They’ll be able to sync their fundraisers then raise money through both Movember.com and Facebook. In honor of #GivingTuesday, Facebook and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will contribute up to $1 million to Facebook fundraisers. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will provide $500,000 in matching funds, up to $1,000 per Facebook fundraiser, and Facebook will waive up to $500,000 of fees on all donations. We are thankful for all the people and nonprofits who shared their stories with us at today’s Social Good Forum. While it’s still very early in this journey, we’re inspired by the good our community already does and we are committed to doing more to help people in times of need and beyond."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/10/no-tricks-just-treats-from-facebook-this-halloween/","date":"2016-10-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"No Tricks, Just Treats From Facebook This Halloween","text":"Over the years, we’ve seen that people come to Facebook to share fun moments, show off costumes, and connect with friends and family on Halloween. This year, we’re introducing some fun new ways to help you get into the Halloween spirit. Masks in Facebook Live: You’ll be able to try on a variety of different masks — including limited-edition Halloween-themed masks — when you’re sharing live video. Halloween Reactions: We’re launching a set of limited-edition Halloween reactions that turn the Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry reactions into Halloween-themed symbols that come to life when you tap on them. Introducing Masks in Facebook Live If you’re looking to share moments in real time with added flair, you will soon be able to go live on Facebook wearing a mask. We have a number of festive masks for Halloween, including a skull, an evil queen and two limited-edition masks: a pumpkin and a witch. A selection of masks will continue to be available after Halloween, so you can be creative in your Live videos any time! Masks will be rolling out over the next few days for people using Facebook Live on iOS in the US, UK and New Zealand. In the coming months, we will make masks available to people sharing live video via Android devices and in more countries. Masks will also be available to public figures using Facebook Mentions on iOS, meaning people may see their favorite celebrities trying on masks in their live videos on Facebook. Here’s how to go live with a mask: Tap the Live Video icon at the top of your Timeline, News Feed or Page. Once you are live, tap the magic wand in the upper left corner of your screen. Select the masks icon in the creative tools tray at the bottom of your screen. Scroll through the options and tap on masks to have them automatically appear on your face when you are live. To remove the mask, simply scroll left in the mask trap and tap the no mask sign. Halloween Reactions We’re also launching a set of limited-edition reactions to people in a select set of countries in the days leading up to and through Halloween. From a cackling witch to express laughter, to a grimacing jack o’lantern to show anger, you’ll be sure to get into the holiday spirit with these fun and playful reactions. To use the Halloween reactions, hold down the Like button on mobile or hover over the Like button on desktop to see the reaction image options, then choose from the skeletal thumbs up (Like), the candy heart (Love), the laughing witch (Haha), the ghost (Wow), Frankenstein (Sad), or the scowling pumpkin (Angry).

Get Recommendations Whether traveling to a new place, looking for a hair salon, or searching for the perfect place to eat, people already turn to their friends, family, and local Groups on Facebook for advice. We’re rolling out a new tool that makes it easier to get and organize all those recommendations in one place. When you write a Facebook post looking for advice on local places or services, you’ll have the option to turn on Recommendations for that post. If you turn on the feature, your friends can comment on your post with suggestions, and you’ll see all of them mapped out and saved in one place. You can also go to your Recommendations bookmark on Facebook (desktop only) to ask a new question or help your friends. Discover Local Events Facebook is a great way to find events happening around you and now it’s even easier to discover new things to do with friends. To make exploring events even better, we’ve revamped the Events bookmark on Facebook. You can catch up on the latest events activity from friends and hosts and browse event recommendations based on what’s popular with friends or events you’ve connected with in the past. This new version of the events dashboard will start to roll out in the US in the coming weeks. Get More Out of Your Local Business Interactions on Facebook We’re introducing some new ways for people to take action faster once they’ve found something they want to do or a place they want to go. Order food: You can now order food from restaurants directly from their Facebook Pages. Simply click “Start Order” on any restaurant’s Facebook Page that uses Delivery.com or Slice. Request an appointment: For local businesses that require you to book an appointment, such as spas and salons, you can now request a time via the business’ Facebook Page and view their entire slate of services and offerings. They’ll then get back to you on Messenger to confirm your appointment. Get a quote: Some local business Pages will now have a “Get Quote” button at the top that lets you easily and quickly request a quote from the business. Get tickets to movies and events: For many new movies this fall, you can buy movie tickets straight from their Facebook Pages via Fandango. In partnership with Ticketmaster and Eventbrite, we’re also making it possible for people to get tickets to other events — free or paid — directly from the event page on Facebook. We’re starting to roll out these initial experiences in the US today. This is the first step, and over the coming months we’ll be launching even more new features that will make it easier to get things done, make confident decisions and communicate directly with businesses on your time and terms."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/10/a-new-way-to-watch-videos-from-facebook-on-your-tv/","date":"2016-10-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"A New Way to Watch Videos From Facebook on Your TV","text":"For the latest information on the Facebook Watch TV app, visit our Help Center.

Here’s how it works: When you open Events, you can quickly catch up on new events your friends are interested in, recently-announced events by the Pages you like, and updates from events you’re already connected to. If you’re looking for something to do this weekend or even right now, you can easily browse event recommendations based on time, location and your interests. Explore events happening where you are or in places you like to go using the interactive map. You can also search for events in any city if you’re planning ahead for a trip. Finally, you can keep track of all of your upcoming events in the calendar, which lets you see which days you’re already attending an event and when you’re free. You can even choose calendars you want to add from your phone and view them alongside your Facebook events, so it’s easier to make plans. The actions you take on events in the app will also be visible and available on Facebook. This way, your friends can see what you’re interested in and what events you’ve shared with them, even if they don’t have the app. Events is available in the App Store for iPhone users in the US today, and is coming soon to Android."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/10/introducing-marketplace-buy-and-sell-with-your-local-community/","date":"2016-10-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Marketplace: Buy and Sell With Your Local Community","text":"For the latest information on how to use Marketplace, visit our Help Center. Facebook is where people connect, and in recent years more people have been using Facebook to connect in another way: buying and selling with each other. This activity started in Facebook Groups and has grown substantially. More than 450 million people visit buy and sell groups each month — from families in a local neighborhood to collectors around the world. To help people make more of these connections, today we’re introducing Marketplace, a convenient destination to discover, buy and sell items with people in your community. Marketplace makes it easy to find new things you’ll love, and find a new home for the things you’re ready to part with. We’ll continue to build new options and features to make this the best experience for people. To visit Marketplace, just tap on the shop icon at the bottom of the Facebook app and start exploring. Discover Items for Sale Near You Marketplace opens with photos of items that people near you have listed for sale. To find something specific, search at the top and filter your results by location, category or price. You can also browse what’s available in a variety of categories such as Household, Electronics and Apparel. Use the built-in location tool to adjust the region you’re looking in, or switch to a different city altogether. When you find something interesting, tap on the image to see more details from the seller, including a product description, the name and profile photo of the seller, and their general location. You can also save the item to find it later. Decided that you want it? Send the seller a direct message from Marketplace to tell them you’re interested and make an offer. From that point on, you and the seller can work out the details in any way you choose. Facebook does not facilitate the payment or delivery of items in Marketplace. Post Items for Sale in Just a Few Steps Selling an item in Marketplace is just as easy as browsing for one. Simply: Take a photo of your item, or add it from your camera roll Enter a product name, description and price Confirm your location and select a category Post Now anyone looking in your area can find your item and message you if they want to buy it. You can also choose to post to Marketplace and a specific buy and sell group at the same time. To keep track of all of your current and past transactions in Marketplace, visit the Your Items section. There, you can view your saved items, products you’ve posted for sale, and all your messages with people. Now in Four Countries, With More to Come Over the next few days, Marketplace will be rolling out to everyone over 18 years old in the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand on the Facebook app for iPhone and Android. We will continue expanding to additional countries and make Marketplace available on the desktop version of Facebook in the coming months."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/08/an-update-to-trending/","date":"2016-08-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"An Update To Trending","text":"Today we announced some changes to Trending.

We added Trending to Facebook in 2014, and similar to Search, Trending was designed to help people discover interesting and relevant conversations happening on Facebook, about breaking news and events from around the world. Our goal is to enable Trending for as many people as possible, which would be hard to do if we relied solely on summarizing topics by hand. A more algorithmically driven process allows us to scale Trending to cover more topics and make it available to more people globally over time. This is something we always hoped to do but we are making these changes sooner given the feedback we got from the Facebook community earlier this year. Here’s how these changes will work: Instead of seeing a story description in Trending, you’ll now see a simplified topic — for example, #PhelpsFace or NASA — as well as the number of people talking about that particular topic on Facebook. This is based on the number of original posts that mention the topic and shares of posts about the topic. To see more about what people are saying about a topic, you can hover over it or click on it. A search results page will include the news sources that are covering it, posts discussing it and an automatically selected original news story with an excerpt pulled directly from the top article itself. As before, articles and posts that appear in search results are surfaced algorithmically, based on a high volume of mentions and a sharp increase in mentions over a short period of time. Like much of the content you see across Facebook, the list of topics you see is still personalized based on a number of factors, including Pages you’ve liked, your location (for example home state sports news), the previous trending topics with which you’ve interacted, and what is trending across Facebook overall. There are still people involved in this process to ensure that the topics that appear in Trending remain high-quality — for example, confirming that a topic is tied to a current news event in the real world. The topic #lunch is talked about during lunchtime every day around the world, but will not be a trending topic. These changes mean that we no longer need to do things like write topic descriptions and short story summaries since we’re relying on an algorithm to pull excerpts directly from news stories. Our team will still strictly follow our guidelines, which have been updated to reflect these changes. Earlier this year, we shared more information about Trending in response to questions about alleged political bias in the product. We looked into these claims and found no evidence of systematic bias. Still, making these changes to the product allows our team to make fewer individual decisions about topics. Facebook is a platform for all ideas, and we’re committed to maintaining Trending as a way for people to access a breadth of ideas and commentary about a variety of topics. We’ll continue to listen to feedback from our community and make additional changes needed to provide a valuable Trending experience for the people who use Facebook every day."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/08/news-feed-fyi-showing-you-more-personally-informative-stories/","date":"2016-08-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Showing You More Personally Informative Stories","text":"By Jie Xu, Research Scientist, Akos Lada, Data Scientist, and Vibhi Kant, Product Manager, News Feed People turn to Facebook to learn what’s going on with their friends and family and in the world around them — from learning more about a new hobby or recipe to reading about a current event. Our goal with News Feed is to show people the stories most relevant to them, so we rank stories so what’s most important to each person shows up highest in their News Feeds. When we rank and make improvements to News Feed, we rely on a set of core values. These values — which we’ve been using for years — guide our thinking and help us keep the central experience of News Feed intact as it evolves. One of our News Feed values is that the stories in your feed should be informative. What makes someone feel informed about the world is personal. Something that one person finds informative may be different from what another person finds informative. This could be a news article on a current event, a story about your favorite celebrity, a piece of local news, a review of an upcoming movie, a recipe or anything that informs you. To better understand how we can show people the most informative stories to them, we talk to people and ask them how we can improve what they see when they check Facebook. This is our Feed Quality Program, which includes global crowd-sourced surveys of tens of thousands of people per day, as well as people who answer more detailed questions about what they like seeing in their feeds. We ask people through this Feed Quality Program to rate their experience. For stories that people rate highly, we then ask them why they enjoyed seeing those particular stories. One of the most common reasons people give us is that the story made them feel informed about the world around them. Today, we’re making an update — adding another of many signals we take into account when ranking feed — to do a better job of showing people stories that they find informative. More Stories That Inform You With this update, we are creating a new ranking signal to predict what is most informative to you, so those stories appear higher in your feed. First, we look at the stories that people tell us they find informative. People from our Feed Quality Program look at each story in their feed and rank it on a scale of one to five — one being “really not informative” and five being “really informative.” Generally, we’ve found people find stories informative if they are related to their interests, if they engage people in broader discussions and if they contain news about the world around them. That could be anything from recipes, to local issues, to global current events. The stories people rate as informative and really informative help create a new prediction about how informative we think you’ll find each story. We then combine this signal with how relevant the story might be to you personally — taking into account things like your relationship with the person or publisher that posted, or what you choose to click on, comment on or share — to best predict stories that you might personally find informative. Informative stories are therefore different for each person and will likely change over time. Will This Impact My Pages? We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed. Some Pages might see a small increase in referral traffic, and some Pages might see minor decreases. Pages should continue to post stories that are relevant to their audiences and that their audiences might find informative."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/08/a-new-way-to-control-the-ads-you-see-on-facebook-and-an-update-on-ad-blocking/","date":"2016-08-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"A New Way to Control the Ads You See on Facebook, and an Update on Ad Blocking","text":"By Andrew Bosworth, VP, Ads & Business Platform As more and more content has shifted to the internet, online experiences have improved dramatically, becoming more immersive and intuitive. But many digital ads haven’t kept up. We’ve all experienced a lot of bad ads: ads that obscure the content we’re trying to read, ads that slow down load times or ads that try to sell us things we have no interest in buying. Bad ads are disruptive and a waste of our time. Today, we’re announcing some changes to help with this problem. First, we’re expanding the tools we give people to control their advertising experience. Second, we’re providing an update on our approach to ad blocking on Facebook. What We’ve Done So Far For the past few years at Facebook we’ve worked to better understand people’s concerns with online ads. What we’ve heard is that people don’t like to see ads that are irrelevant to them or that disrupt or break their experience. People also want to have control over the kinds of ads they see. As a result of what we’ve learned, we’ve introduced tools to help people control their experience, improved how we decide which ads to show and created new ad formats that complement, rather than detract from, people’s experience online. Improving Ad Controls With today’s announcement, we’re building on these efforts by making ad preferences easier to use, so you can stop seeing certain types of ads. If you don’t want to see ads about a certain interest like travel or cats, you can remove the interest from your ad preferences. We also heard that people want to be able to stop seeing ads from businesses or organizations who have added them to their customer lists, and so we are adding tools that allow people to do this. These improvements are designed to give people even more control over how their data informs the ads they see. Addressing Ad Blocking When they’re relevant and well-made, ads can be useful, helping us find new products and services and introducing us to new experiences — like an ad that shows you your favorite band is coming to town or an amazing airline deal to a tropical vacation. But because ads don’t always work this way, many people have started avoiding certain websites or apps, or using ad blocking software, to stop seeing bad ads. These have been the best options to date. We’ve designed our ad formats, ad performance and controls to address the underlying reasons people have turned to ad blocking software. When we asked people about why they used ad blocking software, the primary reason we heard was to stop annoying, disruptive ads. As we offer people more powerful controls, we’ll also begin showing ads on Facebook desktop for people who currently use ad blocking software. Some ad blocking companies accept money in exchange for showing ads that they previously blocked — a practice that is at best confusing to people and that reduces the funding needed to support the journalism and other free services that we enjoy on the web. Facebook is one of those free services, and ads support our mission of giving people the power to share and making the world more open and connected. Rather than paying ad blocking companies to unblock the ads we show — as some of these companies have invited us to do in the past — we’re putting control in people’s hands with our updated ad preferences and our other advertising controls. We believe that these expanded controls give people a better experience with advertising on and off Facebook. We also know there’s more work to do, and we’re continually listening to your feedback to make advertising better for everyone."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/08/news-feed-fyi-further-reducing-clickbait-in-feed/","date":"2016-08-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","Integrity & Security","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Further Reducing Clickbait in Feed","text":"By Alex Peysakhovich, Research Scientist and Kristin Hendrix, User Experience Researcher Our goal with News Feed is to show people the stories most relevant to them — ranking stories so that what’s most important to each person shows up highest in their News Feeds. When we rank and make improvements to News Feed, we rely on a set of core values. These values — which we’ve been using for years — guide our thinking, and help us keep the central experience of News Feed intact as it evolves. One of our News Feed values is to have authentic communication on our platform. People have told us they like seeing authentic stories the most. That’s why we work hard to understand what type of stories and posts people consider genuine, so we can show more of them in News Feed. We also work to understand what kinds of stories people find misleading and spammy to help make sure people see those less. We’ve heard from people that they specifically want to see fewer stories with clickbait headlines or link titles. These are headlines that intentionally leave out crucial information, or mislead people, forcing people to click to find out the answer. For example: “When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw THIS… I Was SHOCKED!”; “He Put Garlic In His Shoes Before Going To Bed And What Happens Next Is Hard To Believe”; or “The Dog Barked At The Deliveryman And His Reaction Was Priceless.” To address this feedback from our community, we’re making an update to News Feed ranking to further reduce clickbait headlines in the coming weeks. With this update, people will see fewer clickbait stories and more of the stories they want to see higher up in their feeds. How we reduce clickbait headlines To address clickbait headlines, we previously made an update to News Feed that reduces the distribution of posts that lead people to click and then quickly come back to News Feed. While this update helped, we’re still seeing Pages rely on clickbait headlines, and people are still telling us they would prefer to see clearly written headlines that help them decide how they want to spend their time and not waste time on what they click. We are focusing more effort on this, and are updating News Feed by using a system that identifies phrases that are commonly used in clickbait headlines. First, we categorized tens of thousands of headlines as clickbait by considering two key points: (1) if the headline withholds information required to understand what the content of the article is; and (2) if the headline exaggerates the article to create misleading expectations for the reader. For example, the headline “You’ll Never Believe Who Tripped and Fell on the Red Carpet…” withholds information required to understand the article (What happened? Who Tripped?) The headline “Apples Are Actually Bad For You?!” misleads the reader (apples are only bad for you if you eat too many every day). A team at Facebook reviewed thousands of headlines using these criteria, validating each other’s work to identify a large set of clickbait headlines. From there, we built a system that looks at the set of clickbait headlines to determine what phrases are commonly used in clickbait headlines that are not used in other headlines. This is similar to how many email spam filters work. Our system identifies posts that are clickbait and which web domains and Pages these posts come from. Links posted from or shared from Pages or domains that consistently post clickbait headlines will appear lower in News Feed. News Feed will continue to learn over time — if a Page stops posting clickbait headlines, their posts will stop being impacted by this change. We’ll continue to update how we identify clickbait as we improve our systems and hear more from people using News Feed. Will this impact my Page? We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to their distribution in News Feed as a result of this change. However, websites and Pages who rely on clickbait-style headlines should expect their distribution to decrease. Pages should avoid headlines that withhold information required to understand what the content of the article is and headlines that exaggerate the article to create misleading expectations. As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices. We will learn from these changes and will continue to work on reducing clickbait so News Feed is a place for authentic communication."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/06/building-a-better-news-feed-for-you/","date":"2016-06-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","News Feed FYI","Product News"],"title":"Building a Better News Feed for You","text":"By Adam Mosseri, VP, Product Management, News Feed The goal of News Feed is to show people the stories that are most relevant to them. Today, we’re announcing an update to News Feed that helps you see more posts from your friends and family. We explain this change in more detail here. When we launched News Feed in 2006, it was hard to imagine the challenge we now face: far too much information for any one person to consume. In the decade since, more than a billion people have joined Facebook, and today they share a flood of stories every day. That’s why stories in News Feed are ranked — so that people can see what they care about first, and don’t miss important stuff from their friends. If the ranking is off, people don’t engage, and leave dissatisfied. So one of our most important jobs is getting this ranking right. As part of that process, we often make improvements to News Feed, and when we do, we rely on a set of core values. These values — which we’ve been using for years — guide our thinking, and help us keep the central experience of News Feed intact as it evolves. In our continued efforts to be transparent about how we think about News Feed, we want to share those values with you. News Feed Values Our success is built on getting people the stories that matter to them most. If you could look through thousands of stories every day and choose the 10 that were most important to you, which would they be? The answer should be your News Feed. It is subjective, personal, and unique — and defines the spirit of what we hope to achieve. FRIENDS AND FAMILY COME FIRST Facebook was built on the idea of connecting people with their friends and family. That is still the driving principle of News Feed today. Our top priority is keeping you connected to the people, places and things you want to be connected to — starting with the people you are friends with on Facebook. That’s why if it’s from your friends, it’s in your feed, period — you just have to scroll down. To help make sure you don’t miss the friends and family posts you are likely to care about, we put those posts toward the top of your News Feed. We learn from you and adapt over time. For example, if you tend to like photos from your sister, we’ll start putting her posts closer to the top of your feed so you won’t miss what she posted while you were away. Our research has also shown us that, after friends and family, people have two other strong expectations when they come to News Feed: Your feed should inform. People expect the stories in their feed to be meaningful to them — and we have learned over time that people value stories that they consider informative. Something that one person finds informative or interesting may be different from what another person finds informative or interesting — this could be a post about a current event, a story about your favorite celebrity, a piece of local news, or a recipe. We’re always working to better understand what is interesting and informative to you personally, so those stories appear higher up in your feed. Your feed should entertain. We’ve also found that people enjoy their feeds as a source of entertainment. For some people, that’s following a celebrity or athlete; for others it’s watching Live videos and sharing funny photos with their friends. We work hard to try to understand and predict what posts on Facebook you find entertaining to make sure you don’t miss out on those. A PLATFORM FOR ALL IDEAS We are not in the business of picking which issues the world should read about. We are in the business of connecting people and ideas — and matching people with the stories they find most meaningful. Our integrity depends on being inclusive of all perspectives and view points, and using ranking to connect people with the stories and sources they find the most meaningful and engaging. We don’t favor specific kinds of sources — or ideas. Our aim is to deliver the types of stories we’ve gotten feedback that an individual person most wants to see. We do this not only because we believe it’s the right thing but also because it’s good for our business. When people see content they are interested in, they are more likely to spend time on News Feed and enjoy their experience. It’s important to note that while we welcome a multitude of viewpoints, we also believe strongly that people should feel — and be — safe when they use Facebook, and we therefore have Community Standards that define the behavior that we think is out-of-bounds on the platform. We think it’s possible to be inclusive without making Facebook a place where people are subjected to attacks, hate, or other harmful behavior. AUTHENTIC COMMUNICATION The strength of our community depends on authentic communication. The feedback we’ve gotten tells us that authentic stories are the ones that resonate most. That’s why we work hard to understand what type of stories and posts people consider genuine — so we can show more of them in News Feed. And we work to understand what kinds of stories people find misleading, sensational and spammy, to make sure people see those less. YOU CONTROL YOUR EXPERIENCE Ultimately, you know what’s most meaningful to you — and that’s why we’ve developed controls so you can customize what you see. Features such as “unfollow,” “hide” and “see first” help you design your own experience — and when you use them, we take your actions as feedback to help us better understand what content is most important to you. For example, if you hide a story from someone, that signals that you’re less interested in hearing from that person in the future. As News Feed evolves, we’ll continue building easy-to-use and powerful tools to give you the most personalized experience. CONSTANT ITERATION We view our work as only 1 percent finished — and are dedicated to improving along the way. As we look for ways to get better, we will continue soliciting feedback. We will be as open as we can — providing explanations in News Feed FYI wherever possible and looking for opportunities to share how we work."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/06/news-feed-fyi-helping-make-sure-you-dont-miss-stories-from-friends/","date":"2016-06-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Helping Make Sure You Don’t Miss Stories from Friends","text":"By Lars Backstrom, Engineering Director Facebook was built on the idea of connecting people with their friends and family. As we say in our News Feed values, that is still the driving principle of News Feed today. Our top priority is keeping you connected to the people, places and things you want to be connected to — starting with the people you are friends with on Facebook. That’s why today, we’re announcing an upcoming change to News Feed ranking to help make sure you don’t miss stories from your friends. We previously made an update that tries to ensure that stories posted directly by the friends you care about, such as photos, videos, status updates or links, will be higher up in News Feed so you are less likely to miss them. We’ve heard from our community that people are still worried about missing important updates from the friends they care about. For people with many connections this is particularly important, as there are a lot of stories for them to see each day. So we are updating News Feed over the coming weeks so that the things posted by the friends you care about are higher up in your News Feed. Will This Impact My Page? Overall, we anticipate that this update may cause reach and referral traffic to decline for some Pages. The specific impact on your Page’s distribution and other metrics may vary depending on the composition of your audience. For example, if a lot of your referral traffic is the result of people sharing your content and their friends liking and commenting on it, there will be less of an impact than if the majority of your traffic comes directly through Page posts. We encourage Pages to post things that their audience are likely to share with their friends. As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices. We are always working to improve News Feed so people see the most relevant stories to them, and will continue to make ranking updates and share them here on our News Feed FYI blog."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/06/introducing-360-photos-on-facebook/","date":"2016-06-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing 360 Photos on Facebook","text":"By Andy Huang, Product Manager We introduced photos on Facebook more than a decade ago, and they quickly became one of the main ways that people share their experiences with their friends and the world. Hundreds of millions of photos are shared on Facebook each day, from fun snapshots to photos of major life milestones, and everything in between. Today, we’re improving photos on Facebook so that people can share more immersive views of their world. For the first time, you can now easily share 360 photos on Facebook. Simply take a panorama with your phone or capture a 360-degree photo using a 360 photo app or 360 camera, and then post it on Facebook as you would a normal photo. From there, we’ll convert it to an immersive 360 photo that people can explore, similar to how people experience 360 videos on Facebook. 360 photos are easy to identify in News Feed: just look for the compass icon on the right-hand side of the photo. Explore a 360 photo on mobile by tapping and dragging the photo or by moving your phone, and on the web by clicking and dragging. Now your friends can experience the moments you share in 360 as if they were actually there with you, from hiking through a national park, to wandering through a museum, to celebrating a wedding. Along with 360 photos from your friends and family, you can discover stunning new 360 photos on Facebook from public figures, publishers, and other organizations. 360 photos give you the ability to take the stage in front of 100,000 fans with Paul McCartney, get behind-the-scenes access to the Supreme Court via The New York Times, visit the International Space Station with NASA, and more. This medium enables new opportunities for creativity, and we’re excited to see what kinds of 360 photos get shared on Facebook. Beyond News Feed, you’ll also be able to explore Facebook 360 photos in virtual reality with the Samsung Gear VR, powered by Oculus. While using a supported Samsung device, simply click View in VR in the top left corner of the video, place the phone in the Gear VR, and experience the photo in an immersive VR environment. 360 photos are available to view today on Facebook via the web and the latest version of the Facebook app on iOS and Android. Over the next few days we’ll be rolling out the ability to share your own 360 photos on Facebook. How Do I Take 360 Photos? Take a panorama on your iOS device or Samsung Galaxy phone or capture a 360-degree photo using a 360 photo app or 360 camera. Open the Facebook app and share the photo as you would any other photo: tap the status tool from the top of your Timeline or News Feed, select Photo/Video, choose the photo you want to share, and tap Post. Once your photo is posted, look around in your photo — or any other 360 photo in News Feed that’s marked with the compass icon — by moving your phone or dragging with your finger. Tap on the photo to view it in full screen. On Samsung Gear VR-compatible phones, you’ll see a button in the top left corner of your photo that says “View in VR.” If you tap on that button and insert your phone into your Gear VR headset, you can see your 360 photo in virtual reality. To learn more about 360 photos, visit our Facebook 360 site or join our Facebook 360 Community group to be a part of the daily 360 and VR conversation. You can also learn more in the Help Center."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/05/information-about-trending-topics/","date":"2016-05-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Information About Trending Topics","text":"By Justin Osofsky, VP Global Operations At Facebook, we stand for connecting every person — for a global community, for bringing people together, for giving all people a voice, for a free flow of ideas and culture across nations. One of the most powerful ways people connect is around major events — in their communities and in the larger world. People also connect through conversations on the topics they are most interested in. At its core, Trending Topics is designed to help people discover major events and meaningful conversations. Trending Topics is a feature we added in 2014 — separate from a person’s News Feed — to help people discover content that is both popular in the world and meaningful to them. Topics that are eligible to appear in the product are surfaced by our algorithms, not people. This product also has a team of people who play an important role in making sure that what appears in Trending Topics is high-quality and useful. The Trending Topics team is governed by a set of guidelines meant to ensure a high-quality product, consistent with Facebook’s deep commitment to being a platform for people of all viewpoints. Our goal has always been to deliver a valuable experience for the people who use our service. The guidelines demonstrate that we have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum. Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to discriminate against sources of any political origin, period. Here are the guidelines we use. Here is an overview of how Trending Topics works: Surfaced by algorithm Potential Trending Topics are first surfaced by an algorithm that identifies topics that have recently spiked in popularity on Facebook (in other words, ones that have a high volume of mentions and a sharp increase in mentions over a short period of time). The Trending Topics algorithm also uses an external RSS website crawler to identify breaking events so that we can connect people to conversations on Facebook about newsworthy events as quickly as possible. A list of included websites is available here. Reviewed by the Trending Topics team Members of the Trending team look at potential Trending Topics as they are surfaced by the algorithm and do the following: Confirm that the topic is tied to a current news event in the real world (for example, the topic “#lunch” is talked about during lunch every day around the world, but will not be a trending topic). Write a topic description with information that is corroborated by reporting from at least three of a list of more than a thousand media outlets. A list of these media outlets is available here. Apply a category label to the topic (ex. sports, science) to help with personalized ranking and to enable suggestions grouped by category for the various tabs on the desktop version. Check to see whether the topic is national or global breaking news that is being covered by most or all of ten major media outlets— and if it is, the topic is given an importance level that may make the topic more likely to be seen. A list of these outlets is available in the guidelines. Personalized The list of Trending Topics is then personalized for each user via an algorithm that relies on a number of factors, including the importance of the topic, Pages a person has liked, location (for example home state sports news), feedback provided by the user about previous Trending Topics and what’s trending across Facebook overall. Not everyone sees the same topics at the same time. The Trending search results page When you click on a Trending Topic, you are taken to a search results page that includes all the news sources and posts that are covering the topic. The articles and posts that appear here are also surfaced algorithmically. Trending is also integrated into Facebook Search so you can search for any Trending topic that may not show up in your Trending suggestions. FAQ Q. Why was Trending Topics created? Trending Topics was launched in 2014 to surface the major conversations happening on Facebook. It has evolved over time, and remains a work in progress. Trending Topics is a relatively limited part of the Facebook experience — appearing on the right hand side on desktop as well as when you tap on the Search box in the mobile app, and primarily for people using Facebook in English (there are limited tests being run in Spanish and Portuguese). Q: How do you protect against bias in the Trending Topics product? First and foremost, the algorithm that surfaces topics eligible for review optimizes for popularity and frequency on Facebook and whether it is a real world event — and does not consider perspective or politics. Second, we have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum, as well as to eliminate noise that does not relate to a current newsworthy event but might otherwise be surfaced through our algorithm. Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to discriminate against sources of any political origin, period. The guidelines that govern our review: do not permit the suppression of political perspectives do not permit the prioritization of one ideological viewpoint over another Lastly, we regularly audit the work of members of our review team to ensure that it complies with the guidelines. Violating the guidelines is a fireable offense. Q. Have reviewers been instructed by Facebook to inject specific stories into Trending Topics to suppress conservative news/sites? No — and the guidelines do not permit reviewers to add or suppress political perspectives. Q. What does ‘injecting’ mean? Could someone who is reviewing the Trending Topics artificially inject a topic into Trending Topics? Potential Trending Topics are first surfaced by an algorithm that identifies topics that have recently spiked in popularity on Facebook or are suggested by an external RSS website crawler to identify breaking news events. If, in this process, a topic is detected that should connect to a linguistically-similar but distinct topic (ex. the LEGO movie vs LEGO the toy), the reviewer may replace the topic ID by “injecting” a more accurate topic ID. Similarly, we might inject “#Odile” as a better way to represent a hurricane occurring in Cabo San Lucas than the topics “Baja” and “Cabo,” which might be surfaced by the algorithm. Injection helps improve Trending Topics over time by surfacing higher-quality topics. It is not used to promote articles or topics from a particular perspective. Q: Can reviewers remove or suppress political topics they don’t like by “blacklisting” them? The guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. About 40% of the topics in the queue get rejected by the reviewers because they reflect what is considered “noise” — a random word or name that lots of people are using in lots of different ways. For example, braised, DVD, #weekend and #sale are all topics that were not accepted as trends over the past week. This tool is not used to suppress or remove articles or topics from a particular perspective. Q. Is Facebook investigating whether employees did manipulate the Trending Topics list in ways alleged in the Gizmodo stories? Yes. We take these reports very seriously, and will continue to investigate the allegations. We have found no evidence to date that Trending Topics was successfully manipulated, but will continue the review of all our practices. *Update: Clearer language around Trending Topics After last week’s report, we’re continuing to look into Trending Topics and our guidelines. As part of that process, we have begun to test out some ways to make our terminology more clear: “Blacklist” => has been changed to “REVISIT”: This refers to the ability to remove junk hashtags from the trending topics list. About 40% of the topics in the queue get rejected by the reviewers because they reflect what is considered “noise” — a random word or name that lots of people are using in lots of different ways, or a word that is is duplicative of something that’s already trending. This tool may not be used to suppress or remove articles or topics from any particular perspective. These topics are removed from the list for a period of time (usually 24 hours, but can be less). If the topic is still surfaced by our algorithms after the time has elapsed it will reappear in the Trending Topics tool for a second review. “Injection” => has been changed to “TOPIC CORRECTION”: Topics that are eligible to appear in the product are surfaced by our algorithms, not people. If, in this process, a topic is detected that connects to another topic in the list, the reviewer may replace the topic ID by “injecting” a more accurate topic ID. For example, we might inject “#Odile” as a better way to represent a hurricane occurring in Cabo San Lucas than the topics “Baja” and “Cabo,” which might be surfaced by the algorithm. Injection helps improve Trending Topics over time by surfacing higher-quality topics. It may not be used to promote articles or topics from a particular perspective."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/04/news-feed-fyi-from-f8-how-news-feed-works/","date":"2016-04-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"From F8: How News Feed Works","text":"Adam Mosseri, VP of Product Management for News Feed, talking about what News Feed is, how it works and what this means for publishers."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/04/news-feed-fyi-more-articles-you-want-to-spend-time-viewing/","date":"2016-04-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"More Articles You Want to Spend Time Viewing","text":"By Moshe Blank, Software Engineer, and Jie Xu, Research Scientist As we work to improve News Feed, we make updates to help make sure you see the most relevant stories at the top. As part of this work, we ask thousands of people to rate their experience every day and tell us how we can improve what they see when they check Facebook — we call this our Feed Quality Program. From these conversations we have learned that the actions people take on Facebook—liking, clicking, commenting or sharing a post—don’t always tell us the whole story of what is most meaningful to them. For example, we’ve found that there are stories people don’t like or comment on that they still want to see, such as articles about a serious current event, or sad news from a friend. Based on this finding, we previously updated News Feed’s ranking to factor in how much time you spend reading a post within News Feed, regardless of whether you opened the article. We also previously updated News Feed’s ranking to take into account times when someone clicked on an article and came straight back to News Feed as we learned that this often happened when the article someone clicked on wasn’t what they had expected from the post or the headline. Time Spent Viewing Building on this work, we’re learning that the time people choose to spend reading or watching content they clicked on from News Feed is an important signal that the story was interesting to them. We are adding another factor to News Feed ranking so that we will now predict how long you spend looking at an article in the Facebook mobile browser or an Instant Article after you have clicked through from News Feed. This update to ranking will take into account how likely you are to click on an article and then spend time reading it. We will not be counting loading time towards this — we will be taking into account time spent reading and watching once the content has fully loaded. We will also be looking at the time spent within a threshold so as not to accidentally treat longer articles preferentially. With this change, we can better understand which articles might be interesting to you based on how long you and others read them, so you’ll be more likely to see stories you’re interested in reading. This change only factors in the time people spend reading an article regardless of whether that time is spent reading an Instant Article or an article in the mobile web browser. Diversity of Page Posts We’ve also heard from people that they enjoy reading articles from a wide range of publishers, and it can be repetitive if too many articles from the same source are back to back in their News Feed. We’ll also be making an update to reduce how often people see several posts in a row from the same source in their News Feed. Will This Impact My Page? We’ve started rolling this out and will continue over the coming weeks. We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes. Some Pages might see a small increase in referral traffic, and some Pages might see minor decreases. As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/04/search-fyi-more-ways-to-discover-live-video/","date":"2016-04-06T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Search FYI"],"title":"Search FYI: More Ways to Discover Live Video","text":"By Dirk Stoop and Eugene Min, Product Managers Yesterday, we announced new features for Facebook Live.

The Video tab is located on the bottom navigation bar on iOS and on the top navigation bar on Android, and is a new destination for people to discover all kinds of video content they may be interested in. As we roll out this tab, we will be listening to feedback from people on what they find most interesting, and we will continue to iterate on the tab and its sections in the future. We hope you enjoy exploring the Video tab! Originally published on April 6, 2016: With Facebook Live you can use your phone to share a moment instantly with the people you care about. This means your friends, family or fans can be there with you, and you can respond to their comments and see their reactions. Since launching Facebook Live last summer to public figures via our Mentions app and more recently to everyone in the US using our iOS and Android apps we’ve been surprised and delighted with how people are using live video to connect and interact with each other all over the world. People are letting their friends discover their hobbies. Parents are using it to share moments in their kids’ lives with their extended families. Athletes are giving people a window into their training. Chefs are bringing their fans into their kitchen. Journalists are hosting global conversations on topics they care about. Aspiring musicians can now put on a live concert for their friends. Many people all over the world are using Facebook Live in many different ways to talk to and interact with the people that matter most to them. That’s why today we’re excited to announce new features for Facebook Live to give you more ways to discover, share, and interact with live video, and more ways to personalize your live broadcasts. Live for Groups and Events “Going live” on Facebook feels special because you are going live with the people you care about. Today we’re rolling out the ability to go live in Facebook Groups and Facebook Events. Live in Groups allows you to broadcast to just the people in the Facebook Group – so you can go live in your family group, or share a workout plan in a fitness group. Live in Events means you can go live from a birthday party to allow those that can’t make it to join the fun, and a performer can go live backstage to the people who’ve RSVP-ed to the event to give them a sneak peak. You can even use Events to schedule a live Q&A session. We hope this new ability to both broadcast and watch live video within Groups and Events enables people to connect more deeply with their closest friends, family and the communities of people who share their interests. Interactive Features: Live Reactions, Replay Comments, Live Filters Facebook Live is interactive and fun: Live reactions, replaying comments made while live and Live filters will make it even more so. Live Reactions makes it easy for your viewers to express their feelings in real time during a live broadcast. Using the same reactions we launched in News Feed, viewers can select Love, Haha, Wow, Sad or Angry, and the reactions animate right on top of the video. Live Reactions appear in real time and disappear quickly so broadcasters and other viewers can get a sense of how people are feeling at different points during the live video – it’s like hearing the crowd applaud and cheer. When your friend reacts to your video or to a video you are both watching together you’ll see their profile pic and a little starburst before their reaction appears. Live video on Facebook is truly interactive as broadcasters engage with their commenters and respond to their suggestions and questions. In fact, from initial data, we’ve seen that people comment more than 10 times more on Facebook Live videos than on regular videos. We want people watching the broadcast after the fact to feel “in” on the action. To achieve this, we will replay comments as they happened during the live broadcast when people watch it later. We’ve also heard that people want more creative ways to personalize their live broadcasts. Today we’re starting with a set of five Live Filters, and coming soon we’ll add the ability to draw or doodle on your video while live. Discover more live videos: Invite Friends, Live Video Destination and Live Map We’ve heard that people are having a lot of fun watching live with friends. That’s why today we’re also adding the option to send an invitation to a friend to watch with you right from the live video. Simply tap on the invite icon and select the friend you want to invite and they will receive a push notification with your invitation. People don’t want to miss out on great broadcasts that are live right now. So today, we’re starting to roll out a dedicated place on Facebook’s mobile app where you can discover live video that the world is talking about, live video from the friends and creators that matter most to you, and live video on topics you’re interested in. From that place, you can also search live and non-live videos, and choose to go live yourself. Simply tap on the new video icon in the app to navigate to this new space. Finally, if you want a visual way to explore public live broadcasts that are currently happening around the world, today we’re releasing a Facebook Live Map on desktop. People in more than 60 countries can now share live video, and we’ve been inspired by all the different global broadcasts. The Facebook Live Map gives you a window into what’s happening in the world right now. We’re also introducing new metrics for Pages sharing live video; read more on our Media blog. We’ve been humbled by all the amazing and creative ways that people have used Facebook Live so far, and we’re committed to creating the best experience for everyone who wants to create, watch and interact with live videos on Facebook. These features will be rolling out on iOS and Android over the coming weeks. We’ll keep working to bring you the best ways to broadcast, interact with, and discover live video. Stay tuned.

With more than 39 million people who are blind, and over 246 million who have a severe visual impairment, many people may feel excluded from the conversation around photos on Facebook. We want to build technology that helps the blind community experience Facebook the same way others enjoy it. That’s why today we’re introducing automatic alternative text. Automatic alternative text, or automatic alt text, is a new development that generates a description of a photo using advancements in object recognition technology. People using screen readers on iOS devices will hear a list of items a photo may contain as they swipe past photos on Facebook. Before today, people using screen readers would only hear the name of the person who shared the photo, followed by the term “photo” when they came upon an image in News Feed. Now we can offer a richer description of what’s in a photo thanks to automatic alt text. For instance, someone could now hear, “Image may contain three people, smiling, outdoors.” This is possible because of Facebook’s object recognition technology, which is based on a neural network that has billions of parameters and is trained with millions of examples. Each advancement in object recognition technology means that the Facebook Accessibility team will be able to make technology even more accessible for more people. When people are connected, they can achieve extraordinary things as individuals and as a community — and when everyone is connected, we all benefit. We are launching automatic alt text first on iOS screen readers set to English, but we plan to add this functionality for other languages and platforms soon. While this technology is still nascent, tapping its current capabilities to describe photos is an important step toward providing our visually impaired community the same benefits and enjoyment that everyone else gets from photos.

Given this feedback we’re now taking steps to reduce the visibility of Live streams that consist entirely of graphics with voting. If you post a Live video with graphics-only polls, it may not show up as high in people’s News Feeds. Originally published on March 1, 2016: News Feed is made up of posts from the friends and Pages you’ve connected to. These posts can be status updates, photos, videos, links and now, Facebook Live videos. We rolled out Facebook Live on iOS in December and last week we began rolling it out on Android in the US. Over the last three months Facebook Live video has become more and more popular and more and more people and Pages are creating and watching live videos. As with any new type of content in News Feed, we are learning what signals help us show you the most relevant Facebook Live videos for you personally. For example, a few years ago when more people began sharing and watching video on Facebook we listened to feedback to learn what signals helped us show people more of the videos they want to see and fewer of the videos they don’t. At first we updated News Feed ranking to take into account how many people watched a video and how long people watched for to help us personalize News Feed based on people’s preference for watching video. Over time we also learned that certain actions people take on a video, such as choosing to turn on sound or making the video full screen, are good signs they wanted to see that video, even if they didn’t choose to like it. Now that more and more people are watching Live videos, we are considering Live Videos as a new content type – different from normal videos – and learning how to rank them for people in News Feed. As a first step, we are making a small update to News Feed so that Facebook Live videos are more likely to appear higher in News Feed when those videos are actually live, compared to after they are no longer live. People spend more than 3x more time watching a Facebook Live video on average compared to a video that’s no longer live. This is because Facebook Live videos are more interesting in the moment than after the fact. What does this mean for my Page? Facebook Live is currently available for verified Pages and public figures using Mentions. We do not expect Pages to see significant changes as a result of this update. We will continue to learn how people are watching this new content type, and as we improve ranking for Facebook Live videos we’ll continue to post to our News Feed FYI blog."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/02/bringing-facebook-live-to-android-and-more-countries/","date":"2016-02-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Bringing Facebook Live to Android and More Countries","text":"By: Vadim Lavrusik, Product Manager and Dave Capra, Engineering Manager Facebook Live enables you to share your experiences and perspectives in real time, with the people who matter to you – whether you’re someone who wants to broadcast to friends and family, or a public figure who wants to connect with fans around the world. Live videos on Facebook are authentic and exciting, and we’re seeing people tuning in and engaging directly with broadcasters in the moment. In fact, we’ve seen that on average people watch a live video more than three times longer when it is live compared to when it is not live. We know that people on Android love interacting with live videos —more than 50% of people watching live videos are using Android devices. We’re excited to announce that in the next week we are going to start rolling out the ability for people on Android to share live video. We’re starting our Android rollout in the U.S., with more countries coming soon. Last month, we announced that we planned to start bringing the ability to broadcast live to countries around the world, and now people in more than 30 countries can share live video via iOS. We’ll continue to roll this out to more people as well as Pages in countries around the world in the coming weeks. To share live video, simply tap “What’s on your mind?” at the top of News Feed and select the Live Video icon. You can write a quick description and select the audience before going live. During your broadcast, you’ll see the number of live viewers, the names of friends who are tuning in, and respond to a real-time stream of comments. When you end your broadcast, it will be saved on your Timeline like any other video, which you can then delete or keep for your friends to watch later. You can discover live videos from your friends and public figures you follow right in News Feed.

That’s why today we are launching Reactions, an extension of the Like button, to give you more ways to share your reaction to a Facebook post in a quick and easy way. Our goal with News Feed is to show you the stories that matter most to you. Initially, just as we do when someone likes a post, if someone uses a Reaction, we will infer they want to see more of that type of post. In the beginning, it won’t matter if someone likes, “wows” or “sads” a post — we will initially use any Reaction similar to a Like to infer that you want to see more of that type of content. Over time we hope to learn how the different Reactions should be weighted differently by News Feed to do a better job of showing everyone the stories they most want to see. Will this impact my Page? We see this as an opportunity for businesses and publishers to better understand how people are responding to their content on Facebook. Page owners will be able to see Reactions to all of their posts on Page insights. Reactions will have the same impact on ad delivery as likes. We will spend time learning from this rollout and use feedback to improve.

We have been testing Reactions in a few markets since last year, and have received positive feedback so far.

The actions people take on Facebook—liking, clicking, commenting or sharing a post—are historically some of the main factors considered to determine what to show at the top of your News Feed. But these factors don’t always tell us the whole story of what is most meaningful to you. As part of our ongoing effort to improve News Feed, we ask over a thousand people to rate their experience every day and tell us how we can improve the content they see when they check Facebook — we call this our Feed Quality Panel. We also survey tens of thousands of people around the world each day to learn more about how well we’re ranking each person’s feed. We ask people to rate each story from one to five stars in response to the question “how much did you want to see this story in your News Feed?” From this research using a representative sample of people, we are able to better understand which stories people would be interested in seeing near the top of their News Feed even if they choose not to click, like or comment on them — and use this information to make ranking changes. We saw through our research that people reported having a better News Feed experience when the stories they see at the top are stories they are both likely to rate highly if asked and likely to engage with. We are making an update to News Feed that combines these two signals. News Feed will begin to look at both the probability that you would want to see the story at the top of your feed and the probability that you will like, comment on, click or share a story. We will rank stories higher in feed which we think people might take action on, and which people might want to see near the top of their News Feed. How will this affect my Page? The impact of these changes on a story’s distribution will vary depending on the composition of your audience and your posting activity. In general this update should not impact reach or referral traffic meaningfully for the majority of Pages; however, some Pages may see some increases in referral traffic, and some Pages may see some declines in referral traffic. Pages might see some declines in referral traffic if the rate at which their stories are clicked on does not match how much people report wanting to see those stories near the top of their News Feed. This update helps rebalance those two factors, so people are seeing relevant stories to them. In general, Pages should avoid encouraging people to take an action (such as encouraging lots of clicks), because this will likely only cause temporary spikes in metrics that might then be rebalanced by feed’s ranking over time. As this change takes effect, we’ll be learning about what possible factors or posting strategies may lead to increases or declines in referral traffic, and we are committed to communicating with our partners about those findings. Look for updates at our News Feed Best Practices page, and in the News, Media and Publishing Facebook group. Overall, Pages should continue to post things that your audience finds meaningful and continue using our Page post best practices."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2016/01/expanding-live-video/","date":"2016-01-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Expanding Live Video to More People","text":"By Vadim Lavrusik, Product Manager In December, we started testing the ability for people to share live video on Facebook, and it has been inspiring to see all the ways that people have used Live to connect with their friends and family.

By Justin Osofsky, Vice President of Global Operations, and Todd Gage, Product Manager Facebook is a place where people share and connect with their family and friends. In order for this to happen, people need to feel safe and be confident they know who they are communicating with. On Facebook, we require people to use the name their friends and family know them by. When people use the names they are known by, their actions and words carry more weight because they are more accountable for what they say. It also makes it harder for bullies to anonymously smear the reputations of others, or anyone else to use an anonymous name to harass, scam or engage in criminal behavior. We’re firmly committed to this policy, and it is not changing. However, after hearing feedback from our community, we recognize that it’s also important that this policy works for everyone, especially for communities who are marginalized or face discrimination. That’s why we’re continuing to make improvements in this area. Today, we will begin to test new tools that address two key goals. First, we want to reduce the number of people who are asked to verify their name on Facebook when they are already using the name people know them by. Second, we want to make it easier for people to confirm their name if necessary. These tools have been built based on many conversations with community leaders and safety organizations around the world. A new version of names reporting that requires people to provide context We are introducing a new version of the names reporting process that requires people to provide additional information about why they are reporting a name. In the past, people were able to simply report a “fake name” but now they will be required to go through several new steps that provide us more specifics about the report. This additional context will help our review teams better understand why someone is reporting a name, giving them more information about a specific situation. A new way for people to describe their special circumstance when verifying their name We’re also testing a new tool that will let people provide more information about their circumstances if they are asked to verify their name. People can let us know they have a special circumstance, and then give us more information about their unique situation. This additional information will help our review teams better understand the situation so they can provide more personalized support. This information will also help inform potential improvements we can make in the future. In addition to these two improvements, over the last year, we made several other changes to our processes to make sure they work for everyone. We expanded the options and documents that everyone on Facebook can use to verify their name. We started rolling out a new process in which people will have access to their account for seven days while they verify or update their name. We also implemented additional security protections for documents that people share with us when they are verifying their name. These improvements are only the beginning. Early in the new year, we will be looking at other ways we can reduce the number of people who have to go through an ID verification experience, while preserving the safety of other people on the site. We will also continue to work on making the experience itself more compassionate and easier to navigate. Throughout this process, we will continue our ongoing conversations with the Facebook community so they can share their thoughts on improvements they’d like to see. These tools are currently being tested on a limited basis in the US only, across mobile and desktop. Based on feedback, we will iterate and roll them out globally. We want to create the best experience that we can for everyone, and we will continue to make improvements until everyone can use the name that their friends and family know them by."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/12/news-feed-fyi-continuing-to-build-news-feed-for-all-types-of-connections/","date":"2015-12-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Continuing to Build News Feed for All Types of Connections","text":"Our mission with News Feed is to connect people with the stories that matter most to them, but if people’s News Feeds aren’t loading because of poor internet connection, we can’t show them the most relevant stories. People are coming online at a staggering rate in emerging markets and, in most cases, are doing so on mobile via 2G connections.

We want to make sure that everyone who uses News Feed can understand what updates we’re making and the thinking behind them. That’s why we continue to publish News Feed FYI blog posts to explain major updates and how we’re working to get better at showing you the stories that matter most to you. The actions people take on Facebook—liking, clicking, commenting or sharing a post—are some of the main factors we consider to determine what to show at the top of your News Feed. We’ve learned that honing in on how to value these signals helps make sure we show you the most relevant content. As part of our ongoing effort to improve News Feed, we ask thousands of people every day to rate their experience and tell us how we can improve what they see when they check Facebook. People also take story surveys where they see two stories that could be in their News Feed and answer which they’d most want to see. We compare their answer to the order we would have put these stories in their News Feed. If the story picked is the one News Feed would have shown higher up, that’s a good sign that things are working well. If the story picked is the one we would have put lower down, this highlights an area for improvement. Viral Stories Sometimes stories on Facebook go viral, where millions of people see the same video, photo, or other post. It’s hard to predict when or why posts go viral. Sometimes this happens because lots of people are really interested in seeing that particular post. However, sometimes a post goes viral and many people tell us that they weren’t interested in seeing it, despite lots of people liking, sharing and commenting on it. One example of a type of viral post that people report they don’t enjoy seeing in their News Feed are hoaxes. If there is a viral story about a hoax, it can get a lot of reshares and comments, which would normally help us infer it might be an interesting story. However, we’ve heard feedback that people don’t want to see these stories as much as other posts in their News Feed. We survey tens of thousands of people every day, and for the story surveys, we ask them if they prefer a particular viral post to another post. With this update, if a significant amount of people tell us they would prefer to see other posts more than that particular viral post, we’ll take that into account when ranking, so that viral post might show up lower in people’s feeds in the future, since it might not actually be interesting to people. With the hoaxes example, if the majority of people taking the survey say they would rather see another story in their feed than the viral hoax story, then we’ll infer the story might not be as interesting, and show the viral story lower down in people’s feeds in the future. If there is a viral story that people do choose to see in the survey, there will be no change to how it is ranked. As viral posts are typically anomalies, and not an important part of distribution for Pages, we don’t think this change will impact your Page’s distribution."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/12/introducing-live-video-and-collages/","date":"2015-12-02T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Live Video and Collages","text":"By Vadim Lavrusik, Product Manager and Thai Tran, Product Manager Now you can bring the photos and videos you share on Facebook to life with live video and collages, to help friends and family feel like they’re in the moment with you.

We hope these tools will help people end relationships on Facebook with greater ease, comfort and sense of control."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/11/introducing-new-tools-for-nonprofits/","date":"2015-11-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Introducing New Tools for Nonprofits","text":"By Naomi Gleit, VP of Product Management With more than 150 million people around the world connected to a cause, Facebook is a global community of volunteers, donors and activists coming together to make the world a better place. People raise money for disaster relief, they search for missing children, and they bring attention to the issues they care about. We’ve seen from our community that when people take action, lives are changed. We know we can do more to enable these connections. Today we’re testing fundraisers – a new tool – and improving our Donate button, to allow people to donate to charities without leaving Facebook. We hope these features help nonprofits reach new supporters, engage their community and get the valuable funding they need to continue their good work. In 2013, we first tested different ways for nonprofits to fundraise on Facebook. As a company we have also partnered with organizations to create donation campaigns after major natural disasters, like the Nepal earthquake. And we hope these new tools will help these groups do even more. A new place to fundraise Fundraisers are a dedicated place to raise funds from a nonprofit’s Page for a specific campaign. Nonprofits can tell their campaign story, rally supporters, collect donations and visibly track progress toward a goal for year-end drives, themed campaigns and special projects such as building a clean water well or funding a clothing drive. People will be able to donate in just a few taps and share their donations with friends. All shared posts will also include a Donate button, making it easy for anyone who sees it to donate and join the fundraiser directly from News Feed. A Donate button for Pages and posts To help nonprofits increase donations, we’re improving our Donate button and making it available on Pages and posts. Adding a Donate button to a Page will give a nonprofit a consistent place to collect donations, even as they update their Page’s content. Including a Donate button on a post will give people an easy way to donate directly from News Feed. Both of these buttons will make it easy for supporters to contribute using a one-page form without leaving Facebook, and share that they donated with their friends. Learn More We’re currently testing these experiences with 37 partner organizations including Mercy Corps, National Multiple Sclerosis Society and World Wildlife Fund. We’re committed to expanding these tools to as many organizations as possible in the future. Soon, we will be making them available to other US-based 501c3 nonprofits. Organizations interested in using these tools can sign up to learn more. We’re excited to build more tools that can help nonprofits do more good in the world. Update as of 6/30/2016: Today we will be expanding fundraisers to allow people to raise money for US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofits directly on Facebook. Fundraisers allow supporters to set up a dedicated page to share their story, tell others about a nonprofit’s mission and rally around a fundraising goal. With more than 100 nonprofits to choose from at launch, people in the US can create fundraisers and people in 39 countries can donate to their friends’ fundraisers. We will be looking to expand the list of nonprofits you can fundraise for soon, with a goal of making this available widely to 501(c)(3) organizations over the coming year. We are also inviting any US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit to sign up here to get access to this new tool.

With over 1.5 billion searches per day and over 2 trillion posts in our index, search is an important, long-term effort at Facebook. The team’s goal with Search FYI is to share our progress more frequently. When something happens in the world, people often turn to Facebook to see how their friends and family are reacting. Today, we’re updating Facebook Search so that in addition to friends and family, you can find out what the world is saying about topics that matter to you: Better search suggestions: When you tap into the search box and start typing, we’ll now offer timely, personalized search suggestions. As you type, we’ll highlight things that are happening right now so you can follow popular stories as they unfold. Search results with public posts and posts from friends: When you search, you’ll now see the most recent, relevant public posts along with posts from your friends. Search results are organized to help you cut through the noise and quickly understand what the world is saying about a topic in the moment. You also can pull-to-refresh and see the latest public posts. Find public conversations with search: When a link gets shared widely on Facebook, it often anchors an interesting public conversation. Now there’s a new way to quickly dive into that discussion. With one tap, you can find public posts about a link, see popular quotes and phrases mentioned in these posts, and check out an aggregate overview of sentiment. This feature is a first step—we look forward to people using it and giving us feedback so we can make it even better. Here’s a quick overview of how these updates work. You can also see for yourself; try searching “Halloween Costumes” or “Mets World Series.” The diverse experiences and perspectives that are shared on Facebook can’t be found anywhere else. Your search results are personalized and unique to you and, as always, you can only see things that have been shared with you. Likewise, you control who can see your posts on Facebook and it’s easy to change the audience of your past posts any time. Today’s updates are rolling out now in US English on iPhone, Android and desktop. We’re excited to take another step toward helping you find what matters.

It has become an integral part of how people around the world discover, watch and share videos they care about every day. Today, we want to provide another update on some of the things we’ve been working on over the past year, along with some of the new features you may see in the coming months. New Immersive Video Formats In August, we announced that public figures can share live video with their fans via Mentions, and we’ve seen thousands of authentic and candid live videos, from Vin Diesel to Serena Williams and many more. We rolled out 360 video on Facebook in September, enabling people to view a video from all angles right in News Feed. Star Wars and Discovery were among the first publishers to share these stunning videos on Facebook. New Video Tests We know people enjoy these more immersive video experiences, but we’re also learning that people want to watch videos in different ways at different times. We have been testing a number of new features that give people more flexibility when watching videos, whether you’re watching a video in News Feed on-the-go or sitting down to enjoy multiple videos back-to-back. Suggested videos is one of the features we’ve been testing on iPhone, making it easy to discover multiple related videos in a row after you tap on a video from News Feed. While we’re still in the early days of testing, we’re pleased with initial results, which show that people who have suggested videos are discovering and watching more new videos. We’ve now rolled out suggested videos to most people on iPhone globally, and are starting to test ads within the experience. We are also starting to test this on the web, and plan to test on Android phones in the coming months. In addition to helping people find more videos they may be interested in, we know people sometimes want to multitask while they watch videos. To make this possible, we’re testing a way for people to watch a video in a floating screen while simultaneously multitasking on Facebook. We also know that sometimes people want to watch a video, but they don’t have time or aren’t in a place where they can turn on sound. To make it easy to return to the videos you’re interested in, we’ve been testing a button that allows you to save a video to watch later, which can be accessed in your “Saved” bookmark. Lastly, we’ll be testing a dedicated place on Facebook for people to go when they exclusively want to watch video—whether that’s videos they’ve saved for later, or videos from friends, Pages they follow, and other video publishers on Facebook. This new videos section helps people discover, watch and share videos on Facebook that are relevant to them. It can be accessed by tapping a “Videos” icon at the bottom of the Facebook app on iPhone or in the “Favorites” section on the left-hand side of News Feed on the web. We’ll be testing this with a small number of people now, so this isn’t something most people will see on Facebook right away. We look forward to seeing how people use it to discover, watch and share videos with their friends. Tools for Publishers We’ve also been working on a number of features for publishers to help them better manage and control their videos on Facebook. We recently began testing new video matching technology with a set of partners, with the long-term goal of providing a comprehensive video management system for creators. We’ve also rolled out new video tools for Pages — like updates to Page Insights and video upload improvements — to help video publishers grow their businesses on Facebook. The last few years have been exciting for video, and we look forward to seeing more people discover the videos that matter to them on Facebook."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/10/news-feed-fyi-how-the-reactions-test-will-impact-ranking/","date":"2015-10-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"How the Reactions Test Will Impact Ranking","text":"By Chris Tosswill, Product Manager Today we are beginning to test Reactions – an extension of the Like button that gives people more ways to share their reaction to a post in a quick and easy way. We’re excited to start this test, but understand that this is a big change, and one that we want to make sure to get right. So we’re starting by offering Reactions to Ireland and Spain, where people will be able to react to any post across Facebook – a post from a friend, advertiser, publisher or business. Our goal is to show you the stories that matter most to you in News Feed. Initially, just as we do when someone likes a post, if someone uses a Reaction, we will infer they want to see more of that type of post. We will spend time learning from this initial rollout and iterate based on findings in the future. Will this impact my Page? We see this as an opportunity for businesses and publishers to better understand how people are responding to their content on Facebook. During this test, Page owners will be able to see Reactions to all of their posts on Page insights. Reactions will have the same impact on ad delivery as Likes do. We will spend time learning from this initial test and use that feedback to improve. Overall, Pages should continue to post things that their audience finds meaningful and continue using our Page post best practices. We want to hear from people who use Facebook what works and what doesn’t during this test, before we make this change for everyone. Stay tuned!"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/10/news-feed-fyi-building-for-all-connectivity/","date":"2015-10-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Building for All Connectivity","text":"By Chris Marra, Emerging Markets Product Manager and Alex Sourov, Emerging Markets Engineering Manager People are coming online at a staggering rate in emerging markets and, in most cases, are doing so on mobile via 2G connections. In order to make sure another billion people can connect using Facebook we need to design features of the product that work seamlessly regardless of mobile network and device. What this means for those of us on the News Feed team is making sure people can load and scroll through News Feed on any connection speed. We’ve worked on a few updates recently to improve the experience so it works seamlessly and quickly for people in all parts of the world. Taking connection speed into account There are many factors we take into account in News Feed to make sure you’re seeing the most relevant stories for you – even the type of device you’re on or the speed of your mobile network or wifi connection. Taking this into account helps us determine what kinds of stories to show you in News Feed. For example, if you are on a slower internet connection that won’t load videos, News Feed will show you fewer videos and more status updates and links. In order to simplify the way we distinguish between different types of networks, we developed an open-sourced Network Connection Class, which is a way for us to determine how fast your connection is. With recent updates, we can now start retrieving more stories and photos while you are reading News Feed on slower connections to make sure stories are always available as you keep scrolling. So if you are reading a post from your friend about their weekend, but doing so on a slower connection, we will load more stories while you’re reading so they are ready for you when you’re done reading that post. Downloading stories you’re looking at first If you are on a poor internet connection and your News Feed is loading slowly, we will first download the story you’re currently looking at, rather than download a series of News Feed stories. For example, if you are looking at a photo your friend posted or a photo from a Page you’ve liked, that isn’t fully downloaded, we prioritize that photo over loading a story below it that you aren’t currently looking at, so you can see the most important photos you’re viewing as quickly as possible. We’re also investing in the best image formats for photo loading. We recently moved to a Progressive JPEG photo format which allows us to start showing lower-quality versions of photos while they’re still downloading, so you can see some of the photo instead of nothing. This lowers the amount of data required to send photos to be loaded, and speeds up the wait time for photos. We made this change for iOS at the beginning of the year and now use the same technology on both iOS and Android. Showing you stories when on particularly poor connections Sometimes we are unable to load any new News Feed stories if a connection is particularly congested or poor quality. People have told us that when they visit News Feed they’d rather see stories that may have loaded on a previous visit than not see any stories at all. So now when you leave News Feed and then come back again on a bad connection, we will display previously downloaded stories. You can scroll down and see stories from your previous visit to News Feed until you are able to connect again to a mobile network. For example, if you were to open News Feed on an airplane you’d still be able to read stories you scrolled past previously, when you did have a connection, instead of just waiting for anything to load. Even though we load stories from previous visits to News Feed, we don’t re-retrieve these stories that you have already seen, so we aren’t wasting more data. However, if something about the story has changed — for example if the number of comments and likes has changed or if the post was deleted — we will make updates when you see the story again."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/09/improving-mobile-profiles/","date":"2015-09-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Improving Mobile Profiles","text":"By Aigerim Shorman and Tony Hsieh, Product Managers People visit Facebook profiles more than four billion times per day, and we’re continually looking for ways to make profiles the best place for people to curate their online identities and connect with others. Today, we’re unveiling some new, mobile-friendly features for Facebook profiles. There are three main improvements that will give you more opportunities to express who you are and control the content showcased on your profile. Bring Your Profile to Life The world has changed since we first introduced profiles in 2004. On News Feed and profiles, we’re seeing people create and view more videos than ever before. Today we’re starting to test the next step in an obvious evolution of profiles: profile videos. Soon, you’ll be able to film a short, looping video clip that will play for anyone who visits your profile. Profile videos will let show a part of yourself you couldn’t before, and add a new dimension to your profile. We’re not ignoring profile pictures either; we’ve also built some new features that will help you better let your personality shine through your profile picture. When more than 26 million people used our Celebrate Pride filter, it was more apparent than ever that people use their profile picture to show who they are— even if it’s just for a moment in time. Profile pictures are not just static portraits. They represent what’s going in your life right now and what’s important to you, and we want to give people the tools to better express themselves in this way. As part of that effort, we’ve started to roll out the ability to set a temporary version of your profile picture that reverts back to your previous profile picture at a specified time. Want to support your team in the week leading up to the big game, commemorate a special milestone like a birthday or vacation or show off a great #tbt picture? Now you can create a temporary profile picture specifically for those moments and events. It can be a visual status update to let your friends know what’s going on in your life today, or it can be your statement of solidarity for a cause you feel strongly about. Improved Profile Controls You’ve always been able to control who can see the information you showcase on your profile, and now we’re making it easier for you to see what others can view by introducing a new customizable space at the top of your profile. You can curate this space— and convey what you want people to know about you— by changing the visibility of the fields that show up here. You can also fill out the new, one-line ‘Bio’ field: select certain public About fields like work and education details to appear there; and even visually highlight what’s important to you by choosing up to five Featured Photos to be showcased at the top of your profile. While this space is visible to anyone who visits your profile, you have full control of what information appears here. Design Improvements to Your Mobile Profile Along with these new profile features, we’ve made some design changes to mobile profile that improve the profile layout and better present information about you and your friends in a more visually engaging way. We’re moving your profile picture and video to literally put you front-and-center on your profile. Profile pictures are now centered, and we’ve made them bigger to give you more real estate to show off what you can do with our new creative tools. We’ve also made some small changes that will help you learn more about the people you’ve just met and ensure you see the most interesting visual highlights from the friends you already know. People love seeing photos and mutual friends when viewing the profiles of friends or someone they’ve just met, so those are easier to see now on profile. Photos and friends are right at the top, making getting to know someone and seeing the world through your friends’ eyes as easy as scrolling. We’re starting to test all of these features to a small number of iPhone users in the UK and California, and we’ll be rolling them out to more people soon. We believe these improvements to profile will give people more ways to connect and share with each other, and express themselves in meaningful ways. We can’t wait to see how people use them."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/09/updates-for-facebook-notes/","date":"2015-09-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Updates for Facebook Notes","text":"By Isaac Salier-Hellendag, User Interface Engineer We’re rolling out an update to make notes on Facebook more beautiful and customizable. Notes are now an even better way to write a longer post and share with anyone — whether it’s a small group of friends or everyone on Facebook. With this update, you can add a cover photo that represents what your note is all about. You can caption and resize photos, and format your text into headers, quotes or bullets. For instance, you can recap your summer vacation or an important time in your life to update the people you care about. You can voice your opinion on something you saw in the news or write an open letter you want to share with the world. You can share a special recipe with a bulleted list of ingredients and photos of each step. Facebook has always been a place to share your thoughts with friends, and notes are a meaningful way for people to do that. For example, Jeff Nunokawa enjoys creative writing, and every day since 2007, he has written a note inspired by a different quote. With this update, Jeff has a better way of bringing his words to life and connecting with his friends on Facebook. You’ll be able to create these new notes on the web, and they’re fully viewable on mobile. To see notes your friends have written or write your own, visit Facebook.com/notes or search “notes” on mobile."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/09/update-to-internet-org-free-basic-services/","date":"2015-09-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Internet.org","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Update to Internet.org Free Basic Services","text":"Starting today, more than one billion people who have access to Internet.org’s free basic services across Asia, Africa and Latin America will now be able to access more free services through the Free Basics Platform. In May we introduced the Platform as a way for developers to easily create services that integrate with Internet.org, and a way to give people more choice and control over the services they access. Starting today, the Platform is now live. Over the past few months, developers have adapted their services specifically for the Free Basics Platform requirements, and today, more than 60 new services are available across the 19 countries where free basic services are available. Not only does this expand the range of resources available to people, it gives them more choice and control over the services they can use in the app and website. The program is making an impact on people’s lives by providing free health, education, and economic information. For instance, SmartBusiness, a website that helps people learn to launch and run a business, now sees 5x more daily searches within their service since launching in South Africa in July, meaning more people are getting access to important economic information. BabyCenter and MAMA both reach millions of people around the globe with vital health information for pregnancy and parenting, including 3.4 million people through Internet.org’s free basics services alone. Starting today, people using the app or mobile web version can navigate to a menu where they can select which services to add to their list of free services. They can also search for a service by name or description. Commitment to security and privacy With Free Basics, Internet.org is making it safer for people to connect to the websites and services they care about by encrypting information wherever possible. Several months ago we announced support for services using HTTPS in the Free Basics Android app, and today, we’re adding support for HTTPS services on the web version as well. And even if the service you access only runs over HTTP, we encrypt that information between our servers and any device that supports HTTPS. Read more about our commitment to security and privacy for Free Basics here. Free Basics by Facebook Today we’re also announcing a new name for the app and mobile website — Free Basics by Facebook. We’re making this change to better distinguish the Internet.org initiative from the programs and services we’re providing, including Free Basics. Anyone currently using the app will be able to continue using the Android app, though it will now be called Free Basics by Facebook in Google Play. And the mobile web version, which will redirect from the previous URL, can be accessed at FreeBasics.com. Developers building for the Platform If you’re a developer interested in submitting your service to be part of the Free Basics Platform, you can learn more on our developer page here. We’re also clarifying the guidelines for developers building for the Platform to make them simpler after listening to feedback — you can see the updated guidelines here."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/09/introducing-360-video-on-facebook/","date":"2015-09-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing 360 Video on Facebook","text":"By Maher Saba, Engineering Director, Video Starting today, 360-degree videos will begin rolling out in News Feed. Our goal at Facebook is to connect you with the people and things that matter, every single day. Over time, we’ve seen that people enjoy more immersive content in their News Feeds. This is one reason video has been so successful on Facebook, and we’re excited to take it a step further with 360 video. To create 360 videos, a special set of cameras is used to record all 360 degrees of a scene simultaneously. This means that when the video is playing on Facebook, you can choose what angle you want to see it from. On the web you can do this by dragging around the video with your cursor, and on mobile devices you do it by dragging with your finger — or even just by turning your device. You’ll be able to hold up your phone and the 360 video will follow you as you turn, looking around, to experience things from all over the world like never before. In the future, imagine watching 360 videos of a friend’s vacation to a small village in France or a festival in Brazil — you’ll be able to look around and experience it as if you were there. Along with updates from your friends and family, you will also be able to discover amazing new content on Facebook from media companies, organizations, and individual creators. There are a number of publishers sharing new 360 videos on Facebook today, including Star Wars, Discovery, GoPro, LeBron James & Uninterrupted, NBC’s Saturday Night Live, and VICE. These videos help show the range of possibilities with this new medium. For example, Disney and Lucasfilm are debuting an exclusive 360 experience from its upcoming movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens, bringing fans inside the beloved Star Wars universe. There’s also a whole world of video creators and storytellers who are at the cutting edge of exploring this medium, and over the coming days they too will be able to upload their 360 videos to Facebook. We’re excited to see more innovative and compelling 360 videos being shared from these publishers. If you’re using Facebook on the web or on Android, you should be able to see 360 videos in News Feed soon. We plan to roll this out for iOS in the coming months. It’s early days, but we’re excited about the possibilities for 360 video and hope it helps people explore the world in new, immersive ways. Updated 11/12/15: Starting today, people around the world are now able to watch 360 videos on their iOS devices. As with Android devices, you can explore a 360 video on iPhone by dragging around the video with your finger to see different angles, or simply by turning your device while a 360 video is playing. Additionally, people using a Samsung Gear VR and supported Samsung smartphone can easily play 360 videos from News Feed in their Gear VR."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/08/connect-with-public-figures-through-live/","date":"2015-08-04T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Connect with Public Figures Through Live","text":"By Vadim Lavrusik, Product Manager We’re excited to introduce a new way for you to connect and interact with your favorite public figures on Facebook — through live video.

You can discover these live videos from public figures you follow in your News Feed. You can comment on, like or share the video while watching a live broadcast. You can also see when your friends or other public figures start watching. Live is an immersive and authentic way to connect with the public figures you care about, in real-time. If you don’t catch the live broadcast, you can also watch the video later on the public figure’s Page.

The actions people take on Facebook—liking, commenting or sharing a post—are some of the main factors we consider to determine what to show at the top of your News Feed. We also offer the option to hide stories that you don’t want to see in News Feed. This helps us learn the kinds of stories you don’t enjoy, so we can do a better job in the future. Many people choose to hide stories they don’t like, but most people do this only occasionally. Hiding something is usually a strong indication that someone didn’t want to see a particular post. There is also a small group of people on Facebook who hide a very high number of stories in their News Feed. In fact, some people hide almost every post in their News Feed, even after they’ve liked or commented on posts. For this group of people, “hide” isn’t as strong a negative signal, and in fact they may still want to see similar stories to the ones they’ve hidden in the future. To do a better job of serving this small group, we made a small update to News Feed so that, for these people only, we don’t take “hide” into account as strongly as before. As a result, this group of people has started seeing more stories from the Pages and friends they are connected to than in the past. Overall, this tweak helps this group see more of the stuff they are interested in. How will this affect my Page? This update means that the small group of people who hide many stories will start to see more stories in their News Feed, and so will likely hide more stories overall. This means that the total number of hidden stories across Facebook will increase – so Page admins may see an increase in this metric in their Page Insights. We do not expect Pages to see significant changes in distribution as a result of this update."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/07/enhancing-security-with-a-quick-checkup/","date":"2015-07-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Integrity & Security"],"title":"Enhancing Security with a Quick Checkup","text":"By Melissa Luu-Van, Product Manager We want everyone to have a safe experience on Facebook.

The first step helps you log out of devices you haven’t used in a while or forgot about, so you’re only logged into Facebook where you want to be. Next, you can turn on a feature called login alerts, which lets you know if anyone else tries to log into your account. We’ll send you a notification or email alert if someone tries to log into your account from an unfamiliar device or browser. Finally, check out a few tips for how to keep your password strong and unique. We recommend not using your Facebook password anywhere else online, never sharing it with anyone, and avoiding common words that may be easy to guess. In just a few easy steps, your account gets some extra protection and you get some extra peace of mind. You can also use Security Checkup at any time here. Security Checkup is now available globally on desktop and will be coming to mobile soon. (Update on August 24, 2016: Security Checkup is now available globally on desktop, Android and iOS.) Remember, you can always access the full list of available security tools and features by visiting facebook.com/settings and clicking the Security tab."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/07/updated-controls-for-news-feed/","date":"2015-07-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI","Product News"],"title":"Updated Controls for News Feed","text":"By Jacob Frantz, Product Manager News Feed is a personalized stream of stories that you build from the people and Pages you’ve connected to on Facebook. The goal of News Feed is to show you the stories that matter most to you. To do this, we use ranking to order stories based on how interesting we believe they are to you: specifically, whom you tend to interact with, and what kinds of content you tend to like and comment on. We’re always working to improve and personalize your News Feed experience. We know that ultimately you’re the only one who truly knows what is most meaningful to you and that is why we want to give you more ways to control what you see. Last year we announced some new ways to control what you see in News Feed. Today we are announcing even better tools for you to actively shape and improve the experience. We’ve redesigned and expanded Facebook’s News Feed Preferences to give you more control. Select friends and Pages to see first To help prioritize stories, and make sure you don’t miss posts from particular friends and Pages, you can now select which friends and Pages you would like to see at the top of your News Feed. Within News Feed Preferences, tap on a friend’s profile picture to see their posts first. You will then see any new stories they’ve shared since your last visit to Facebook at the top of News Feed, with a star in the top right of their post so you know why they’re at the top. You can scroll down to see the rest of your News Feed normally. Find new Pages to connect to Helping you find new Pages to follow can help you connect with publishers, artists and businesses you might be interested in. Based on the types of Pages you’ve liked in the past, you can discover new Pages in order to get more of the stories you care about. Select which friends and Pages to follow or unfollow With an updated design of the tools we previously launched, you can now see a list of the top people, Pages and groups that you’ve seen in your News Feed over the past week, and choose to unfollow any friend, Page or group if you don’t want to see their updates. You can also see who you’ve unfollowed in the past and choose to re-follow them at any time. To get to News Feed Preferences, tap More in the bottom right hand corner of your mobile app. News Feed Preferences are located under Settings. You can come back at any time to update your choices. The new ways to control your News Feed will be available today on iOS and will be rolling out on Android and desktop over the coming weeks."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/06/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-more-actions-on-videos/","date":"2015-06-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Taking into Account More Actions on Videos","text":"By Meihong Wang, Engineering Manager, and Yue Zhuo, Software Engineer The goal of News Feed is to show you the stories that matter most to you. As part of our ongoing effort to improve News Feed, we asked people to rate their experience and tell us how we can improve the content they see when they check Facebook. One of the most significant findings from this work is that there are many times people don’t want to like, comment on, or share a post, but this does not mean it wasn’t meaningful to them. We recently shared that we now take into account the amount of time people spend on a particular story relative to other content in their News Feed. We have learned that certain actions people take on a video, such as choosing to turn on sound or making the video full screen, are good signs they wanted to see that video, even if they didn’t want to like it. Today, we want to share an update to News Feed ranking that takes into account these actions to help people see more of the videos they care about and fewer of the videos they don’t. Taking Actions on Videos We have previously made updates to News Feed that take into account whether someone has watched a video and for how long they watched it, so people who tend to watch videos in News Feed will see more videos higher up in their News Feed, and people who watch fewer videos will see videos further down. With this update, we want to show people more of the types of videos they want to see, and fewer of the videos they don’t. Many people have told us that they enjoy watching videos in News Feed but don’t always feel inclined to like, comment or share them. For example, you may have found a video from a nonprofit you follow on Facebook to be really informative and you’re glad you saw it but it’s not something you felt inclined to like, comment on or share more broadly. We are now taking into account more interactions with videos that we have learned indicate whether someone found that video interesting, such as choosing to turn on sound, making the video full screen, and enabling high definition. So if you turn the volume up or make the video full screen, we have updated News Feed to infer you liked the video and will show you similar videos higher up in your News Feed. We have found that this helps us show people more videos that they are interested in. We’ve just started rolling this out and will continue to do so over the coming weeks. We do not expect most Pages to see significant changes in distribution as a result of this update."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/06/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-time-spent-on-stories/","date":"2015-06-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Taking Into Account Time Spent on Stories","text":"By Ansha Yu, Software Engineer and Sami Tas, Software Engineer The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. The actions people take on Facebook—liking, commenting or sharing a post—are historically some of the main factors we’ve considered to determine what to show at the top of your News Feed. But these factors don’t always tell us the whole story of what is most meaningful to you. Recently, as part of our ongoing effort to improve News Feed, we asked people to rate their experience and tell us how we can improve the content they see when they check Facebook. From this research, we learned that in many cases, just because someone didn’t like, comment or share a story in their News Feed doesn’t mean it wasn’t meaningful to them. There are times when, for example, people want to see information about a serious current event, but don’t necessarily want to like or comment on it. Based on this finding, we are updating News Feed’s ranking to factor in a new signal—how much time you spend viewing a story in your News Feed. Taking the time to read When talking to people about the way they use their News Feed, we’ve found that it’s not as simple as just measuring the number of seconds you spend on each story to understand if that piece of content resonated with you. Some people may spend ten seconds on a story because they really enjoy it, while others may spend ten seconds on a story because they have a slow internet connection. We’ve discovered that if people spend significantly more time on a particular story in News Feed than the majority of other stories they look at, this is a good sign that content was relevant to them. For example, you may scroll quickly through your News Feed and like a photo of your friend’s graduation, followed by sharing a funny post from your sister. You keep scrolling and happen upon a post your cousin shared detailing everything she did and saw on her recent trip. Her post even includes a photo. You spend time reading her post and the interesting discussion about the best places to eat that had broken out in the comments on this post, but you don’t feel inclined to like or comment on it yourself. Based on the fact that you didn’t scroll straight past this post and it was on the screen for more time than other posts that were in your News Feed, we infer that it was something you found interesting and we may start to surface more posts like that higher up in your News Feed in the future. We’ve started rolling this out and will continue over the coming weeks. We do not expect Pages to see significant changes in distribution as a result of this update."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/06/announcing-facebook-lite/","date":"2015-06-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Announcing Facebook Lite","text":"By Vijay Shankar, Product Manager for Facebook Lite Today we’re introducing Facebook Lite, a new version of Facebook for Android that uses less data and works well across all network conditions.

This has led to questions about whether this creates filter bubbles where people only see information from like-minded individuals, and whether algorithms used to rank search results and social media posts contribute to this. Our latest research, released today in Science, quantifies for the first time exactly how much ideologically diverse news and information individuals are exposed to in social media. We found that most people have friends who claim an opposing political ideology, and that the content in peoples’ News Feeds reflect those diverse views. News Feed surfaces content that is slightly more aligned with an individual’s own ideology, however the friends you choose and the content you click on are more important factors than News Feed ranking in terms of how much content you encounter that cuts across ideological lines. Specifically, we find that among those who self-report a liberal or conservative affiliation: On average 23% of people’s friends claim an opposing political ideology Of the hard news content that people’s friends share, 29.5% of it cuts across ideological lines When it comes to what people see in News Feed, 28.9% of the hard news encountered cuts across ideological lines, on average 24.9% of the hard news content that people actually clicked on cuts across ideological lines Read more about our research and findings on our Data Science blog."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/04/news-feed-fyi-balancing-content-from-friends-and-pages/","date":"2015-04-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Inside Feed","News Feed FYI"],"title":"Balancing Content from Friends and Pages","text":"By Max Eulenstein, Product Manager and Lauren Scissors, User Experience Researcher The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. This means we need to give you the right mix of updates from friends and public figures, publishers, businesses and community organizations you are connected to. This balance is different for everyone depending on what people are most interested in learning about every day. As more people and pages are sharing more content, we need to keep improving News Feed to get this balance right. What are today’s updates? We get a lot of feedback from people and recently started asking people to rate their personal News Feeds to tell us how we can improve. Based on this feedback and our ongoing understanding of how people use News Feed, we are making three updates. The first is improving the experience for people who don’t have a lot of content available to see. Previously, we had rules in place to prevent you from seeing multiple posts from the same source in a row. With this update, we are relaxing this rule. Now if you run out of content, but want to spend more time in News Feed, you’ll see more. We’ve also learned that people are worried about missing important updates from the friends they care about. For people with many connections this is particularly important, as there is a lot of content for them to see each day. The second update tries to ensure that content posted directly by the friends you care about, such as photos, videos, status updates or links, will be higher up in News Feed so you are less likely to miss it. If you like to read news or interact with posts from pages you care about, you will still see that content in News Feed. This update tries to make the balance of content the right one for each individual person. Lastly, many people have told us they don’t enjoy seeing stories about their friends liking or commenting on a post. This update will make these stories appear lower down in News Feed or not at all, so you are more likely to see the stuff you care about directly from friends and the pages you have liked. Will this affect my page? The impact of these changes on your page’s distribution will vary considerably depending on the composition of your audience and your posting activity. In some cases, post reach and referral traffic could potentially decline. Overall, pages should continue to post things that your audience finds meaningful and continue using our Page post best practices."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/03/a-new-way-to-organize-photos-of-your-child-on-facebook/","date":"2015-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"A New Way to Organize Photos of Your Child on Facebook","text":"By Dan Barak, Product Manager As a new dad who loves photography, I enjoy taking pictures of my son and sharing them with friends and family around the world. I believe these photos help us all feel closer and more connected. Over the past few months, I’ve noticed the more pictures I shared of my son on Facebook, the more scattered they became across my different photo albums—I needed a better way to organize them. And, I found myself tagging my wife in photos of my son so her friends could see them, too. Our team ran a small survey for parents who share pictures of their children on Facebook and found that 65% of them tag their partner in these photos to share them with their partner’s friends. These same parents also told us they want to collect photos of their little ones in a place that will grow with them over the years. With these insights in mind, we set out to help people who are already sharing and tagging photos of their children on Facebook have a better experience. We’re starting to pilot an optional way for you to organize photos of your child, using a special tag you choose to create. If you choose to tag your child in a photo it will be added to a customizable scrapbook. And, photos you choose to tag can be shared with your friends and your partner’s friends. Here’s a quick overview of how it works: Photos of my son are the most important pictures my wife and I will ever take. It’s important to us that we’re in control of these photos. I believe other parents want the same thing, so: You can opt to co-own the scrapbook with a partner who you’re in a relationship with on Facebook. You choose what you call the tag—it could be your child’s name, initials or something fun. You and your partner choose which photos to tag. Only you and your partner can tag your child in photos. We’ve built in lots of reminders and tips to guide you along the way. To start a scrapbook for your child, go to your profile, click on About and click on Family and Relationships. There, you’ll see an invitation to create a scrapbook; just click Get Started. If you’ve already added a child to your profile, you can click Add Scrapbook next to his or her name. This feature will start rolling out today in the US on Facebook for desktop, iPhone and Android. For more details, check out our Help Center. This project is a labor of love—my team built it based on our own experiences and what we learned from other parents. We’re excited to bring you this feature as early as possible, hear your feedback and continue building it together."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/03/introducing-on-this-day-a-new-way-to-look-back-at-photos-and-memories-on-facebook/","date":"2015-03-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing On This Day: A New Way to Look Back at Photos and Memories on Facebook","text":"For the latest information on how to use Facebook Memories, visit our Help Center.

Today we’re introducing a new feature that lets people choose a legacy contact—a family member or friend who can manage their account when they pass away. Once someone lets us know that a person has passed away, we will memorialize the account and the legacy contact will be able to: Write a post to display at the top of the memorialized Timeline (for example, to announce a memorial service or share a special message) Respond to new friend requests from family members and friends who were not yet connected on Facebook Update the profile picture and cover photo If someone chooses, they may give their legacy contact permission to download an archive of the photos, posts and profile information they shared on Facebook. Other settings will remain the same as before the account was memorialized. The legacy contact will not be able to log in as the person who passed away or see that person’s private messages. Alternatively, people can let us know if they’d prefer to have their Facebook account permanently deleted after death. Until now, when someone passed away, we offered a basic memorialized account which was viewable, but could not be managed by anyone. By talking to people who have experienced loss, we realized there is more we can do to support those who are grieving and those who want a say in what happens to their account after death. Here’s how to choose a legacy contact: Open your settings. Choose Security and then Legacy Contact at the bottom of the page. After choosing your legacy contact, you’ll have the option to send a message to that person. You may give your legacy contact permission to download an archive of the posts, photos and profile info you’ve shared on Facebook. We’ve also redesigned memorialized profiles to pay tribute to the deceased by adding “Remembering” above their name and making it possible for their legacy contact to pin a post to the top of their Timeline. We’re introducing legacy contacts in the US first and look forward to expanding to more countries. Setting up a legacy contact is completely optional. Our team at Facebook is grateful and humbled to be working on these improvements. We hope this work will help people experience loss with a greater sense of possibility, comfort and support."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2015/02/introducing-new-features-in-facebook-groups-to-improve-the-way-people-buy-and-sell/","date":"2015-02-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing New Features in Facebook Groups to Improve the Way People Buy and Sell","text":"Starting today, Facebook’s For Sale Groups will have improved features for buying and selling.

We’re always looking to people on Facebook to tell us how we can improve this experience. We’ve heard from people that they want to see fewer stories that are hoaxes, or misleading news. Today’s update to News Feed reduces the distribution of posts that people have reported as hoaxes and adds an annotation to posts that have received many of these types of reports to warn others on Facebook. We are not removing stories people report as false and we are not reviewing content and making a determination on its accuracy. What are hoaxes? Hoaxes are a form of News Feed spam that includes scams (“Click here to win a lifetime supply of coffee”), or deliberately false or misleading news stories (“Man sees dinosaur on hike in Utah”). People often share these hoaxes and later decide to delete their original posts after they realize they have been tricked. These types of posts also tend to receive lots of comments from friends letting people know this is a hoax, and comments containing links to hoax-busting websites. In fact, our testing found people are two times more likely to delete these types of posts after receiving such a comment from a friend. Recently, we added an option for people to report a story they see in News Feed as false. This works in the same way as reporting a story as spam. When you click to hide a story you also have the option to report the content. Stories that include scams, or deliberately misleading news, are reported two and a half times more often than links to other news stories. What’s the update? To reduce the number of these types of posts, News Feed will take into account when many people flag a post as false. News Feed will also take into account when many people choose to delete posts. This means a post with a link to an article that many people have reported as a hoax or chosen to delete will get reduced distribution in News Feed. This update will apply to posts including links, photos, videos and status updates. Posts that receive lots of reports will be annotated with a message warning people that many others on Facebook have reported it. Will this affect my Page? We’ve found from testing that people tend not to report satirical content intended to be humorous, or content that is clearly labeled as satire. This type of content should not be affected by this update. The vast majority of publishers on Facebook will not be impacted by this update.

The new initiative will deliver AMBER Alerts to people’s News Feeds in targeted search areas after a child has been abducted and the National Center has issued an alert. These alerts, which include photographs and other details about the missing child, are shown on mobile and desktop. People can share the alert with friends and link directly to the National Center’s missing child poster, which always has the most up-to-date information about the case. For years, people have used Facebook to post news articles about missing children and AMBER Alerts. In several cases, someone saw a post or photo in their News Feed, took action, and a child was safely returned. In 2014, an 11-year-old girl was safely recovered after a motel owner recognized her from an AMBER Alert that a friend had shared on Facebook. The woman called the police, and the child was found unharmed. It’s amazing word-of-mouth efforts like this that inspired us to develop a more systematic way to help find missing children on Facebook. We know the chances of finding a missing child increase when more people are on the lookout, especially in the critical first hours. Our goal is to help get these alerts out quickly to the people who are in the best position to help. Here’s how it works: When local or state police determine that a case qualifies for an AMBER Alert, the alert is issued by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and distributed through the Facebook system with any available information, including a photograph of the missing child, a license plate number, the name and description of the child and suspected abductor. Law enforcement determines the range of the target area for each alert. The number of alerts people will see depends on how many alerts are issued in their area — some people may see a few each year and many people will likely get no alerts at all. The alerts will appear in News Feed, but will not trigger any notifications to a person’s phone. With more than 725 children recovered as a direct result of AMBER Alerts since the program launched in 1996, we know the system works. We hope our new delivery mechanism will help increase that number and reunite even more families."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/12/updates-to-trending/","date":"2014-12-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Updates to Trending","text":"By Diana Hsu and Andrew Song, Product Managers People gather on Facebook to talk about what’s happening in the world.

Today, we’re bringing Trending to mobile and making it easy for people to explore stories from different sources. Now, when you tap on a topic in Trending, you’ll see conversations organized in up to five different sections: Articles shows you how news organizations are covering the story. In the Story shows you posts from people who are part of the story. Friends and Groups shows you what people in your network are saying. Near the Scene shows you posts from people near where the story is unfolding. Live Feed shows you a real-time stream of reactions from people around the world. The feed below the new sections will continue to display relevant posts ranked by engagement, timeliness and other factors. The way that your Trending topics are determined hasn’t changed, and as always, only public posts and posts that you are in the audience for (like updates from friends or groups that you belong to) will be shown in Trending.

Today, we’re introducing a new Facebook Groups app that helps people share faster and more easily with all the groups in their life. We built this app with the people who use Groups the most in mind, like: Students from Donda’s House, an arts nonprofit in Chicago, who use groups to stay in touch during and after a 12-week music program A class of dental students in Brazil who use a group to post notes and reminders about upcoming tests and due dates Nine best friends spread out across Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and England who use a group to keep connected Here’s how it works: When you open the app, you’ll see all your Facebook Groups in one place. Groups you use most frequently are at the top, and you can quickly move between each group. Easily start a new group by tapping Create. You can also track notifications and easily control which notifications you want to see. In the new Discover tab, you’ll see groups suggested to you based on Pages you’ve liked, groups your friends are in and where you live.

Our goal with News Feed has always been to show people the things they want to see. That’s why we often look to people on Facebook to tell us how we can improve. As part of an ongoing survey we asked hundreds of thousands of people how they feel about the content in their News Feeds. People told us they wanted to see more stories from friends and Pages they care about, and less promotional content. We dug further into the data to better understand this feedback. What we discovered is that a lot of the content people see as too promotional is posts from Pages they like, rather than ads. This may seem counterintuitive but it actually makes sense: News Feed has controls for the number of ads a person sees and for the quality of those ads (based on engagement, hiding ads, etc.), but those same controls haven’t been as closely monitored for promotional Page posts. Now we’re bringing new volume and content controls for promotional posts, so people see more of what they want from Pages. According to people we surveyed, there are some consistent traits that make organic posts feel too promotional: Posts that solely push people to buy a product or install an app Posts that push people to enter promotions and sweepstakes with no real context Posts that reuse the exact same content from ads Examples of these types of Page posts: Fewer Promotional Page Posts Beginning in January 2015, people will see less of this type of content in their News Feeds. As we’ve said before, News Feed is already a competitive place – as more people and Pages are posting content, competition to appear in News Feed has increased. All of this means that Pages that post promotional creative should expect their organic distribution to fall significantly over time. This change will not increase the number of ads people see in their News Feeds. The idea is to increase the relevance and quality of the overall stories – including Page posts – people see in their News Feeds. This change is about giving people the best Facebook experience possible and being responsive to what they have told us. While Pages that post a lot of the content we mention above will see a significant decrease in distribution, the majority of Pages will not be impacted by this change. For further guidance, we recommend that Pages refer to our Facebook for Business post here."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/11/introducing-say-thanks/","date":"2014-11-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Say Thanks","text":"By Cameron Ewing, Design Manager and Nick Kwiatek, Engineering Manager Millions of people use Facebook every day to connect with the people and things that matter to them most.

The size and diversity of the platform offers a town square-like atmosphere where people gather to voice opinions, interact with other voters and easily engage with the leaders who make the decisions that affect their lives every day. Today, people in the US on Facebook who are over 18 will see a message at the top of their News Feed reminding them that it’s Election Day and encouraging them to share with their friends that they’ve voted. People can also click “More Information” to find their nearest polling place. This poll finder is powered by Gettothepolls.com, a joint effort of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Voter Information Project and the Internet Association. This is the fourth US Election Day megaphone – it was previously available for the 2008, 2010 and 2012 elections – and for the first time, it will be available in multiple languages including Spanish, Chinese and Korean. Which language the user sees will depend on the language preferences they have set on Facebook and their device. 2014 also marks the first year the megaphone was deployed for elections in countries outside the US, including India, Brazil and Indonesia. We believe encouraging civic participation is an important contribution Facebook can make to the community, and the “I’m a Voter” message is designed to encourage people who are eligible to vote to turn out. In fact, a study in the journal Nature found that the megaphone has a real social multiplier effect and that in 2010, 340,000 additional people turned out at the polls after they saw on Facebook that friends had voted. After clicking the “I’m a Voter” button today, people will also be able to visit a real-time heat map that shows where people on Facebook are voting throughout the country. This map represents people who shared with their friends on Facebook that they’re voting in the 2014 US election. The information displayed here has been aggregated, and personal information, like names, have been removed. The shade of the map corresponds to the total amount of people who have shared that they’re voting, while the size of each burst represents sharing activity right now."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/10/improvements-to-photo-posts-on-mobile/","date":"2014-10-26T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Improvements to Photo Posts on Mobile","text":"By Thai Tran, Product Manager Today, we’re making it easier to quickly share multiple photos on mobile.

It is in these moments that communication is most critical both for people in the affected areas and for their friends and families anxious for news. We want to provide a helpful tool that people can use when major disasters strike, so we’ve created Safety Check – a simple and easy way to say you’re safe and check on others. During a major disaster, Safety Check will help you: Let friends and family know you’re safe Check on others in the affected area Mark your friends as safe Only your friends will see your safety status and the comments you share. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan was devastating. According to the Japanese Red Cross, more than 12.5 million people were affected nationwide, and more than 400,000 people were evacuated. During that crisis we saw how people used technology and social media to stay connected with those they cared about. Our engineers in Japan took the first step toward creating a product to improve the experience of reconnecting after a disaster. They built the Disaster Message Board to make it easier to communicate with others. They launched a test of the tool a year later and the response was overwhelming. Unfortunately, these kinds of disasters happen all too frequently. Each time, we see people, relief organizations and first responders turn to Facebook in the aftermath of a major natural disaster. These events have taught us a lot about how people use Facebook during disasters and we were personally inspired to continue work on the Disaster Message Board to incorporate what we’ve learned. This project soon became Safety Check, which will be available globally on Android, iOS, feature phones and desktop. The team set out to create a simple and easy-to-use tool that allows people to connect with their network of friends and family when it matters most. Here’s how it works: When the tool is activated after a natural disaster and if you’re in the affected area, you’ll receive a Facebook notification asking if you’re safe. We’ll determine your location by looking at the city you have listed in your profile, your last location if you’ve opted in to the Nearby Friends product, and the city where you are using the internet. If we get your location wrong, you can mark that you’re outside the affected area. If you’re safe, you can select “I’m Safe” and a notification and News Feed story will be generated with your update. Your friends can also mark you as safe. If you have friends in the area of a natural disaster and the tool has been activated, you will receive a notification about those friends that have marked themselves as safe. Clicking on this notification will take you to the Safety Check bookmark that will show you a list of their updates. If you’re ever in a situation that would require you to use Safety Check, we hope it’s a tool that helps you stay connected to those you care about, and gives you the comfort of knowing your loved ones are safe. Update as of 11/19/15 We created Safety Check to help in times of crisis and activated it eight times between October 2014 and November 2015 after natural disasters including the recent earthquakes in Nepal. The Paris attacks in November 2015 was the first time we activated the tool for a crisis other than a natural disaster. Read more from our Vice President of Growth Alex Schultz about why we made that decision and how it impacts our approach to Safety Check going forward. Update as of 11/17/2016 Initially, Facebook decided when Safety Check was activated, but our goal has always been to make it more useful for people for more types of incidents. We believe people closest to a disaster should play a bigger role in deciding when Safety Check is most helpful. As of November 2016, Safety Check will be turned on by our community instead of Facebook. How this works is that once an incident occurs, a third party source alerts Facebook. As part of that process the incident is automatically titled in line with the third party alert. If a lot of people in the area are talking about the incident, they may be invited to mark themselves safe, and invite others to do the same, through Safety Check."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/09/the-most-popular-honeymoon-destinations-in-2014/","date":"2014-09-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Trends"],"title":"The Most Popular Honeymoon Destinations in 2014","text":"What were the most popular places for newlyweds to spend their honeymoon in 2014?

We’ve heard feedback that there are some instances where a post from a friend or a Page you are connected to is only interesting at a specific moment, for example when you are both watching the same sports game, or talking about the season premiere of a popular TV show. There are also times when a post that is a day or two old may not be relevant to you anymore. Our latest update to News Feed ranking looks at two new factors to determine if a story is more important in the moment than other types of updates. Factoring in trending topics One way we show timely content higher-up in News Feed is to show people stories about things that are trending as soon as they occur, so you can immediately know what your friends or favorite Pages are saying about the stories of the day. This means that when a friend or Page you are connected to posts about something that is currently a hot topic of conversation on Facebook, that post is more likely to appear higher up in News Feed, so you can see it sooner. Early testing of a small percentage of posts has shown that this update on average leads to a more than 6% increase in people engaging with these stories (e.g., more people share, comment, like or click). Looking at when people like or comment The second update takes into account the rate at which people are liking or commenting on a post. Currently one of the signals we look at is the total number of likes that a post has received when determining how high up to to show it in News Feed. With this update, we are going to begin looking at when people are choosing to like, comment and share. If people are engaging with the post right after it is posted, and not as much a few hours later, this suggests that the post was most interesting at the time it was posted, but potentially less interesting at a later date. Based on this signal it is more likely to appear higher in News Feed earlier on and lower at a later date. We are also going to start taking this signal into account when considering which stories we bump in News Feed. Bumping is when we resurface stories that people did not scroll down far enough to see but are still getting lots of engagement. This is one more way that we’re working to identify timely posts so we can show them nearer the top of your News Feed sooner. Will this affect my Page? We will be rolling out these changes gradually and do not expect posts to see significant changes in distribution as a result of this update. If a Page posts about a trending topic or if a post sees a high velocity of engagement early on that then drops off, that post may begin to see increased distribution early on and less distribution over time. Pages should keep producing great content that is relevant and resonates with their audience."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/09/updates-to-facebook-for-ios-8/","date":"2014-09-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Facebook"],"title":"Updates to Facebook for iOS 8","text":"By Adam Mosseri, Product Management Director We’re excited for the launch of iOS 8, and we’re making updates to Facebook over the coming weeks to make it feel at home on your device. Designing Facebook for iOS 8 Facebook for iOS 8 will have an improved experience for people who want to share content from other apps to Facebook. By simply tapping the share icon and selecting Facebook, you can choose to share a link to a website from your browser, photos or videos from your camera roll, and content from other apps. Facebook for iOS 8 will have an updated share screen similar to what you already see in the Facebook app. From there, you can select the audience you want to share with, add a location, say what you’re doing, or tag friends. We’re also making sure that Facebook looks great on the new iPhone screens. We’re creating assets for the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ that take advantage of the new screen resolutions, making the experience bigger and clearer. We’re continuing to work to make sure all the features of our app work with the new OS. These updates will be available over the coming weeks. Location Settings Nothing has changed about how Facebook gets location information from devices, but Apple has updated its Location Services setting: With iOS 8, Apple has changed its Location Services setting. Before, there were only two choices for the kind of permission you could give an app: On or Off. Now, there are three choices: Always, While Using the App, or Never. When you update to iOS 8, if you previously used Facebook with Location Services set to “On,” you’ll notice that the location setting now starts out at “Always” (the new Apple setting option). Facebook isn’t getting any new location information when you upgrade to iOS 8: You control your location information. Nothing is changing and Facebook will continue to respect the choices you’ve made about location. As always, Facebook doesn’t get location information from your device unless you enable Location Services. Facebook does not get location information from your device in the background (that is, while you’re not using the app) unless you give us permission by turning on a feature that requires this, like Nearby Friends. Also, if you choose to turn on a feature like this, you’ll always be able to use your Facebook settings to control whether Facebook gets your location information in the background. For apps from Facebook that don’t have features that rely on getting location in the background, the Location Services setting for the iOS 8 versions will start at “While Using the App.” These apps include Messenger and Instagram. To learn more about how location works, visit our Help Center. We’ll continue to build out updates and new features for Facebook for iOS 8 over the coming weeks."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/09/introducing-facebook-media/","date":"2014-09-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Facebook Media","text":"Today we’re introducing Facebook Media – a site highlighting great examples and new trends that illustrate how public figures, organizations and media companies are using Facebook to connect with their audiences.

Whether capturing breaking news, a baby’s first steps, or rising to a friend’s challenge for charity, it is a remarkable storytelling medium. Video uploaded directly to Facebook is an increasingly important part of News Feed, and more people than ever before are sharing, discovering, and engaging with videos that they care about. Growth in video views exceeded 50% from May through July of this year, and since June there has been an average of more than 1 billion video views on Facebook every day. Video on Facebook was built to be mobile first, and now more than 65% of video views are on mobile. And we’re just getting started. Over the past year we’ve made several improvements to make it easier for people to discover and share great videos on Facebook. And with an update that will start rolling out this week, people will be able to see how many views a video on Facebook has received. Views will be shown on public videos from people and Pages, to help people discover new, popular videos. Last year, videos started coming to life with auto-play as people scrolled through their News Feed. This update rolled out slowly so we could listen to feedback and make tweaks. Today, people in the US and many countries around the world see videos auto-play in their News Feed. Auto-play settings are easily customizable on both mobile and web. Video ranking in News Feed was improved in June, to show people more videos that are relevant and interesting to them. Another feature that’s currently testing on mobile aims to help people discover new videos: now, when someone finishes watching a video, we may show additional related videos that they might find interesting. Publishers and public figures are also creating and sharing more great video content on Facebook, from on-the-ground reporting from media organizations to exclusive releases and behind-the-scenes videos from public figures. Publishers now have more detailed metrics and better tools to help them reach their audiences on Facebook. Call to action is one such tool, allowing content creators to invite people to visit a destination, such as a website, after the video ends to learn more, watch more or make a purchase. The goal of News Feed is to deliver the right stories to the right people at the right time, from the people and things you care about. And more people than ever before are seeing, sharing and expressing themselves with video on Facebook. We’re committed to making Facebook the best place to share, discover and watch videos, and we’ll keep listening to feedback to improve video on Facebook."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/09/2014-nfl-on-facebook/","date":"2014-09-04T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Trends"],"title":"2014 NFL Season Kicks Off on Facebook","text":"The 2014 NFL season is here, and the Facebook data team is taking a look at fandom for all 32 teams, along with the total interactions and top social moments from Thursday night’s opener.

We’re making two updates, the first to reduce click-baiting headlines, and the second to help people see links shared on Facebook in the best format. Click-Baiting Headlines “Click-baiting” is when a publisher posts a link with a headline that encourages people to click to see more, without telling them much information about what they will see. Posts like these tend to get a lot of clicks, which means that these posts get shown to more people, and get shown higher up in News Feed. However, when we asked people in an initial survey what type of content they preferred to see in their News Feeds, 80% of the time people preferred headlines that helped them decide if they wanted to read the full article before they had to click through. Over time, stories with “click-bait” headlines can drown out content from friends and Pages that people really care about. So how do we determine what looks like click-bait? One way is to look at how long people spend reading an article away from Facebook. If people click on an article and spend time reading it, it suggests they clicked through to something valuable. If they click through to a link and then come straight back to Facebook, it suggests that they didn’t find something that they wanted. With this update we will start taking into account whether people tend to spend time away from Facebook after clicking a link, or whether they tend to come straight back to News Feed when we rank stories with links in them. Another factor we will use to try and show fewer of these types of stories is to look at the ratio of people clicking on the content compared to people discussing and sharing it with their friends. If a lot of people click on the link, but relatively few people click Like, or comment on the story when they return to Facebook, this also suggests that people didn’t click through to something that was valuable to them. Sharing links in posts Our second update relates to sharing links in posts. When people share a link on Facebook it often appears in News Feed with a large picture, a headline and some text that gives context on the link: Sometimes publishers share links in status updates or in the text caption above photos: We’ve found that people often prefer to click on links that are displayed in the link format (which appears when you paste a link while drafting a post), rather than links that are buried in photo captions. The link format shows some additional information associated with the link, such as the beginning of the article, which makes it easier for someone to decide if they want to click through. This format also makes it easier for someone to click through on mobile devices, which have a smaller screen. With this update, we will prioritize showing links in the link-format, and show fewer links shared in captions or status updates. The best way to share a link after these updates will be to use the link format. In our studies, these posts have received twice as many clicks compared to links embedded in photo captions. In general, we recommend that you use the story type that best fits the message that you want to tell – whether that’s a status, photo, link or video. Will this affect my Page? A small set of publishers who are frequently posting links with click-bait headlines that many people don’t spend time reading after they click through may see their distribution decrease in the next few months. We’re making these changes to ensure that click-bait content does not drown out the things that people really want to see on Facebook."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/08/the-ice-bucket-challenge-on-facebook/","date":"2014-08-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Strengthening Communities","Trends"],"title":"The Ice Bucket Challenge on Facebook","text":"Update on 9/7/14: Between June 1 – September 1, more than 17 million videos related to the ice bucket challenge were shared to Facebook.

For the greatest number of characters in expression of the word “goal” on Facebook, Venezuela would top the list with an average of 21 characters.

We’re adding that to the factors we considered previously, which included likes, comments and shares. This change will affect all videos uploaded directly to Facebook. This also helps us personalize News Feed based on people’s preference for watching video. People who tend to watch more video in News Feed should expect to see more videos near the top of their Feed. Conversely, people who tend to skip over videos without watching them should expect to see fewer videos. In our early tests, this improvement resulted in more people watching more videos that are relevant to them. Impact on Video Links on Facebook This change only applies to videos uploaded to Facebook directly by individuals and Pages. For links to other sites, including video sites, we already use a number of similar metrics to rank those stories. Recommendations for Pages sharing Video This improvement means that videos that people choose to watch will reach a larger audience, while videos that people ignore will be shown to fewer people. As always, we recommend that Page owners post stories and videos that will resonate with their audience on Facebook. Use the new video metrics section in Page Insights to help understand which videos your audience is watching."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/06/adding-new-games-and-trending-sidebar-on-ipad/","date":"2014-06-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Adding New Games and Trending Sidebar on iPad","text":"In the latest update to Facebook for iPad in the US, we’re testing new ways to help people discover more timely and entertaining content.

In recognition of all the fathers out there, and those who will be celebrating them, we have put together some interesting dad-related content from Facebook including: Facebook data showing some interesting shared interests between fathers and their children In spirit of the World Cup, an analysis of how a certain World Cup player influenced the naming of newborns during and after the 1986 World Cup An inspiring story of one young woman’s reconnection with her father on Facebook Shared Interests Between Fathers and Their Children While fathers and their kids may feel like there is little overlap between their favorite musicians, athletes and movies, we took a look at Likes on Facebook and found that they may have more in common than they thought. This analysis of mutual Likes among self-identified fathers and their children on Facebook as compared with Likes among all people who use Facebook reveals what their shared interests look like across music, athletes, entertainment and more. Only children who are over age 18 in likely father-child relationships were considered.

One player, Diego Maradona, remains relevant in soccer history and interestingly, in the names of many young men who were born during and after the historic matches he played in nearly 30 years ago, according to an analysis by the Facebook Data Science team. Towards the end of the World Cup in 1986, there was a 260% increase of babies named Diego in Argentina, and 1 out of 3 Diegos born in Brazil between June 1986 and 1987 were named after Maradona.

While some people want to post to everyone, others have told us that they are more comfortable sharing with a smaller group, like just their friends. We recognize that it is much worse for someone to accidentally share with everyone when they actually meant to share just with friends, compared with the reverse. So, going forward, when new people join Facebook, the default audience of their first post will be set to Friends. Previously, for most people, it was set to Public. First time posters will also see a reminder to choose an audience for their first post, and if they don’t make a choice, it will be set to Friends. People can change who they are posting to at any time, and can also change the privacy of their past posts too. For people already on Facebook, we’ve also received the feedback that they are sometimes worried about sharing something by accident, or sharing with the wrong audience. Over the next few weeks, we’ll start rolling out a new and expanded privacy checkup tool, which will take people through a few steps to review things like who they’re posting to, which apps they use, and the privacy of key pieces of information on their profile. We want to do all we can to put power and control in people’s hands. This new tool is designed to help people make sure they are sharing with just the audience they want. Everything about how privacy works on Facebook remains the same. Additional Controls Over the past several months, we’ve introduced new tools and features to help people control exactly what they want to share and with whom: Public posting reminder: a quick reminder to people posting publicly to make sure they are sharing with the audience they want. Simplified Audience Selectors: On Facebook for iPhone, the audience you’re sharing a post with is now at the top of the screen, and on web, people will see a simplified audience selector. We’re testing and rolling out similar improvements in other places people use Facebook. Anonymous Login and New Controls for Facebook Login: Anonymous Login is a brand new way to log into apps without sharing any personal information from Facebook. The new Facebook Login gives people the option to pick and choose what information apps get. Redesigned App Control Panel: A new dashboard where people can see a list of apps they use, manage specific permissions, or remove apps entirely.

Or you’ve seen your friend check in at a coffee shop “drinking an iced coffee.” In the last year, people shared more than 5 billion status updates that included these kinds of feelings and activities, sparking conversations with friends in a more visual way. Today, we’re making those conversations quicker and easier by introducing a new way to share and discover music, TV and movies. When writing a status update – if you choose to turn the feature on – you’ll have the option to use your phone’s microphone to identify what song is playing or what show or movie is on TV. That means if you want to share that you’re listening to your favorite Beyoncé track or watching the season premiere of Game of Thrones, you can do it quickly and easily, without typing. Here’s how it works: If you’ve turned the feature on, you’ll see an audio icon moving on the screen when you write a status update. If the feature finds a match, you can then choose to add the song, TV show or movie to your post. Like with any post, you choose who can see it. You can also turn the feature off at any time by clicking the audio icon in the top right of the screen. If you leave the feature on, you will see the audio icon move and attempt to detect a match when you’re writing a status update. No sound is stored and you’ll always get to choose whether you post to your friends. If you share music, your friends can see a 30-second preview of the song. For TV shows, the story in News Feed will highlight the specific season and episode you’re watching, so you can avoid any spoilers and join in conversations with your friends after you’ve caught up. This feature will be available on Android and iOS in the US in the coming weeks. To learn more, visit our Help Center. Update as of 5/28: We’ve heard some questions recently based on a few misunderstandings about how this product works. We want to clear them up. Myth: People have to use this new feature. Fact: Nope, this feature is completely optional. If you don’t turn it on, we won’t use your microphone to try and match TV or music when you write a status update. If you do choose to turn it on and later decide it’s not for you, you can easily turn it off at any time. Myth: The feature listens to and stores your conversations. Fact: Nope, no matter how interesting your conversation, this feature does not store sound or recordings. Facebook isn’t listening to or storing your conversations. Here’s how it works: if you choose to turn the feature on, when you write a status update, the app converts any sound into an audio fingerprint on your phone. This fingerprint is sent to our servers to try and match it against our database of audio and TV fingerprints. By design, we do not store fingerprints from your device for any amount of time. And in any event, the fingerprints can’t be reversed into the original audio because they don’t contain enough information. Myth: Facebook is always listening using your microphone. Fact: Nope, if you choose to turn this feature on, it will only use your microphone (for 15 seconds) when you’re actually writing a status update to try and match music and TV. Myth: Facebook is automatically posting what you’re listening to. Fact: We do not automatically post anything about what you’re listening to. If you’ve chosen to use this feature, and we find a match, you choose whether you want to include the TV show or song in your status update. Myth: Facebook is storing the information from this feature indefinitely. Fact: If you’ve chosen to use this feature and we find a match, you get to choose whether you post that you’re listening to a particular song or TV show. That post will then appear on Facebook for as long as you choose and to whatever audience you choose, just like any other update. If we find a match and you don’t post, we log that a particular song or TV show was matched, but we don’t connect this with your profile in any way. We use this to keep a chart of the most watched and listened to songs and TV shows. If we don’t find a match, we log that we failed. We don’t store the fingerprint."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/05/facebook-weekly-highlights-37/","date":"2014-05-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Trends"],"title":"Facebook Weekly Highlights","text":"Gearing up for World Cup and Barbara Walters’ retirement are among the most-buzzed-about topics on Facebook this week.

Nearby Friends helps you discover which friends are nearby or on the go. If you turn on Nearby Friends, you’ll occasionally be notified when friends are nearby, so you can get in touch with them and meet up. For example, when you’re headed to the movies, Nearby Friends will let you know if friends are nearby so you can see the movie together or meet up afterward. Nearby Friends is an optional feature. You can choose who can see if you’re nearby (for example: your friends, close friends, or a specific friends list) and you can turn it on and off at any time. Sharing your location with Nearby Friends goes two ways — you and your friends both have to turn on Nearby Friends and choose to share with each other to see when you’re nearby. Your friends will only be able to see that you’re nearby if you share this info with them and vice versa.

Today we are announcing a series of improvements to News Feed to reduce stories that people frequently tell us are spammy and that they don’t want to see. Many of these stories are published by Pages that deliberately try and game News Feed to get more distribution than they normally would. Our update targets three broad categories of this type of feed spam behavior. Like-baiting “Like-baiting” is when a post explicitly asks News Feed readers to like, comment or share the post in order to get additional distribution beyond what the post would normally receive. People often respond to posts asking them to take an action, and this means that these posts get shown to more people, and get shown higher up in News Feed. However, when we survey people and ask them to rate the quality of these stories, they report that like-baiting stories are, on average, 15% less relevant than other stories with a comparable number of likes, comments and shares. Over time, these stories lead to a less enjoyable experience of Facebook since they drown out content from friends and Pages that people really care about. The improvement we are making today better detects these stories and helps ensure that they are not shown more prominently in News Feed than more relevant stories from friends and other Pages. This update will not impact Pages that are genuinely trying to encourage discussion among their fans, and focuses initially on Pages that frequently post explicitly asking for Likes, Comments and Shares. Frequently Circulated Content People and Pages on Facebook frequently reshare great content, but people tell us there are occasionally instances where photos or videos are uploaded to Facebook over and over again. We’ve found that people tend to find these instances of repeated content less relevant, and are more likely to complain about the Pages that frequently post them. We are improving News Feed to de-emphasize these Pages, and our early testing shows that this change causes people to hide 10% fewer stories from Pages overall. Spammy Links Some stories in News Feed use inaccurate language or formatting to try and trick people into clicking through to a website that contains only ads or a combination of frequently circulated content and ads. For instance, often these stories claim to link to a photo album but instead take the viewer to a website with just ads. By measuring how frequently people on Facebook who visit a link choose to like the original post or share that post with their friends, we’ve been able to better detect spammy links. The update we are making today improves News Feed to reduce cases of these spammy links, and in our early testing we’ve seen a 5% increase in people on Facebook clicking on links that take them off of Facebook – this is a big increase in the context of News Feed and is a good sign that people are finding the remaining content in their News Feed more relevant and trustworthy. Will this affect my Page? The vast majority of publishers on Facebook are not posting feed spam so they should not be negatively impacted by these changes, and, if anything, may see a very small increase in News Feed distribution. A smaller set of publishers who are frequently and intentionally creating feed spam will see their distribution decrease over the next few months. We’re making these changes to ensure that feed spam content does not drown out the content that people really want to see on Facebook from the friends and Pages they care about."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/04/2014-ncaa-tournament-on-facebook/","date":"2014-04-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Trends"],"title":"2014 NCAA Tournament on Facebook","text":"The Connecticut Huskies won the NCAA men’s basketball championship game on Monday night, defeating the Kentucky Wildcats 60-54 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. It was a contest that featured the highest combined seeds in the history of the national title game. The matchup pitting No. 7 UConn against No. 8 Kentucky ended with the Huskies winning a fourth NCAA title, the team’s second championship in four seasons. Sports is inherently social – we are never fans alone – and Facebook was the place where millions of college basketball fans joined the conversation around this year’s NCAA tournament. From early buzz and bracket building after Selection Sunday, through the Final Four and championship games, more than 15.3 million people on Facebook in the US had 46 million combined posts, comments and “Likes” (March 16 – April 7, 2014). UConn’s Shabazz Napier scored a game-high 22 points during the final to lead the Huskies. The senior guard, who was on the 2011 national championship team, was named Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Teammate Ryan Boatright added 14 points. Napier and Boatright were the most-mentioned players on Facebook during Monday night’s game. Kentucky guard James Young racked up 20 points for the Wildcats, and his slam dunk was among the top social moments on Facebook. The play that gave Kentucky a much-needed spark in the second half was topped only by tipoff, according to Facebook buzz. Connecticut’s strong performance and victory rounded out the Top 5 spikes in conversation: Top Social Moments on Facebook: Tipoff Dunk by James Young gives Kentucky spark in second half UConn leads at halftime, 35-31 UConn wins the National Championship UConn starts off strong up to the first timeout LeBron James wasn’t the only NBA star chiming in on Facebook. Houston Rockets’ Dwight Howard helped console a friend, while Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder congratulated UConn Coach Kevin Ollie. Other public figures, such as professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, also joined the conversation. Tuesday morning, Kentucky coach John Calipari expressed his profound disappointment over his team’s loss. Road to the Final Four Buzz was building steadily on Facebook throughout the early rounds of the tournament. As the field narrowed to the regional semifinals, or Sweet 16, Facebook’s data team looked at which teams were top talkers at the state level across the nation. Mapping out the buzz produced a swath of red from coast to coast, as bubble team Dayton (No. 11 seed) dominated the conversation. Dayton would advance to the Elite 8 round before losing to top-seeded Florida. Facebook’s “Social Bracket” After the NCAA selection committee announced the field of 68 teams on Sunday, March 16, we wondered how “bracketology” would play out if teams advanced based on Facebook buzz. Facebook’s “Social Bracket” was tracking fairly well into the regional semifinals, picking 11 of the teams in the Sweet 16. By the Elite 8 round, only three of the most-mentioned teams remained. Florida was the only Facebook pick to make it into the Final Four.

Today, we’re adding a new way for people to discover conversations around topics they’ve expressed interest in. Now, when a Page tags another Page, we may show the post to some of the people who like or follow the tagged Page. For example, this post by the Bleacher Report might be shown in News Feed to people who follow or like Dwight Howard, in addition to people who follow or like the Bleacher Report. This already happens with updates from friends — if a friend tags me in a photo, my friends may see this photo in their News Feed even if they’re not friends with the person who tagged me. When we tested adding this feature for Pages we found that people liked seeing this type of content in their News Feeds and gave these stories high scores in surveys. We look at many factors to make sure the most relevant stories appear in News Feed, including which posts are getting the most engagement (such as likes, comments, shares and clicks) across all of Facebook. We also consider which posts are getting the most engagement from people who like both the Page that posted and the Page that was tagged. For example, if many people who like Dwight Howard also like the Bleacher Report, it suggests that these two Pages are connected. If we see that people who like both the Bleacher Report and Dwight Howard are liking the post above, that’s an indication that it may be relevant for people who only like Dwight Howard. This means some Page posts that tag other Pages may be seen by new people."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/02/internet-org-announces-socialedu/","date":"2014-02-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Facebook","Internet.org","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Internet.org Announces SocialEDU","text":"Today, we’re excited to introduce SocialEDU, a pilot initiative that will provide students in Rwanda with free access to a collaborative online education experience. How did we do this? By bringing together the right partners. We worked with the Rwandan government, a telecom company, a device manufacturer and an educational content provider to develop a plan to provide students with free, high-quality, localized educational content and create a social learning experience that is accessible via handheld devices. The initiative builds on the success of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) by making it possible to access high-quality educational content affordably. “Internet.org is about working together to remove barriers to access and give billions of people the power to connect to the knowledge economy,” said Javier Olivan, Vice President of Growth and Analytics at Facebook. “SocialEDU represents this kind of collaboration at its best.” At its core, SocialEDU addresses five critical barriers to access by bringing together: Free content Free data Affordable smartphones Localized, social educational experience A government that supports innovation In this program, edX (edx.org) will work with Facebook to create a social educational experience by building a mobile app that is integrated with Facebook. Airtel will provide free education data for everyone in Rwanda who participates in the program for one year, while Nokia will pitch in with affordable smartphones that will improve the quality and ease of Internet access. To bring device prices down further, the Government of Rwanda will support innovative financing mechanisms, such as interest rate subsidies, micro-loan guarantees, trade-in rebates, and targeted use of its Universal Service Fund. The Government will also expand its Smart Kigali program to provide free wi-fi in campuses throughout the country, enabling students to access high-quality multimedia educational content. Furthermore, the Government will work with edX to adapt course materials for local students. Airtel will lead operations for the phone trade-in program. Normally these types of apps consume a great deal of bandwidth to work properly. To ensure the success of the app in Rwanda, Facebook is providing engineering support to guarantee that the app creates a social experience that is optimized for a low-bandwidth environment. Facebook will work closely with Ericsson to test the app’s functionality at Ericsson’s facility, which simulates a 2G environment to provide developers with immediate feedback on the app’s performance in alternative environments. Later this year, Facebook, in partnership with Ericsson, will launch a unique testing facility that simulates alternative environments for developers to use when creating apps for similar markets. Airtel Africa’s CEO Christian de Faria said, “We are honored to participate in this noble initiative. Education is one of the key engines for economic and social growth across the continent, with Rwanda amongst Africa’s most respected countries for its outstanding development record. We will do everything possible to support this ongoing reform using Airtel’s technological capability in the data and mobile commerce environment, to facilitate Rwanda’s rapid progress.” Nokia’s Executive Vice President for Mobile Phones, Timo Toikkanen said, “Our affordable smartphones help people make the transition from simple mobility to more sophisticated experiences. Playing a role in helping students get access to these experiences, such as social education, through the SocialEDU initiative is truly an honor.” Rwanda’s Minister of Youth and ICT, Jean Philbert Nsengimana said, “The Government of Rwanda is excited to partner with Facebook to open up a world full of content and interaction to Rwandan students. The social education experience will accelerate innovation and propel Rwanda into a knowledge-based economy. We are committed to doing our part to make sure SocialEDU has the greatest possible impact in Rwanda. This is fully aligned with the Government’s Broadband for All policy and the Smart Kigali Initiative, a public-private partnership that provides free wi-fi in Kigali’s most popular squares, buses, hotels, and public buildings.” “Improving global access to high-quality education has been a key edX goal from day one,” said Anant Agarwal, president of edX. “Nearly half of our 2 million students come from developing countries, with 10 percent from Africa. In partnering with Facebook on this innovative pilot, we hope to learn how we can take this concept to the world.” With SocialEDU, students in Rwanda will receive free data plans for accessing free edX MOOCs from some of the world’s leading universities, including Harvard, MIT, U.C. Berkeley, TU Delft, Australian National University and ETH Zurich. Our platform will allow students to ask questions, engage with other students, interact with teachers, and participate in group discussions. We are bringing the classroom to them and providing locally-relevant content, while transforming the educational experience to provide collaborative, social and sustainable learning. We know we have a long way to go to provide access to the two-thirds of the world that doesn’t have it today. Rwanda is our first test of this approach, and our hope is that this will serve as a blueprint for other partnerships to follow. Through committed partnerships like SocialEDU, we move one step closer to bringing everyone in the global community online.

Some of the people who reach out to us are grieving the death of a friend or family member, and they usually ask for their loved one’s timeline to be memorialized. Over the past several months, we’ve been thinking about and working on better ways for people to remember loved ones. As we continue to think through each aspect of memorialization, we ask ourselves questions that have no easy answers: How might people feel? Are we honoring the wishes and legacy of the person who passed away? Are we serving people who are grieving the loss of a loved one as best we can? Based on conversations inspired by these questions, we’ve decided to make an important change to how we preserve legacies on Facebook. Up to now, when a person’s account was memorialized, we restricted its visibility to friends-only. This meant that people could no longer see the account or any of its content unless they were Facebook friends with the person who passed away. Starting today, we will maintain the visibility of a person’s content as-is. This will allow people to see memorialized profiles in a manner consistent with the deceased person’s expectations of privacy. We are respecting the choices a person made in life while giving their extended community of family and friends ongoing visibility to the same content they could always see. Today, we’re also glad to begin offering a way for anyone who has suffered the loss of a loved one to see that person’s “Look Back” video. In recognition of our ten-year anniversary, a group of our engineers created personal movies for people using some of the posts and photos they had shared over the years. For one man in Missouri, the Look Back video he was most desperate to watch was one that had not yet been made. John Berlin reached out to ask if it was possible for Facebook to create a video for his son, Jesse, who passed away in 2012. We had not initially made the videos for memorialized accounts, but John’s request touched the hearts of everyone who heard it, including ours. Since then, many others have asked us to share the Look Back videos of their loved ones, too, and we’re now glad to be able to fulfill those requests (video requests can be made here). Changes like this are part of a larger, ongoing effort to help people when they face difficult challenges like bereavement on Facebook.

This Valentine’s Day, the Facebook Data Science team is showing their love for data through a series of relationship-related posts. Here’s a collection of original research on the nature of relationships and other Valentine’s Day topics that the team has explored this week. Love and Religion A look at people in relationships on Facebook who have listed their religion, revealing that interfaith relationships are rare in most countries, especially among married couples and older people. The Age of Love An exploration of age differences between people in relationships around the world, finding that among opposite-sex couples, males are consistently 2-5 years older than females, and these differences are higher for same-sex couples. Looking for Love The team identified the best cities for single people measured along three dimensions: percentage of single people, probability of relationship formation, and single female-to-male ratio. The top five cities (among the top 50 population centers) by percentage of single people are: 1. Detroit, MI 2. Los Angeles, CA 3. New York, NY 4. Miami, FL 5. Memphis, TN The top five cities in terms of largest probability of relationship formation for a single person: 1. Colorado Springs, CO 2. El Paso, TX 3. Louisville, KY 4. Fort Worth, TX 5. San Antonio, TX This chart shows an inverse correlation between percentage of singles in these cities and relationship formation. Most single females per single male: 1. Memphis, TN 2. Jacksonville, FL 3. Fort Worth, TX 4. Charlotte, NC 5. Richmond, VA Most single males per single female: 1. San Francisco, CA 2. San Jose, CA 3. Seattle, WA 4. Salt Lake City, UT 5. San Diego, CA We considered only people on Facebook in the US age 21+ and sourced anonymized, aggregated data over a one month time frame for Looking for Love. Probability of relationship formation is the likelihood a single person will enter a relationship in a city based on the number of people who have changed their relationship status from single to in a relationship during the month. Data used in all posts is anonymized and aggregated. Stay tuned for more to come on the Data Science [https://www.facebook.com/data] Page on Valentine’s Day and the day after.

We are never fans alone. This year’s Super Bowl matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos saw millions of us connecting in real-time on Facebook, the go-to place for NFL fans to cheer their favorite team on to victory and collectively lick their wounds after a defeat. The Seahawks beat the Broncos in a 43-8 win. More than 50 million unique people joined the conversation on Facebook to chat about the game. Our data editors tallied the posts, comments and “likes” related to Super Bowl chatter, and reported a total of approximately 185 million interactions. Several moments throughout the game accounted for big spikes in Facebook chatter, like when Seattle’s Percy Harvin ran away with the ball at the top of the second half. In fact, the Seahawks dominated the top four out of five most-buzzed-about moments, with Denver’s first and only touchdown squeezing into the fifth spot.

This first one is based on “Likes” to Official Team Pages for the Seahawks and the Broncos. We released this ahead of time to show where loyalties lie leading up the game, and it appeared that the Seahawks did not have much love outside the Pacific Northwest.

We regularly run tests to work out how to make the experience better. Through testing, we have found that when people see more text status updates on Facebook they write more status updates themselves. In fact, in our initial test when we showed more status updates from friends it led to on average 9 million more status updates written each day. Because of this, we showed people more text status updates in their News Feed. Over time, we noticed that this effect wasn’t true for text status updates from Pages. As a result, the latest update to News Feed ranking treats text status updates from Pages as a different category to text status updates from friends. We are learning that posts from Pages behave differently to posts from friends and we are working to improve our ranking algorithms so that we do a better job of differentiating between the two types. This will help us show people more content they want to see. Page admins can expect a decrease in the distribution of their text status updates, but they may see some increases in engagement and distribution for other story types. Many Page owners often ask what kind of content they should post. This is difficult to answer, as it depends on who your audience is and what they want to see. Still, one thing we’ve observed is that when some Pages share links on Facebook, they do so by embedding the link in the status update, like the one below: The best way to share a link after this update will be to use a link-share, so it looks like the one below. We’ve found that, as compared to sharing links by embedding in status updates, these posts get more engagement (more likes, comments, shares and clicks) and they provide a more visual and compelling experience for people seeing them in their feeds. In general, we recommend that you use the story type that best fits the message that you want to tell – whether that’s a status, photo, link or video. We’ll continue to work to improve News Feed, and keep you posted here."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2014/01/finding-popular-conversations-on-facebook/","date":"2014-01-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Finding Popular Conversations on Facebook","text":"By Chris Struhar, Engineering Manager Facebook is a space where people from all over the world gather every day to share their thoughts and participate in real-time conversations, from the highlights of the Golden Globes to the passing of Nelson Mandela.

We’re beginning to test a similar video viewing format for advertisers. Marketers will be able to use this new format to tell their stories to a large number of people on Facebook in a short amount of time – with high-quality sight, sound and motion. This approach will continue to improve the quality of ads that you see in News Feed. This week, a small number of people will see video ads for the new film ‘Divergent’ begin playing as they come into view in News Feed on mobile and desktop. Here’s how it will work: Rather than having to click or tap to play, videos will begin to play as they appear onscreen – without sound – similar to how they behave when shared by friends or verified Pages. If you don’t want to watch the video, you can simply scroll or swipe past it. If the video is clicked or tapped and played in full screen, the sound for that video will play as well. At the end of the video a carousel of two additional videos will appear, making it easy to continue to discover content from the same marketers. On mobile devices, all videos that begin playing as they appear on the screen will have been downloaded in advance when the device was connected to Wi-Fi – meaning this content will not consume data plans, even if you’re not connected to Wi-Fi at the time of playback. We’ll continue to refine this new way for brands to tell stories on Facebook to ensure the best experience for people and marketers.For more specifics on this feature for marketers, read our post on Facebook for Business. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Which videos start playing in News Feed? A: At this time, videos start playing from: 1. Individuals (personal Facebook accounts or verified Pages) 2. Some Pages, like those of entertainers and sports organizations 3. Summit Entertainment’s content for ‘Divergent’ Q: Is there a way to prevent these video ads from playing as they appear on screen? A: The video ads will begin to play as you scroll through News Feed, but if you don’t want to watch, you can simply keep scrolling and the video will stop playing. Video ads that start playing as they appear on screen within News Feed are pre-downloaded when you are on Wi-Fi so they do not consume additional data. Q: When do videos play with sound? A: Videos will not play with sound unless you turn the sound on. To do this, click or tap on the video. Q: When will all video content begin to play as it appears on screen? A: This is an initial, limited test. We will let you know if/when you’ll begin seeing more video content begin to play as it comes into view."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/12/donate-to-nonprofits-through-facebook/","date":"2013-12-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Donate to Nonprofits Through Facebook","text":"Today we’re starting to roll out a new feature called Donate that lets people contribute directly to nonprofits through Facebook. The Donate feature will appear beside Posts in News Feed shared by participating nonprofits and at the top of their Facebook Pages. When people click “Donate Now” they can choose the amount, enter their payment information, and immediately donate to that cause. They also have the option to share the nonprofit’s post with their friends. We hope this will help increase donations as people encourage their friends to donate to the causes that are important to them. In times of disaster or crisis, people turn to Facebook to check on loved ones, get updates, and to learn how they can help. In November 2013, in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, we partnered with the International Federation of Red Cross to let people donate directly to the Red Cross’s relief efforts in the Philippines. After seeing the generosity of people around the world toward this effort, we’ve been inspired to help everyone donate, at any time, to the organizations they care about most. Donate also gives nonprofits an easier way to reach out and ask for help, both to support their everyday mission and in the wake of major disasters. And, with a community of over one billion people on Facebook, every local cause can become a global one — and every global cause can become a personal movement. As we developed this feature, we partnered with a few nonprofits and will make it available to more organizations soon. Any nonprofit group that is interested in tapping into this new feature on Facebook can fill out the Donate interest form in the Facebook Help Center. Anyone who wants to make a donation to any of the following nonprofit organizations can visit their Facebook Page and start giving today.

Nelson Mandela While some of the people or topics featured on this year’s global list need no introduction, like Pope Francis, others prompted us to dig a little deeper. “Election” appeared in many languages, and was the second most mentioned term on Facebook worldwide in 2013. With high-profile national elections in countries like India, Kenya, Iran and Italy year, it’s not a surprise to see it near the top of our list. We also took the pulse of regional conversations in 16 different countries to give people a look at the most talked about topics near them. These lists are available on Facebook Stories at FacebookStories.com/2013. Methodology Top life events and check-ins: We looked at which life events and places generated the most posts and check-ins in 2013, and then used the data to create global and country-level rankings. Most talked about topics: We measured how many Facebook posts in 2013 mentioned a specific topic and then ranked those topics based on the overall number of mentions to create each list. Mentions include both the term itself and related hashtags. For example, both “Here at the #inauguration” and “Proud to be at the presidential inauguration” would be calculated as part of the buzz related to a single event.

In the last year, more people found news on Facebook than ever before. In fact, as reported in October, average referral traffic from Facebook to media sites has increased by over 170% – almost tripled – in the past year. Today’s update to News Feed ranking recognizes that people want to see more relevant news and what their friends have to say about it. More relevant articles in Feed People use Facebook to share and connect, including staying current on the latest news, whether it’s about their favorite celebrity or what’s happening in the world. We’ve noticed that people enjoy seeing articles on Facebook, and so we’re now paying closer attention to what makes for high quality content, and how often articles are clicked on from News Feed on mobile. What this means is that you may start to notice links to articles a little more often (particularly on mobile). Why are we doing this? Our surveys show that on average people prefer links to high quality articles about current events, their favorite sports team or shared interests, to the latest meme. Starting soon, we’ll be doing a better job of distinguishing between a high quality article on a website versus a meme photo hosted somewhere other than Facebook when people click on those stories on mobile. This means that high quality articles you or others read may show up a bit more prominently in your News Feed, and meme photos may show up a bit less prominently. To complement people’s interest in articles, we recently began looking at ways to show people additional articles similar to ones they had just read. Soon, after you click on a link to an article, you may see up to three related articles directly below the News Feed post to help you discover more content you may find interesting. Comment Stories While trying to show more articles people want to read, we also don’t want people to miss the conversations among their friends. So we’re updating bumping to highlight stories with new comments. After people read a story, they are unlikely to go back and find that story again to see what their friends were saying about it, and it wouldn’t bump up in News Feed. With this update stories will occasionally resurface that have new comments from friends. As a result, people may start seeing a few more stories returning to their feed with new comments highlighted. Our testing has shown that doing this in moderation for just a small number of stories can lead to more conversations between people and their friends on all types of content. We’ll continue to keep you posted on the updates we make in response to people’s feedback. Stay tuned for more."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/11/facebook-weekly-highlights-9/","date":"2013-11-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Trends"],"title":"Facebook Weekly Highlights","text":"NFL quarterback Tom Brady is feeling thankful in a personal video post. “Dancing with the Stars” finalists Jack Osbourne and Cheryl Burke share their excitement.

That can be a single person in a message, a small group, with friends, or with the world. Each time you share a status update, you choose the audience you want to share with. Unless you change it, the audience remains the same for future posts. Up until today, for people aged 13 through 17, the initial audience of their first post on Facebook was set to “Friends of Friends” – with the option to change it. Going forward, when people aged 13 through 17 sign up for an account on Facebook, the initial audience of their first post will be set to a narrower audience of “Friends.” A new option to share more broadly Teens are among the savviest people using social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard. So, starting today, people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on Facebook. While only a small fraction of teens using Facebook might choose to post publicly, this update now gives them the choice to share more broadly, just like on other social media services. In addition, teens will be able to turn on Follow so that their public posts can be seen in people’s News Feeds. As always, followers can only see posts they are in the audience for. These changes are designed to improve the experience for teens on Facebook. As part of this, we are also looking at ways to improve the way teens use messages and connect with people they may know. Inline Reminders and Education We take the safety of teens very seriously, so they will see an extra reminder before they can share publicly. When teens choose “Public” in the audience selector, they’ll see a reminder that the post can be seen by anyone, not just people they know, with an option to change the post’s privacy. And if they choose to continue posting publicly, they will get an additional reminder. Additional resources: To learn more about teens and privacy, visit the Help Center.

The search setting was removed last year for people who weren’t using it. For the small percentage of people still using the setting, they will see reminders about it being removed in the coming weeks. Whether you’ve been using the setting or not, the best way to control what people can find about you on Facebook is to choose who can see the individual things you share. What setting are you removing and why? Everyone used to have a setting called “Who can look up your Timeline by name?,” which controlled whether you could be found when people typed your name into the Facebook search bar. The setting was created when Facebook was a simple directory of profiles and it was very limited. For example, it didn’t prevent people from navigating to your Timeline by clicking your name in a story in News Feed, or from a mutual friend’s Timeline. Today, people can also search Facebook using Graph Search (for example, “People who live in Seattle,”) making it even more important to control the privacy of the things you share rather than how people get to your Timeline. The setting also made Facebook’s search feature feel broken at times. For example, people told us that they found it confusing when they tried looking for someone who they knew personally and couldn’t find them in search results, or when two people were in a Facebook Group and then couldn’t find each other through search. How will I know when the setting is being removed? If you still have the old setting, you will see a notice on your homepage like the one below. You can click to learn more, or close it to get a reminder later. How do I control what people can find about me? The best way to control what people can find about you is to choose the audience of the individual things you share. In the coming weeks, people who are sharing posts publicly on Facebook will also see a notice reminding them that those posts can be seen by anyone, including people they may not know. The notice reminds people how to change the audience for each post. To quickly control who can find posts you shared in the past, visit the privacy settings page. With one click, you can limit the audience of posts you’ve shared in the past. This means any posts that were previously shared with Friends of Friends or Public will now be shared just to Friends. To further control what people see across the site: 1. Share each post with the people you want to be able to see it. You control this every time you post. 2. Use Activity Log to review individual things you’ve already shared. Here you can delete things you may not want to appear on Facebook anymore, untag photos and change the privacy of past posts. 3. Ask friends and others to remove anything they may have shared about you that you don’t want on the site. You can do this by reaching out to the person directly, or using the reporting feature, also available in Activity Log. To get to Activity Log and other privacy tools, click at the top of every page to use your privacy shortcuts.

Our goal with the ads we show in News Feed is no different. Every time someone visits News Feed, we choose between thousands of ads to determine the best ones to show – whether it’s from a local business, a well-known brand or a mobile app developer. We aim to show people the most relevant ads based on things such as their interests and the Pages they like. To choose the right ad, we listen to both people and marketers. Marketers tell us which people they think will be interested in their ad. For example, a restaurant might tell us to show an ad to people living in the same city aged 18 to 35. Marketers also tell us how much they are willing to pay to show an ad – which suggests how much they want to reach a specific audience. People also tell us what types of ads they want to see and don’t want to see. When a person interacts with an ad (clicks, likes, comments on, or shares), News Feed learns that these ads are relevant for them. When someone hides an ad, News Feed learns that that person wants to see less of those types of ads. In addition to improving the quality of the ads themselves, we are also continuously trying to optimize when and where we’re showing ads Recent updates to ads content in News Feed We are currently working on some updates to the ads algorithm to improve the relevance and quality of the ads people see. When deciding which ad to show to which groups of people, we are placing more emphasis on feedback we receive from people about ads, including how often people report or hide an ad. That means people should see ads that are increasingly relevant to them, and fewer ads that they might not be interested in. For marketers, this means we are showing ads to the people who might want to see them the most. For example, if someone always hides ads for electronics, we will reduce the number of those types of ads that we show to them. This means that some marketers may see some variation in the distribution of their ads in the coming weeks. Our goal is to make sure we deliver the most relevant ads, which should mean the right people are seeing a specific ad campaign. This is ultimately better for marketers, because it means their messages are reaching the people most interested in what they have to offer. We’ll continue to listen to feedback so we can keep improving the quality of ads in News Feed. Stay tuned for more."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/09/facebook-weekly-highlights/","date":"2013-09-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Trends"],"title":"Facebook Weekly Highlights","text":"Singer Jessie J sends a special message to fans ahead of her “Facebook Live” appearance.

From favorite television shows to sporting events to the latest news; the conversations are happening on Facebook. Last week’s kick-off of the NFL season garnered over 20 million likes, comments, and shares on Facebook by over 8 million people. Over the past few months, we have rolled out a series of products aimed at surfacing the public conversations happening on Facebook including hashtags, embedded posts, and trending topics. We are committed to building features that improve the experience of discovering and participating in conversations about things happening in the world right now, including entertainment, sports, politics and news. Starting today, selected news organizations can begin to integrate Facebook conversations into their broadcasts or coverage by displaying public posts of real-time activity about any given topic. For example, CNN’s New Day can now easily incorporate what people on Facebook have to say about the latest, breaking news event during their show. Partners can also use these tools to show the number of Facebook posts that mention a specific word over a period of time, including a demographic breakdown for the people talking about that topic. For instance, now every week during the ‘What’s Trending’ segment of The Today Show, NBC can easily include how many people on Facebook talked about a popular subject, where it’s getting the most buzz, whether it’s most popular among males or females, and with which age groups. Mass Relevance, a technology company that enables social experiences, is also leveraging these new tools in interesting ways to highlight the trends and conversations happening on Facebook for their media clients. Availability Roll out is starting with a small group of media partners including Buzzfeed, CNN, NBC’s Today Show, BSkyB, and Slate. We will continue to work closely with top media partners to gather feedback and help build even more compelling experiences for their readers and viewers. FAQ What is available today? Today we’re launching two new tools: the Keyword Insights API and the Public Feed API. Public Feed API The Public Feed API displays a real-time feed of public posts for a specific word. Only public posts (from Pages and Profiles of those with ‘Follow’ turned on) are available with this API. Keyword Insights API The Keyword Insights API aggregates the total number of posts that mention a specific term in a given time frame. It can also display anonymous, aggregated results based on gender, age and location. Who has access to these tools? Our current list of partners includes: Buzzfeed, CNN, NBC’s Today Show, BSkyB, Slate. and Mass Relevance. How do I get them? These two tools are currently only available for a small group of trusted media partners."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/09/a-day-in-the-life-at-new-york-fashion-week/","date":"2013-09-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Trends"],"title":"A Day in the Life at New York Fashion Week","text":"Heidi Klum is on the move in Manhattan for one of fashion’s biggest events of the year: New York Fashion Week.

We made a few observations ourselves, but will leave it to the larger audience to pull their own insights from the data: Three teams, UCLA, Northwestern and Oregon State, have no counties in which they were the most-favored team. UCLA is out-fanned in every relevant county by USC, Wisconsin fans dominate over those rooting for Northwestern, and Oregon tops Oregon State Texas, Florida and Ohio State have more of a national following than other teams on the list County-by-county: Texas fans are tops in 543 counties across the country, followed by Florida with 423 counties, Ohio State with 376, Nebraska with 324, and Oregon with 233 counties Most states: Florida fans dominate on a state level with counties in 27 different states. Ohio State and Texas are second and third on the list, with fans in 24 and 23 states, respectively Illinois has the most diversity, with 10 different teams represented across 102 counties; Missouri is second with nine teams In 10 states, every single county favors the same team.

Our goal is to show the right content to the right people at the right time so they don’t miss the stories that are important to them. As part of that we want to make sure that the best quality content is being produced, surfaced and shared. Our latest update to the News Feed ranking algorithm helps ensure that the organic content people see from Pages they are connected to is the most interesting to them. How do we find “high quality content”? While the goal of News Feed is to show high quality posts to people, we wanted to better understand what high quality means. To do this we decided to develop a new algorithm to factor into News Feed. To develop it, we first surveyed thousands of people to understand what factors make posts from Pages high quality. Some of the questions we asked included: Is this timely and relevant content? Is this content from a source you would trust? Would you share it with friends or recommend it to others? Is the content genuinely interesting to you or is it trying to game News Feed distribution? (e.g. asking for people to like the content) Would you call this a low quality post or meme? Would you complain about seeing this content in your News Feed? We used the results of this survey to build a new machine learning system to detect content considered high quality. The system uses over a thousand different factors, such as how frequently content from a certain Page that is reported as low quality (e.g. hiding a Page post), how complete the Page profile is, and whether the fan base for a particular Page overlaps with the fan base for other known high quality Pages. Coming up with an algorithm to detect this is complex, and we will continue to refine it as we get more feedback. Once we developed this algorithm, we added it to our News Feed ranking algorithms as another factor to calculate the score of a News Feed story. We tested the new version of the ranking algorithm with a small segment of our users: * By showing these high quality posts higher up in News Feed, we saw a significant increase in interactions (likes, comments, shares) by the test group with this content People in the test group also hid fewer stories overall These results suggest that this change shows more people higher quality, more interesting stories from the Pages they are connected to. We will be rolling out this update to everyone over the next few weeks. What should you expect? For most Pages the impact should be relatively small, but Pages that are seeing good engagement on their posts could see further increases in reach. The bottom line is that your Page strategy should still stay the same: produce high quality content and optimize for engagement and reach. You can do this by focusing on these tips when creating your Page posts: Make your posts timely and relevant Build credibility and trust with your audience Ask yourself, “Would people share this with their friends or recommend it to others?” Think about, “Would my audience want to see this in their News Feeds?” We’ll continue to keep you posted on our efforts to improve News Feed in our News Feed FYI blog posts – stay tuned for more. *Based on a random sample of 21M users over a one-week period in August"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/08/updates-to-facebook-login/","date":"2013-08-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data & Privacy","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Updates to Facebook Login","text":"Facebook Login gives you a fast and easy way to sign in to your favorite apps. You can skip entering in long registration forms on mobile and the need to remember yet another username and password by logging in through Facebook with a few simple taps. People sign in to their favorite apps using Facebook Login more than 850 million times a month*. As of this month, 81 of the top 100 grossing iOS apps and 62 of the top 100 grossing Android apps in the U.S. use Facebook Login**. Although Facebook Login is widely used, we understand people’s concerns about apps posting on their Timeline or to their friends. For the past several months, we’ve been rolling out a new version of Facebook Login on mobile to address these concerns. With this new update, mobile apps using Facebook Login must now separately ask you for permission to post back to Facebook: Don’t want to share your music playlist or workout routine with friends? You can choose to skip sharing altogether. Clearly separating sharing means people can decide whether they only want to use Facebook Login for fast registration without also sharing back to Facebook. If you want to share later, you still can. In addition to separating sharing requests, we’ve also made Facebook Login load up to 31% faster on mobile***. Our goal is to get you to connect with your favorite apps as quickly and easily as possible. We’ve been working directly with popular mobile apps to help them create great Facebook Login experiences.

Our small team relaunched Snaptu as Facebook For Every Phone in July of that same year, and grew the user base to where it is today. Snaptu’s platform uses the power of servers to accelerate and optimize the way mobile apps work, and is the key to providing a great user experience on low-end devices.

Earlier this year we announced the initial beta of Graph Search, a new way to find people, photos, places and interests on Facebook. In the next few weeks, Graph Search will roll out more broadly to everyone who uses Facebook in US English. Over the past few months, tens of millions of people have helped improve the product just by using it and giving feedback: Speed: Graph Search is faster – both at suggesting potential searches and displaying results Query understanding: Graph Search understands more ways of asking questions Results: Graph Search does a better job at showing the most relevant results first Interface: The search box is easier to see and use Everyone using US English should start seeing their search box automatically updated. This is just the beginning. We’re currently working on making it easier for people to search and discover topics, including posts and comments. We’re also working on getting mobile Graph Search ready. Controlling what appears in Graph Search As Graph Search rolls out more widely, everyone on Facebook will see a notice on their home page with a reminder about how to control what they share and with whom. This follows a similar notice in December that highlighted new privacy tools to help people manage what they share on Facebook. Graph Search results are personalized and unique for everyone, based on what has been shared with them. For example, if you search for “Photos of San Francisco,” you’ll see photos your friends took there and shared with you, as well as Public photos. This means if someone else does the same search, they’re going to see different results because they have different friends, and different photos have been shared with them.

By Alex Walker, Consumer Content Manager & Robert D’Onofrio, Data Editor Miami didn’t just burn it up on the hardwood. LeBron James and his teammates were also a scorcher on Facebook, where adoring Heat fans brought their team the biggest buzz during the 2013 #NBAFinals. People were watching the games and talking to their friends in real time throughout the entire championship series. With more than 125 million Facebook interactions – posts, comments and likes – heading into Thursday night, rapt engagement was the name of the game for professional basketball’s Big Dance. Fans, players, celebrities and NBA legends all joined the conversation, engaging with friends about their favorite (and least favorite) plays, sharing photos, and connecting on Facebook about memorable moments. Deputy NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver, posted many behind-the-scenes photos – including this one of LeBron James – to Facebook during the NBA Finals. Miami’s LeBron James had a hook shot over everyone else on the court, boasting a whopping 70% of all player buzz going into Game 7. James had eight times the number of mentions over San Antonio’s Tony Parker, who was a distant second in Facebook chatter. Teammates Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan came in third and fourth in the rankings, both with about 4% of the buzz. Miami guard, Ray Allen, rounded out the top five. Mapping Facebook buzz for #NBAFinals: The Heat was blazing In fact, Miami was already the most popular NBA team on Facebook leading into the Finals, thanks to LeBron James. James is the most popular NBA player on Facebook, with more than 14 million fans and nearly 400,000 fans in Texas alone. That means he has more fans in the Spurs home state than San Antonio’s five starters, plus teammate Manu Ginobili, combined. Miami had more mentions than San Antonio across the U.S. as a whole, dominating states east of the Mississippi and the West Coast, as evidenced by the red and pinkish hues on the map. Taking a look at the dark-and-light grays, the Spurs managed to nail down Texas and a large swath up through the Great Plains. As for most-talked-about moments, Facebook buzz spiked when Miami’s Ray Allen hit one of the biggest shots of his career, sinking a huge three-pointer to force Game 6 into overtime. “Heat”, “overtime”, “Ray Allen” and even “shuttlesworth” – a reference to Allen’s acting role in the basketball-themed movie “He Got Game” – all had huge increases when he nailed that shot. The terms “Ray Allen” and “shuttlesworth” spiked more than 200,000% and 300,000%, respectively. Chatter about San Antonio’s Tony Parker helped beef up the buzz about his team, especially after throwing a buzzer-beating, “circus shot” at the end of Game 1 to seal the win. Mentions of Parker’s name were running low throughout that game, but spiked more than 8,000% after his 18-foot banker clinched it for the Spurs. Teammate Manu Ginobili’s 24-point performance in Game 5 was another most-talked-about moment. Fans were already buzzing about his retirement announcement, but when Ginobili came off the bench to hit his highest-scoring game of the season, Facebook chatter about the Argentinian native spiked to more than five times the normal baseline. David Beckham watched Game 6 in Beijing, and posted this photo to Facebook #NBAFinals fandom on Facebook included sports legends, music stars and Hollywood celebrities, who cheered on favorite teams, posting opinions and pictures to Facebook. Soccer star, David Beckham, posted a photo during Game 6, writing, “In Beijing, took a short time out to watch Heat vs. Spurs. What a game, incredible.” NBA Rookie of the Year, Damian Lillard, also chimed in with the status update, “32 points, 11 assists, 10 rebounds…And a huuuuge win. But I bet I will see a lot of LeBron hate tonight.” Actor and Texas native, Jamie Foxx, made his allegiance clear with the hashtag, #TexasPride. The NBA brought in some star power for Q&A sessions on its Facebook Page throughout the entire series. ESPN analyst and former Pacers’ player, Jalen Rose, chimed in during the first quarter of Game 2, offering his thoughts on Spurs’ star, Tim Duncan. “Five titles in five appearances would easily cement his legacy as one of the top guys to ever play,” he said in one reply. Current Pacers’ player, Paul George, interacted with Facebook fans during Game 3. On defending LeBron James, George said, “It was tough. He’s able to push the ball in transition, post up, and shoot the ball. That size and strength is a tough matchup for anybody.”"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/06/public-conversations-on-facebook/","date":"2013-06-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Public Conversations on Facebook","text":"By Greg Lindley Every day, hundreds of millions of people use Facebook to share their thoughts on big moments happening all around them. Whether it’s talking about a favorite television show, cheering on a hometown sports team or engaging with friends during a breaking news event—people on Facebook connect with their friends about what’s taking place all over the world. During primetime television alone, there are between 88 and 100 million Americans engaged on Facebook – roughly a Super Bowl-sized audience every single night. The recent “Red Wedding” episode of Game of Thrones, received over 1.5 million mentions on Facebook, representing a significant portion of the 5.2 million people who watched the show. And this year’s Oscars buzz reached an all-time high on Facebook with over 66.5 million interactions, including likes, comments, and posts. To date, there has not been a simple way to see the larger view of what’s happening or what people are talking about. To bring these conversations more to the forefront, we will be rolling out a series of features that surface some of the interesting discussions people are having about public events, people, and topics. As a first step, we are beginning to roll out hashtags on Facebook. Introducing Hashtags on Facebook Starting today, hashtags will be clickable on Facebook. Similar to other services like Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, or Pinterest, hashtags on Facebook allow you to add context to a post or indicate that it is part of a larger discussion. When you click on a hashtag in Facebook, you’ll see a feed of what other people and Pages are saying about that event or topic. Now you can: • Search for a specific hashtag from your search bar. For example, #NBAFinals. • Click on hashtags that originate on other services, such as Instagram. • Compose posts directly from the hashtag feed and search results. As always, you control the audience for your posts, including those with hashtags. Hashtags are just the first step to help people more easily discover what others are saying about a specific topic and participate in public conversations. We’ll continue to roll out more features in the coming weeks and months, including trending hashtags and deeper insights, that help people discover more of the world’s conversations. Learn more about hashtags in the Help Center."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/05/verified-pages-and-profiles/","date":"2013-05-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Verified Pages and Profiles","text":"By Dave Capra, Andy Chung, and Allison Swope Today we’re launching verified Pages to help people find the authentic accounts of celebrities and other high-profile people and businesses on Facebook.

Home is software that turns your Android phone into a great, living, social phone. Home doesn’t change anything related to your privacy settings on Facebook, and your privacy controls work the same with Home as they do everywhere else on Facebook. We wanted to take this opportunity to answer some questions about how Home works and the data we collect through the service. Q: Do I have to use Home to access Facebook on Android? A: No. Home is a new way to experience Facebook, and we hope people enjoy using it. But you won’t get Home unless you specifically choose to do so — either by downloading Home from the Play Store or by purchasing a phone with Home preinstalled. Q: Do I have to continue using Home after I install it? A: No. You can easily turn off Home in your Home Settings. If you like Home but don’t want it to appear as your lock screen, you have that option as well. Q: What information does Home collect? A: Like other parts of Facebook, Home collects information when you interact with the service, such as liking or commenting on a post or sending a message. Home also may collect other information about how you use it. For example, Facebook maintains a list of the apps that you have in the Home app launcher. We store this information in identifiable form for 90 days and use it to provide the service and improve how it works. For devices that come with Home preinstalled, Home can display system notifications, meaning that it will show notifications from apps on your phone. Since these notifications appear in Home, Facebook collects information about the notification (such as which app is generating them) but not the content of the notification itself. We remove identifying information from this data after 90 days. Q: Does Home collect my location? A: Facebook Home doesn’t use location in any way that’s different from the Facebook app you already have on your Android phone. You can learn about how location works across Facebook in our Data Use Policy and Help Center. Q: Can I turn off location services altogether? A: Yes, just as with any other app, you can control the location permission in your phone’s settings. Q: Does Home collect information about what I do in non-Facebook applications? A: No. Home will only see how you interact with Home itself. For example, Facebook could see that you launched a map application using the app launcher, but Facebook would not receive information about what directions you searched for or any other activity within the app itself. Of course, some apps already are Facebook-enabled so that you can share your activity within the app back to Facebook. This kind of integration existed long before we launched Home, and apps that have it will tell you if it is available. Q: How can I find out more about how my data is used? A: The data that we receive through Home is covered by Facebook’s Data Use Policy, which people can view before they activate Home. You also can find more information about Home specifically by reviewing our Home frequently asked questions, which are available in our Help Center and through the Home login screen."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/04/introducing-home/","date":"2013-04-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Home","text":"By Tom Alison and Adam Mosseri Today we’re introducing Home – a new way to turn your Android phone into a great, living, social phone. We all want to share and connect. That’s how we discover new information and build meaningful relationships. But today, phones are built around tasks and apps. To see what’s happening with your friends, you pull out your phone and navigate through a series of separate apps. We asked ourselves _if sharing and connecting are what matter most, what would your phone be like if it put your friends first? Our answer is Home. Home isn’t a phone or operating system, and it’s also more than just an app. Home is a completely new experience that lets you see the world through people, not apps. Cover feedFrom the moment you wake up your phone you become immersed in cover feed. Cover feed replaces the lock screen and home screen. It’s a window into what’s happening with your friends – friends finishing a bike race, your family sharing a meal or an article about your favorite sports team. These are the beautiful, immersive experiences that you get through Home. You might have missed these updates before, but now they’re a central part of the Home experience. Since Home is both your lock screen and home screen, the content comes right to you. You can flip through to see more stories, and double tap to like what you see. Cover feed is for those in-between moments _like waiting in line at the grocery store or between classes _when you want to see what’s going on in your world. Chat headsWith chat heads you can keep chatting with friends even when you’re using other apps. When friends send you messages, a chat head appears with your friend’s face, so you see exactly who you’re chatting with. Messages reach you no matter what you’re doing – whether you’re checking email, browsing the web, or listening to music. You can move chat heads around and respond to messages. And since SMS is integrated into Facebook Messenger for Android, chat heads include Facebook messages as well as texts. NotificationsCover feed is great for seeing everything going on in the world. But when something happens that’s more important and directed at you, like a friend posting on your timeline, you’ll receive notifications with their profile pictures. To open notifications, just tap them. And if you don’t want to deal with them right now, you can just swipe to hide them and keep flipping through cover feed until you want them back. AppsIt’s as easy to get to your apps in Home as it is on any other phone. Swipe up to see your favorite apps in the launcher. There’s also a screen containing all of your apps, and you can drag your favorite apps to the launcher. How To Get HomeHome will be available as a free download from the Google Play Store starting April 12. Home works on the HTC One X, HTC One X+, Samsung GALAXY S III and Samsung GALAXY Note II.

With the new design, now Facebook has the same look and feel on mobile, tablet and web. For example, the left-hand menu is accessible anywhere you go on Facebook. You also have a way to jump right to the top of News Feed whenever new stories come in. We’ll be rolling out the new design slowly over the coming weeks on web and mobile. If you’d like to get it early, visit www.facebook.com/newsfeed and add yourself to the waiting list. These design updates will be available on your iPhone and iPad in the coming weeks and to Android soon after."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/02/graph-search-some-favorite-searches/","date":"2013-02-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Graph Search: Some Favorite Searches","text":"By Maxime Boucher There are now hundreds of thousands of people using the beta of Graph Search and we’re really interested to see how people are using the product to help us understand what we can improve.

Hollywood’s biggest night is inherently social, and from the announcement of this year’s nominees, to the red carpet and the ceremony itself, people from around the world connected with fans, filmmakers and celebrities in record numbers, with 66.5 million Oscar-related interactions on Facebook. Here is a deeper look at which films, people and moments shaped the conversation of the 2013 Oscar season. The event scored a 7.17 on the Facebook Talk Meter, trumping last year’s awards ceremony, and we saw the most buzz in the Northeast (New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut) followed by California. “Oscars” received three times more mentions this year, while the Best Picture nominees racked up twenty times more mentions than 2012. “Les Miserables” had the most Likes of this year’s top films, and despite being set in France, the film’s largest body of fans are in London. It was also the favorite film among women and people ages 13 to 17. Still, it was “Django Unchained” that racked up the most mentions among its peers, and was the clear Best Picture choice among men. Loyal fans of the film’s director Quentin Tarantino, who picked up the award for Best Original Screenplay, were also likely to have Liked “Pulp Fiction” on Facebook. While Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln” didn’t take home the Best Picture prize, it was a favorite among people ages 45 and up and history buffs; people who Like the film on Facebook are also highly connected with The History Channel. The film’s star Daniel Day-Lewis took home the trophy for Best Actor, and was the most-buzzed about actor in New York City and Los Angeles since his nomination was announced up to the show. His female counterpart, Best Actress Jennifer Lawrence, was the most-talked about nominated actress across the U.S. leading up to the awards, and was the front-runner among men on Facebook. Women favored “Zero Dark Thirty” actress Jessica Chastain. Best Picture “Argo” was the most-talked about winner of the night. Mentions of the film increased by 2,460% and mentions of Ben Affleck increased by 23,500% as the director, star and producer made his acceptance speech. Affleck also launched his new Instagram account from the red carpet and shared behind-the-scenes photos throughout the night, including this one of his name being engraved on the Oscar trophy itself. (For more Oscar-related Instagram highlights, click here.) Other moments that had everyone talking were host Seth MacFarlane‘s impersonation of the Flying Nun, presenter Mark Wahlberg‘s appearance with talking teddy bear Ted, and a performance by Best Original Song winner Adele."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/02/protecting-people-on-facebook/","date":"2013-02-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Data & Privacy","Facebook","Integrity & Security"],"title":"Protecting People On Facebook","text":"Last month, Facebook Security discovered that our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack.

Last year’s Super Bowl was the most talked-about sporting event of the year on Facebook and the second most-mentioned event of 2012, just behind November’s presidential election. In 2012, Super Bowl Sunday also saw the second largest volume of posts in a single day on Facebook, just behind New Year’s Day. This year, a family rivalry, surprise halftime show appearance and major power glitch gave people even more to talk about during the matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers. We tallied mentions of keywords made in posts and comments throughout the game to see exactly which moments bubbled to the top, receiving the most talk on Facebook. TOP MOMENTS OF SUPER BOWL XLVII 1. Ravens win the Super Bowl 2. Beyonce’s halftime performance 3. Blackout in the Superdome 4. Jacoby Jones’ 108-yard kickoff return for a Ravens touchdown (and Justin Tucker’s field goal kick) 5. Joe Flacco’s 56-yard pass to Jacoby Jones for a Ravens touchdown (and Justin Tucker’s field goal kick) 6. Joe Flacco’s 13-yard pass to Anquan Boldin for a Ravens touchdown (and Justin Tucker’s field goal kick) 7. Frank Gore’s six-yard run for a 49ers touchdown (and David Akers’ field goal kick) 8. Destiny’s Child surprise appearance with Beyonce during the half time show 9. Ray Lewis’ retirement 10. David Akers’ field goal kick from 27-yard line HALFTIME SHOW Beyonce’s halftime show was the second most talked-about moment of the night. Mentions of “Beyonce” started to increase just before 8 PM ET. By 8:22 PM ET, mentions of her name had jumped nearly 49,000%. Destiny’s Child’s surprise appearance was the eighth most-discussed moment from the night; mentions of the group, as well as “Kelly” and “Michelle” all jumped over 10,000%. Fans kept track of Beyonce’s setlist too, with tracks like “Crazy in Love,” “Single Ladies,” and “Halo” trending throughout the performance, followed by fans declaring Beyonce had “killed it” – a phrase which jumped more than 40,000% as she took her bow. POWER OUTAGE The most unexpected moment of the night also became one of the night’s most unforgettable, making the blackout inside the Louisiana Superdome the third most talked-about moment of the game. The lights cut out just minutes after Beyonce’s halftime show, inspiring posts about her “killing it” and “stealing all the electricity.” Mentions of “lights” on Facebook jumped 66,000% around 8:37 PM ET, and discussion of the “blackout,” “power,” and the “outage” continued for the next several minutes. MOST-MENTIONED PLAYERS Here are the most-talked about players from the game, in order of total mentions they received: 1. Ray Lewis 2. Joe Flacco, named this year’s Super Bowl MVP (Last year’s Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning was one of the most talked about public figures on Facebook in 2012.) 3. Colin Kaepernick 4. Jacoby Jones 5. Torrey Smith 6. Vernon Davis 7. Michael Crabtree 8. Anquan Boldin 9. Frank Gore 10. David Akers THE HARBAUGH BOWL Even though his brother’s team won the Super Bowl, San Francisco head coach Jim Harbaugh received 98% more overall mentions in posts and comments than Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh. Jim Harbaugh also saw a spike of 3,300% toward the end of the game, with the controversial no-call on potential pass interference that would have given the 49ers the lead with a just a few minutes left in the game. However, mentions of “John Harbaugh” jumped 13,300% in the first few minutes after the blackout. Mentions of “Harbaugh” skyrocketed during the playoffs, increasing 1800% after the 49ers won the NFC championship and increasing by another 5600% after the Ravens secured the AFC title, making this year’s NFL championship game a Harbaugh vs. Harbaugh Super Bowl. While people who Like Jim Harbaugh on Facebook are also extremely likely to Like the 49ers, they’re also fans of other Bay Area professional sports teams like the San Francisco Giants. On the opposing side, a high correlation of people who Like Baltimore coach John Harbaugh also Like the Raven’s Facebook page, but are also much more likely to Like individual Ravens players. BEHIND THE SCENES Singer Alicia Keys took fans behind the scenes of the game’s pre-show, posting photos and status updates to Facebook as she prepared to sing the National Anthem. FANS BY THE NUMBERS Of the 1.7 million people who Like the 49ers page on Facebook, 63% are male, 37% are female and 69% are under 34 years-old; all of the top 10 cities of San Francisco fans on Facebook are located in California, with the exception of Las Vegas. Of the 1.4 million people who Like the Ravens page on Facebook, 66% are male, 34% are female and 78% are under 34 years-old. Aside from having a younger fan base, the Ravens also had a higher number of top cities outside of its home state. Washington D.C., Houston, Atlanta, Chicago and even Los Angeles all made the list of top 10 cities of Ravens fans on Facebook. Still, the Super Bowl is a truly international event on Facebook; other countries buzzing about this year’s game are Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Austria and Australia.

Your friend will be notified instantly about your gift, and will receive a Facebook Card in the mail a few days later.

Graph Search aims to make the information people have already shared with each other more useful and in a way that is completely personal and respects privacy settings. We wanted to take this opportunity to answer these questions about how Graph Search works, and to emphasize how important it is to us that people understand how to control who can see what they share on Facebook. Before Graph Search began rolling out, we highlighted a set of upgraded privacy tools on Facebook encouraging people to review what they’ve shared. The upgraded privacy tools, and the reminder to use them, are part of an ongoing effort to encourage people to make choices that are right for them. Privacy works consistently across Facebook, not just on Graph Search. When you control who you share your information with, you determine who it’s shared with across Facebook – including News Feed, timeline and in Graph Search. Below are some of the most common questions around Graph Search and privacy. The video and links below give more info on how privacy works on Facebook and in Graph Search. How Privacy Works With Graph Search Links for more info: facebook.com/graphsearch/privacy facebook.com/help/graphsearch/privacy ____ Frequently Asked Questions How do I control what information shows up about me in Graph Search? You control the audience of information you share on Facebook. For each piece of content you own, you can choose whether that information is shared with Public, Friends, Only Me, Custom or specific lists of people. Graph Search is aware of these privacy settings. Go to your Activity Log to review and control who can see what you share on Facebook. How do I control the audience of my likes? You control who you share your interests and likes with on Facebook. To do this, go to your timeline and click the “Likes” box at the top. Each category of interests and likes has its own privacy setting. If, for example, you choose to only let your friends see your interests, then your friends are the only people who will see that you like those interests anywhere on Facebook: in News Feed, on your timeline and in Graph Search. For pages that are not part of a category, you can see and change the privacy of these likes under the “Other Pages You Like” section. Can people see things about my friends through Graph Search? You can choose who can see your friend and family lists across Facebook, on your timeline, in News Feed and Graph Search. Just as you control who can see your friend lists, your friends control who can see their friend lists. Someone might be able to tell that you’re friends with another person — and search based on that friendship — if they can see your friendship on the other person’s timeline. So if you’re concerned about people searching for info about your friends, you can ask your friends to limit who can see their friends list as well. Some people have asked us why search works this way. The reason is that we want people to be clear on who can see info about them not only in Graph Search, but elsewhere on Facebook — such as on timeline or in News Feed. Privacy controls work consistently across Facebook. How do I view and control what photos of me are on Facebook? Last year, we launched improved privacy tools that let people see what they’ve shared, to see what photos have been tagged of them, and to be able to take action if there’s something they don’t like. In Activity Log, you can now review all posts and things you’re tagged in. For example, with photos, you can see photos you’ve uploaded and been tagged in. You can then untag yourself from any of those photos, or, if you didn’t post it, send a message to the owner of the photo asking them to take it down from Facebook."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2013/01/introducing-graph-search-beta/","date":"2013-01-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing Graph Search Beta","text":"By Tom Stocky and Lars Rasmussen Facebook’s mission is to make the world more open and connected. The main way we do this is by giving people the tools to map out their relationships with the people and things they care about. We call this map the graph. It’s big and constantly expanding with new people, content and connections. There are already more than a billion people, more than 240 billion photos and more than a trillion connections. Today we’re announcing a new way to navigate these connections and make them more useful. We’re calling it Graph Search, and it starts today with a limited preview, or beta. When Facebook first launched, the main way most people used the site was to browse around, learn about people and make new connections. Graph Search takes us back to our roots and allows people to use the graph to make new connections. Graph Search will appear as a bigger search bar at the top of each page. When you search for something, that search not only determines the set of results you get, but also serves as a title for the page. You can edit the title – and in doing so create your own custom view of the content you and your friends have shared on Facebook. Graph Search and web search are very different. Web search is designed to take a set of keywords (for example: “hip hop”) and provide the best possible results that match those keywords. With Graph Search you combine phrases (for example: “my friends in New York who like Jay-Z”) to get that set of people, places, photos or other content that’s been shared on Facebook. We believe they have very different uses. Another big difference from web search is that every piece of content on Facebook has its own audience, and most content isn’t public. We’ve built Graph Search from the start with privacy in mind, and it respects the privacy and audience of each piece of content on Facebook. It makes finding new things much easier, but you can only see what you could already view elsewhere on Facebook. We’re very early in the development of Graph Search. It’s only available in English today and you can search for only a subset of content on Facebook. Posts and Open Graph actions (for example, song listens) are not yet available. We’ll be working on these things over the coming months. The first version of Graph Search focuses on four main areas — people, photos, places, and interests. People: “friends who live in my city,” “people from my hometown who like hiking,” “friends of friends who have been to Yosemite National Park,” “software engineers who live in San Francisco and like skiing,” “people who like things I like,” “people who like tennis and live nearby” Photos: “photos I like,” “photos of my family,” “photos of my friends before 1999,” “photos of my friends taken in New York,” “photos of the Eiffel Tower” Places: “restaurants in San Francisco,” “cities visited by my family,” “Indian restaurants liked by my friends from India,” “tourist attractions in Italy visited by my friends,” “restaurants in New York liked by chefs,” “countries my friends have visited” Interests: “music my friends like,” “movies liked by people who like movies I like,” “languages my friends speak,” “strategy games played by friends of my friends,” “movies liked by people who are film directors,” “books read by CEOs” The Graph Search beta starts today. Go to www.facebook.com/graphsearch to get on the waitlist. The roll out is going to be slow so we can see how people use Graph Search and make improvements. Update as of 7/8/13: In the next few weeks, Graph Search will roll out more broadly to everyone who uses Facebook in U.S. English. Learn more here. Update as of 8/7/13: Graph Search has now been launched to everyone using Facebook in US English. We look forward to your feedback. Enjoy and explore the graph.

Graph Search is a new way for you to find people, photos, places and interests that are most relevant to you on Facebook. What is Graph Search useful for? Graph Search will help you instantly find others, learn more about them and make connections, explore photos, quickly find places like local attractions and restaurants, and learn about common interests like music, movies, books and more. All results are unique based on the strength of relationships and connections. What can I search for? With Graph Search, you can search for people, photos, places and interests. How do I search? Type your search into the blue bar at the top of the page. As you start to type, suggestions appear in a drop down. You can refine your search using the tools on the right-hand side of the page. Some example searches include: · People who like tennis and live nearby · Photos before 1990 · Photos of my friends in New York · Sushi restaurants in Palo Alto my friends have liked · Tourist attractions in Italy visited by my friends How are you rolling this out? Graph Search is in a limited preview, or beta. That means Graph Search will only be available to a very small number of people who use Facebook in US English. Update as of July 8, 2013: In the next few weeks, Graph Search will roll out more broadly to everyone who uses Facebook in U.S. English. Learn more here. How can I get Facebook Graph Search? You can sign up for the waitlist at www.facebook.com/graphsearch Does Graph Search change any of my current privacy settings? No. Graph Search follows your current privacy settings. You can only search for content that has been shared with you.

Lessin UPDATE December 20, 2012: Last week we told you about some new privacy tools to help manage who can see what you share on Facebook. These tools have started rolling out globally and will begin to roll out in the US starting today. We believe that the better you understand who can see the things you share, the better your experience on Facebook can be. Today’s updates include Privacy Shortcuts, an easier-to-use Activity Log, and a new Request and Removal tool for managing multiple photos you’re tagged in. We’re also adding new in-product education that makes key concepts around controlling your sharing clearer, such as in-context reminders about how stuff you hide from timeline may still appear in news feed, search, and other places. We continue to strive toward three main goals: bringing controls in context where you share, helping you understand what appears where as you use Facebook, and providing tools to help you act on content you don’t like. 1. In Context: More controls right where you need them Privacy Shortcuts Up until now, if you wanted to change your privacy and timeline controls on Facebook, you would need to stop what you’re doing and navigate through a separate set of pages. Today we’re announcing new shortcuts you can easily get to. Now, for key settings, you just go to the toolbar to help manage “Who can see my stuff?” “Who can contact me?” and “How do I stop someone from bothering me?” You can also access Help Center content from these shortcuts. App Permissions The first time you log into a new app, it asks for permission to use your info to personalize your experience. Some apps also ask to post to Facebook. Before today, these two requests were part of the same screen and happened at the same time. Soon you’ll start to see these requests happen separately, so you have more control over what you share. For example, a person can grant a music app the ability to read their public profile and friends list to personalize their experience in the app, but decline to allow it to post what they listen to to Facebook on their behalf. Many of the apps you use will move to this new model, but some will not – for example, games apps on Facebook.com will not change. For more information on how these new permissions will work, see our developer blog. Retiring the old “Who can look up my timeline by name?” setting Facebook started as a directory service for college students, and today we offer a whole variety of services, such as news feed, photo uploads and mobile messaging. As our services have evolved, our settings have, too. Everyone used to have a setting called “Who can look up my timeline by name,” which controlled if someone could be found when other people typed their name into the Facebook search bar. The setting was very limited in scope, and didn’t prevent people from finding others in many other ways across the site. Because of the limited nature of the setting, we removed it for people who weren’t using it, and have built new, contextual tools, along with education about how to use them. In the coming weeks, we’ll be retiring this setting for the small percentage of people who still have it. 2. Understanding: In-product education Along with the overall effort to continue bringing privacy controls up front, we’re adding in-context notices throughout Facebook. For example, we’ve created a series of messages to help you understand, in context, that the content you hide from your timeline may still appear in news feed, search and other places. Updated Activity Log Last year we introduced Activity Log. Activity Log makes it easy to see the things you’ve posted on Facebook, make changes to the audience of past photos and other posts, and choose what appears on your timeline. The updated Activity Log has new navigation, so you can easily review your own activity on Facebook, such as your likes and comments, photos of you, and posts you’ve been tagged in. It also has new ways to sort information, for example: Now you can quickly see public photos you’re tagged in and have hidden from your timeline, but which still appear in other places on Facebook. 3. Action: New tools to manage your content New Request and Removal tool Within the updated Activity Log, you now have a Request and Removal tool for taking action on multiple photos you’re tagged in. If you spot things you don’t want on Facebook, now it’s even easier to ask the people who posted them to remove them. Go to the “Photos of You” tab, select multiple photos, and ask friends to take down the shots you don’t like – you can even include a message about why this is important to you. The tool also lets you untag multiple photos at once, keeping in mind that while untagged photos don’t appear on your timeline, they can still appear in other places on Facebook, such as search, news feed, or your friends’ timelines. These updates and new tools will begin rolling out at the end of 2012."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2012/12/discover-new-places-with-nearby/","date":"2012-12-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Discover New Places with Nearby","text":"by Josh Williams Today we’re announcing updates to Nearby in the Facebook for iOS and Android apps that make it easy to discover new places your friends like.

It was the most diverse and global year for social games to date – for those on Facebook.com, as well as games built with Facebook for iPhone, iPad and Android. We’ve pulled together the list of the 25 top rated games, based on games that launched in 2012 and received the highest star ratings from players and engagement levels over the course of the year. The music trivia game SongPop was the crowd favorite this year, with social mobile games Dragon City and Bike Race coming in at second and third. It was the most international year for social games. The majority of games came from outside the U.S., ranging from France, Spain and the U.K. to Brazil, South Korea, Australia, and Turkey. Zynga led the U.S. with the most games on the list including their latest game, FarmVille2 and the social mobile game Draw Something. It was a big year for action/arcade games too, with most of the apps falling into the relatively new category. Fifty six percent of the games are available on Facebook.com, while the remaining 44% are social mobile games (available on iPhone, iPad and Android). Your top rated games of the year: • SongPop (FreshPlanet) • Dragon City (Social Point) • Bike Race (Top Free games) • Subway Surfers (Kiloo) • Angry Birds Friends (Rovio) • FarmVille 2 (Zynga) • Scramble with Friends (Zynga) • Clash of Clans (Supercell) • Marvel: Avengers Alliance (Playdom) • Draw Something (Zynga) • Hay Day (Supercell) • Baseball Heroes (Syntasia) • ChefVille (Zynga) • CSR Racing (NaturalMotion Games) • Candy Crush Saga (King.com) • Matching With Friends (Zynga) • Legend Online (OASIS GAMES) • Jurassic Park Builder (Ludia) • Dungeon Rampage (Rebel Entertainment) • Pockie Ninja II Social (NGames Limited) • Jetpack Joyride (Halfbrick) • Social Empires (Social Point) • Bil ve Fethet (Peak Games) • Ruby Blast Adventures (Zynga) • Pyramid Solitaire Saga (King.com) *More on methodology: This list was generated using the same ranking system we use in the App Center, based on both star ratings by users, positive and negative user signals and engagement levels between the date range of January 12, 2012 –November, 10, 2012. You can learn more about how the App Center recommendation engine ranks apps here. The list takes into account games that launched in 2012 on Facebook.com, as well as mobile games integrated with Facebook.

We tracked 71.7 million election-related mentions made by users within the U.S. — enough to score a 9.27 on the Facebook Talk Meter, the highest score of U.S.-based events that we have measured for 2012. To put that in perspective, the 2012 Super Bowl scored a 8.62 on the Talk Meter, while the San Francisco Giants winning the World Series tracked at a 6.1. Election discussion on Facebook was a global phenomenon, too – outside the U.S., Election Day scored an 8.28 on the Talk Meter, with additional buzz to bring the total to 88.7 million mentions made worldwide on Nov. 6 pertaining to the election. Throughout the campaign, men were slightly more likely to discuss the politics on Facebook, but the gap narrowed on Election Day, when women and men shared their reactions in nearly equal proportion. Unsurprisingly, people in Washington, D.C. were frequently the most likely to be discussing the campaign — D.C. led the way during all four debates and on Election Day itself. But the day before the election, the most buzz came from New Hampshire, perhaps a nod to the fact that the election’s first votes were cast in the tiny town of Dixville Notch, N.H. In the run-up to the election, the 35 to 54 and 55+ age groups were the most likely to discuss each of the debates on Facebook. But on Election Day, this skewed a bit younger – Facebook buzz was highest among men and women aged 25 to 34, the youngest we saw at any point we tracked. Looking at the entire campaign season, “Big Bird” was the most popular phrase, eking out a victory over the runner-up from the second debate, “Binders Full of Women.” Both saw a slight resurgence on Election Day — with “Big Bird” winning by a factor of 10. Here’s a list of the most-discussed terms on Facebook sampled at various moments during Election Day: Election Day (11/6), 7 AM PT 1. Vote – all forms: Go vote (top phrase) / voting / get out and vote / I voted / the right to vote 2. Election Day / Happy Election Day 3. Line 4. Polls 5. Voice 6. Halo 7. Eagles 8. Exercise your right to vote 9. Freedom 10. Our Country Election Day (11/6), 2:30 PM PT 1. Vote / Voted / Votes 2. Obama 3. Election 4. Romney 5. Ballot 6. Polling 7. Ohio 8. Freedom 9. Campaign 10. Machines Election Day (11/6), 6 PM PT 1. Obama 2. Romney 3. Win / Wins / Winning / Win the election 4. Results / Election Results 5. Close 6. Electoral / Electoral Map / Electoral Votes 7. Won 8. If Romney Wins 9. CNN 10. Coverage / Election Coverage Election Day (11/6), 10 PM PT 1. Obama 2. 4 more years / 4 years 3. President / President Obama 4. Thank God 5. Won / Wins 6. America 7.

Over the past year, many developers have brought what was traditionally only possible offline – music discovery through friends – into all types of music apps on the web and for mobile. Since September 2011, 62.6 million songs have been played 22 billion times through timeline apps — that’s about 210,000 years worth of music. This is happening across all types of music apps, from those that tailor music to your tastes, to apps that recommend music based on the time of day and what you’re doing. Here are some music apps taking off: 8tracks: The social Internet radio app enables people to select play lists based on mood, genre or artist. 8tracks users generate four million shares back to Facebook weekly, resulting in 65 million story impressions, with Facebook now ranking as one of 8tracks’ major sources of referral traffic. BandPage: BandPage enables musicians to manage their bios, music, videos, photos and shows across the web. People who visit the website of their favorite artists using BandPage can “favorite” a song or share that they are “going” or “want to go” to that artist’s concert. The amount of music-related activity shared by people through BandPage has grown by 3x in the last few months. KKBOX: People who use the Taiwan-based KKBOX app can listen to more than 1.5 million songs via iPhone, iPad and Android and share their listening activity with friends. The app also shows lyrics so people can sing along to their favorite tunes. Over 50 million music shares to timeline occur each month, and over 50% of new users log in with Facebook. Saavn: The India-based mobile and desktop app has experienced exponential growth since launching in December of last year, powering active Facebook-connected users in more than 200 countries. Saavn has generated nearly 2.3 billion impressions, daily referral traffic from Facebook has grown 30x, and monthly music streams have grown by over 200%. Songza: People who use Songza can choose curated play lists based on mood or activities. In a recent 30-day period, Songza saw 1 million referrals from Facebook, up from 650,000 the month before, with Facebook-connected users listening about 20% longer than other users. SoundTracking: People can use the web and mobile app to identify the music playing around them and share the track to timeline with a photo, location and comment. SoundTracking’s monthly active users are up more than 50% from last month’s. In addition to these startups, we continue to see growth from companies like Deezer, iHeartRadio and Spotify. For example, Deezer has seen the number of people using their app triple since the beginning of the year, and they are now adding 50,000 new users per day.

As a result, Facebook is focused on ensuring that those who are eligible to vote know where they can cast their ballots and, if they wish, share the fact that they voted with their friends. Similar to 2008 and 2010, U.S. Facebook users over age 18 will see a message at the top of their News Feed reminding them that it is Election Day and to go vote. The Facebook message will also contain a link to the Facebook Polling Place Locator (http://bit.ly/Fbppl), an application that lets users find out where they can vote. The app was developed with data from the non-partisan Voting Information Project (http://votinginfoproject.org) and is a joint project of VIP, Facebook and Microsoft. We also will employ several social features that let people on Facebook encourage their friends to participate in Election Day. Users over age 18 will be able to click an “I’m Voting” or “I’m a Voter” button and post a story to their Facebook Timeline telling their friends that they have voted. This will also appear in their friends’ News Feeds. Individuals will also see the faces of their friends that have already shared that they are voters and a real-time counter will display the number of people in the United States who have clicked the button. More than 5.4 million people indicated on Facebook that they voted on Election Day 2008 and more than 12 million people clicked the button during the 2010 midterm election. About one third of a million more people showed up at the ballot box in the U.S. in 2010 because of the Facebook message on Election Day, a recent study led by the University of California, San Diego found (read more: http://bit.ly/FbUCSD). After clicking the “I’m Voting” or “I’m a Voter” button today, users will be able to visit a real-time heat map on our Facebook Stories website that will display in aggregate where people on Facebook are voting throughout the country. Anyone can view that map at facebookstories.com/vote. Throughout Election Day and night, the U.S. Politics on Facebook Page (http://www.facebook.com/uspolitics) will be a hub for information, photos, and other election-related activity taking place on Facebook. The U.S. Politics on Facebook Page will also provide insights from the Facebook Talk Meter, which will measure Facebook election buzz on a 10-point scale."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2012/11/charitable-contributions-on-facebook-gifts/","date":"2012-10-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News","Strengthening Communities"],"title":"Charitable Contributions on Facebook Gifts","text":"By Jared Morgenstern We’re excited to announce that we are launching a new test feature on Facebook Gifts: now you can now use Facebook to make a charitable contribution in celebration of a friend or a family member.

Over the course of the Olympics, we saw more than 116 million posts and comments relating to the games, and athletes collectively added 12.2 million likes to their Pages on Facebook between the opening and closing ceremonies. We took a deeper dive into our data to see what really resonated between Olympians and their fans on Facebook. Page Growth – More than 1M people liked Jamaican Usain Bolt’s Page during the games, bringing his total to more than 8.1M. – More than 850K people liked Michael Phelps’ Page during the games, bringing his total to more than 6.3M. Local favorites became world-renowned athletes throughout the Olympics with their spirit and perseverance – a couple of athletes from Great Britain led the way here… – Jessica Ennis saw an increase of 632%, bringing her to a total of 801K people connected to her Page – starting from just 108.7K. – Tom Daley saw an increase of 672%, bringing him to a total of 1M – starting from just 120K. …and there were the athletes who went into the Games relatively unknown and became stars with their wins and presence on Facebook. Gymnasts take the gold medal here: – Jordyn Wieber started out with 33K people who had liked her Page – and won over the hearts of more than 288K more, bringing her to a total of 324K (+818%) – Marcel Nguyen won more than silver for Germany – he added 193K new people to his Page’s starting base of 7.5K – for a new total of more than 200K (+2524%) – Gabby Douglas wins the “Rising Star” award – adding more than 591K people to her starting base of a slightly over 14K on her Page – she’s now at more than 600K (+4045%) Nicknames Part of the fun of the Olympics is getting to know the athletes over the 17 days of competition – even their nicknames. On July 31, the day Michael Phelps became the most-decorated Olympian, we saw an increase of more than 1200% in the volume of mentions containing his nickname, “Baltimore bullet.” Female fans led this charge, with a 2700% increase in mentions of the nickname – though men helped the cause with a 925% increase. And, perhaps not surprising, Phelps’ home-state Maryland showed pride in their medal-studded “Baltimore bullet,” with the largest increase across states all the states, at 2800%. Fans of all ages across the country embraced Gabby Douglas’ nickname, “Flying Squirrel.” Across the board, there was an increase of almost 2000% in mentions on August 2, the day she was awarded the gold medal in the Individual All-Around gymnastics competition. Increases were split evenly across male and female users – starting around 800% for the youngest people on Facebook (aged 13-17); jumping well over 2000% for people in their 20s and 30s; and increasing steadily on up to almost a 3000% increase for some of our older audience. New Jersey, Texas, and Maryland were especially enamored of this term of endearment, showing the highest increase in usage. Athlete Posts During the Olympics, athletes provided fans with a plethora of behind-the-scenes look at their London Olympic experience. From what life was like inside the Olympic Village to hearing how the athletes unwound after hours, numerous Olympians shared personal photos from the games, thoughts on their performances and more on Facebook. These posts were both thoughtful and inspiring and spurred comments from fans that ranged from congratulatory words to sympathetic thoughts.

People in these countries will now see the App Center bookmark on the left side of their home page on Facebook.com and in the Facebook apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android. Approximately 80% of people active on Facebook each month are outside the U.S. and Canada. The global rollout of the App Center will continue over the coming weeks so that more people can discover high quality games and apps with friends. In the month since the App Center initially launched, it has helped millions of people discover new mobile and web apps. Specifically, game developer Kixeye has seen a lift in the quality of organic installs, and found that App Center traffic produces better than average revenue per user for its games War Commander and Battle Pirates. Similarly, a growing percentage of new players in Disney’s Marvel: Avengers Alliance are originating from the App Center, and those users are more engaged than those who come through other channels. Today we are accepting submissions from developers with translated apps for the App Center. (More information on our Developer Blog here.) Some of the most popular apps and games on Facebook were built by developers based outside of the U.S., such as Diamond Dash (Wooga, Germany), Bubble Witch Saga (King.com, U.K.), Jetpack Joyride (Halfbrick, Australia), Angry Birds Friends (Rovio, Finland), Ninja Showdown (Noritown, South Korea), Soundcloud (Germany), Spotify (Sweden), and Deezer (France).

Among the no. 1 ranked landmarks across the 25 cities: – 7 are sports stadiums/arenas – 6 are public areas: squares/avenues/parks/gardens – 2 are amusement parks – 2 are concert arenas – 2 are shopping-related: shopping centers/malls Looking deeper into the data, we saw that shopping is popular internationally: malls and outdoor markets appear within the top 10 landmarks for 19 of 25 cities, including Sao Paolo’s Mercado Municipal, Seoul’s Dongdaeum and Melbourne’s Queen Victoria market. Amusement parks like Johannesburg’s Gold Reef City, Moscow’s Gorky Park, Copenhagen’s Tivoli Gardens and Seoul’s Lotte World were among the top 10 places to check-in. Restaurants like the Hard Rock Cafes in Buenos Aires, Delhi and Barcelona, TGI Fridays in Norway, and Bella Paulista Casa de Paes in Sao Paulo were favorites too. Cities with warmer climates had more check-ins to outdoors spots, like St. Kilda Beach in Melbourne and the Wynyard Quarter wharf in Auckland, while colder climes had more activity in concert halls or bars. Six of Moscow’s 10 most popular slots belong to bars and clubs. Examining check-ins by season helped us uncover some summer trends. Music festivals like Glastonbury and Lollapalooza appear as top summer check-ins. Sports venues also ranked highly in the U.S., with Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco each featuring stadiums or arenas in their top 10 list. Baseball was also very popular in Tokyo, where the Tokyo Dome won out, while in other cities, soccer, rugby, and cricket venues were popular summer hangouts. We found some interesting comparisons within individual cities. In New York, the American Museum of Natural History garnered more check-ins than its neighbor across Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Rome’s Spanish Steps is one the city’s most social spots followed by the Trevi Fountain, just 10 minutes away. City architectural treasures and famous green spaces were popular throughout New York, Berlin, London, Rome – and Paris, where the Avenue des Champs-Élysées beat out the famous Eiffel Tower. Methodology: All data was aggregated anonymously across check-ins made on Facebook or by 3rd-party apps using the Facebook API. Transportation hubs (airports, train stations, bus stations, etc.) were excluded. Data for top landmarks by city was aggregated across all check-ins since the launch of product (August 2010) and ranked to identify the top landmarks."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2012/06/announcing-the-explore-london-2012-page/","date":"2012-06-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Facebook"],"title":"Announcing the Explore London 2012 Page","text":"London 2012 is set to be the most talked about sporting event in history as fans and athletes from around the world come together to share their Olympic stories on Facebook.

To help everyone get the most out of the Games, Facebook announced the Explore London 2012 page. The page features athletes, national teams and individual sports, with broadcasters and sponsors coming soon. Creating a personalized Olympic experience is as easy as finding your favorite and clicking ‘like’. Launching the Explore London 2012 page at an event in London, Joanna Shields, VP and Managing Director EMEA at Facebook said: “These Olympics, every story has the potential to be heard. On Facebook, all athletes can have an audience, and every fan can track how their heroes are doing, support them, encourage them, and share their stories with the world.” Also attending the London event was Mark Adams, Director of Communications at the IOC. Mr Adams said: “The Olympics has been connecting fans with memorable sporting events and moments for more than a century, first in the stadiums, then through television and now on social media. It makes sense to give fans the best experience we can and these will be the first truly ‘social’ Games. “I’m sure that through Facebook and all of our other social media channels we will manage to bring a new dimension to the Games for a new audience.” The page is available in 22 languages.

On any given day more than half a billion people share billions of stories, updates and photos. What has amazed us over the past eight years is how people use these same tools and social dynamics to address important issues and challenges in their communities. Last year in Missouri, Facebook users tracked down and returned treasured mementos to families who thought they’d lost everything in the Joplin tornado. In Japan, people used Facebook to locate family and friends following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Smaller acts of kindness happen millions of times a day on Facebook. We never could have anticipated that what started as a small network would evolve into such a powerful tool for communication and problem solving. As this happens, we hope to build tools that help people transform the way we all solve worldwide social problems. Today, more than 114,000 people in the United States, and millions more around the globe, are waiting for the heart, kidney or liver transplant that will save their lives. Many of those people – an average of 18 people per day – will die waiting, because there simply aren’t enough organ donors to meet the need. Medical experts believe that broader awareness about organ donation could go a long way toward solving this crisis. And we believe that by simply telling people that you’re an organ donor, the power of sharing and connection can play an important role. Starting today, you can add that you’re an organ donor to your timeline, and share your story about when, where or why you decided to become a donor. If you’re not already registered with your state or national registry and want to be, you’ll find a link to the official donor registry there as well. Facebook’s mission is simple: to make the world more open and connected. But the Facebook community has also shown us that simply through sharing and connecting, the world gets smaller and better. Even one individual can have an outsized impact on the challenges facing another, and on the world. At Facebook, we call that the power of friends.

In recent months, we’ve seen a distressing increase in reports of employers or others seeking to gain inappropriate access to people’s Facebook profiles or private information. This practice undermines the privacy expectations and the security of both the user and the user’s friends. It also potentially exposes the employer who seeks this access to unanticipated legal liability. The most alarming of these practices is the reported incidences of employers asking prospective or actual employees to reveal their passwords. If you are a Facebook user, you should never have to share your password, let anyone access your account, or do anything that might jeopardize the security of your account or violate the privacy of your friends. We have worked really hard at Facebook to give you the tools to control who sees your information. As a user, you shouldn’t be forced to share your private information and communications just to get a job. And as the friend of a user, you shouldn’t have to worry that your private information or communications will be revealed to someone you don’t know and didn’t intend to share with just because that user is looking for a job. That’s why we’ve made it a violation of Facebook’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities to share or solicit a Facebook password. We don’t think employers should be asking prospective employees to provide their passwords because we don’t think it’s the right thing to do. But it also may cause problems for the employers that they are not anticipating. For example, if an employer sees on Facebook that someone is a member of a protected group (e.g. over a certain age, etc.) that employer may open themselves up to claims of discrimination if they don’t hire that person. Employers also may not have the proper policies and training for reviewers to handle private information. If they don’t—and actually, even if they do—the employer may assume liability for the protection of the information they have seen or for knowing what responsibilities may arise based on different types of information (e.g. if the information suggests the commission of a crime). Facebook takes your privacy seriously. We’ll take action to protect the privacy and security of our users, whether by engaging policymakers or, where appropriate, by initiating legal action, including by shutting down applications that abuse their privileges. While we will continue to do our part, it is important that everyone on Facebook understands they have a right to keep their password to themselves, and we will do our best to protect that right."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2012/03/improving-the-photos-experience/","date":"2012-03-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Improving the Photos Experience","text":"Today we’re announcing a few enhancements to our photo viewer, including high-resolution photos and fullscreen viewing.

New apps from Foursquare, Nike, The Onion, VEVO, Fandango, Viddy, Endomondo, and RootMusic give people more ways to add their location, fitness, video and media interests to their timeline and share what they love with friends. In the past two months, nearly 3,000 timeline apps have launched. These startups are seeing increased engagement and growth: • Pinterest grew its daily active Facebook user base by 60%. • Goodreads increased daily traffic by 77%. • Pose saw 5X growth in signups on its website and mobile app. Here’s a look at the newest timeline apps at SXSW: Foursquare: Foursquare uses many of the new features announced last week to bring its location app to timeline. People can now add their Foursquare check-ins to their timelines and maps, share their badges and see the top places they’ve checked into. Nike: The Nike+ FuelBand is becoming more social through a series of Facebook integrations. As of last week, people can use the Nike FuelBand iPhone app to find friends and see a leader board of how much Fuel they’ve earned versus their friends. Soon, people will be able to post their achievements and milestones directly to their timeline. The Onion: Laugh alone no more. People can now log into TheOnion.com with their Facebook account to add The Onion content directly to their timeline and share articles and videos as they read and watch. Friends can discover articles in News Feed, and get personalized recommendations on TheOnion.com, making “America’s finest news source” more social. VEVO: Vevo introduced a new integration that lets people sign into Vevo.com with their Facebook account, get personalized video playlists based on the artists they’ve liked, discover new music through friends, and post any music video from Vevo’s massive library directly to their timeline. Fandango: Movie fans now have another way to bring their favorite films to their timeline. The new Fandango timeline app lets people add the clips they watch, the movies they rate and any films they want to see. Viddy: Viddy, the mobile app for creating quick videos and adding filters, now lets people add clips to their timelines as they shoot. Now when people film videos from a vacation or everyday life, they can share them to Facebook and collect their clips on the Viddy app for timeline. Endomondo: Endomondo brought its fitness app to timeline so people can share their workouts, progress and favorite routes with friends on Facebook. Sharing fitness activities with friends makes it easier to coordinate workouts and cheer each other on to new fitness goals. RootMusic: The new RootMusic timeline app lets people mark their favorite songs and artists and the concerts they plan on attending from the Facebook Pages of bands, like The Stone Foxes. As people click “favorite”, “going to go” and “wants to go” on a RootMusic app, their picks will be added to their timeline.

Starting today, you also have interest lists—a whole new way to keep up with stuff you care about and tidy up your experience on Facebook. Interest lists can help you turn Facebook into your own personalized newspaper, with special sections—or feeds—for topics that matter to you. You can find traditional news sections like Business, Sports and Style or get much more personalized—like Tech News, NBA Players, and Art Critics. Interests feature public figures and Pages related to a particular topic, and are put together by people like you. The top stories from each interest appear in your news feed so you can scan interesting headlines or click through to read more posts. In the coming weeks, you’ll see the Add Interests link in your left-hand bookmarks. When you do, you can subscribe to lists on almost any topic. For example: If you love football, subscribe to the NFL Teams interest list for a gridiron-focused feed. No need to check on each team in the NFL, your favorite athletes’ profiles, and ESPN. If you’re into politics, subscribe to the 2012 US Presidential Candidates interest list to see updates from all the campaigns, or get posts from major newsoutlets like CNN, Fox, MSNBC, and the Wall Street Journal. Don’t see a list for one of your interests? Make your own lists to organize your favorite content or help others discover new topics. Just go to the Interests page, and click Create List. Choose to let others subscribe to your new list, or keep it private."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2012/02/announcing-offers-new-placements/","date":"2012-02-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Announcing Offers, New Placements","text":"Today we’re announcing a new product called Offers and new placements for premium advertising and Sponsored Stories.

A few weeks ago, more than 60 new timeline apps went live. These apps – many in the lifestyle category – broadened what was available to people on Facebook beyond the music, news and video apps that were introduced at f8 in September. Music apps like Spotify, Songza and Deezer are seeing dramatic increases in sharing and music discovery. People have shared more than 5 billion songs through these apps, and their availability has increased from eight to 50 countries. We’re now seeing new content discovery and increases in traffic and engagement happening more broadly for companies of all sizes. For large companies, they’ve been able to scale and re-introduce their products to new audiences. For startups with small teams and a small user-base, open graph has driven a lot of discovery and growth, allowing many companies to double the size of their user base in weeks. Here are a few examples from startups: Shopping and Fashion Pinterest: Since launching their open graph integration less than a month ago, the number of Facebook users visiting Pinterest every day has increased by more than 60%. The virtual pinboard site has made it fun and easy to share the items you’ve pinned and follow the boards of people you find interesting. Pose: The fashion trend and style discovery app has seen a 5X increase in daily web signups for their website and mobile app by helping people share the different products they like with their friends. Fab.com: The design shopping site and mobile app has seen a 50% increase in traffic from Facebook as a result of their social shopping timeline app and live feed implementation. Entertainment Artfinder: The art discovery and collector site has seen a 60% increase in time spent on the site by new visitors from Facebook by giving people a way to share art with friends. Rockmelt: Rockmelt users are adding 14 new articles every day through the social browser, driving 20% new traffic and new users to the site. Food Foodspotting: The food finding and sharing app has seen a 3X increase in number of visits and activities shared by helping people share the dishes they want, try and ate with friends on Facebook Foodily: The foodie and recipe site has seen a 4X increase in new users by allowing people to share what they crave and are cooking. These apps have a few things in common. They’re built around something people care about and identify with, they enable people to share things they want their friends to see, and they provide easy ways to control the social experience. For example, Pinterest makes it easy for people to pin and share items (Figure 1). Pinning an item is simple and has a clear call to action to enter a message (Figure 2). People can also easily control when items are added to timeline (Figure 3). This sort of integrated experience not only helps to generate meaningful content, but also deepens engagement. For these apps, every person can share their activities with their friends on Facebook, starting a loop that drives discovery for new users and re-engagement for existing users. For more information on how to do this, please see our guide. For additional details, please see our checklist and best practices. We have approved hundreds of new actions since opening up the platform and are continuing to review your submissions. In the past weeks, apps like Vogue Paris, Votizen, Identified, Boxee, MetaCafe and Shopkick have all introduced new open graph integrations. To get started, check out our tutorial."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2012/01/introducing-new-apps-for-timeline/","date":"2012-01-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Introducing New Apps for Timeline","text":"by Carl Sjogreen Apps bring your timeline to life Once you’ve added an app, you can begin updating your timeline with your activities as they happen. For example, if you love design, shopping or fashion, you can add the Pinterest or Pose apps to make your favorite items part of your timeline. New Apps for Timeline If you love to cook, you can add the Foodily app to your timeline and share your latest dishes. If your friends have added the Foodily app, you can discover new recipes with each other, as you’ll see their updates in the ticker and their timeline, and possibly News Feed. If you’re a traveler, you can add the Gogobot and TripAdvisor apps to bring a virtual passport to your timeline, and show your friends where you’ve been and share tips about your favorite spots from around the world. Soon, there will be apps for all types of interests, as more apps will launch over time. Whether you love snowboarding, gardening, hiking, or knitting, or something else, there will be an app for you. How to add apps to your timeline Timeline apps are for the activities you want to share with friends. You choose when to add an app, and you decide who can see it. After you’ve added an app, you can always remove posts directly from timeline, and you can also edit your settings from your personal Activity Log. You and your friends can start adding apps to your timeline today to discover new recipes, places to go, events to attend, and more.

Whether it’s at a concert with a bunch of people or on a long car ride with your best buddy, we love listening to music with our friends. But what if you could listen to music with your friends when you’re alone, like at work, at home or on the go? Today, with music services on Facebook, there’s a new way to listen with friends. This feature lets you listen along with any of your friends who are currently listening to music. You can also listen together in a group while one of your friends plays DJ. You can listen to the same song, at the exact same time—so when your favorite vocal part comes in you can experience it together, just like when you’re jamming out at a performance or dance club. How It Works Look for the music note in the chat sidebar to see which of your friends are listening to music. To listen with a friend, hover over their name, and click the Listen With button. The music will play through the service your friend is using. When a new song plays, you’ll come along for the ride, discovering new music while your friend DJs for you. You’ll also have the option to chat about what you’re listening to. As other people start listening along, they’ll join the party in a group chat. You can control who you’re listening along with through your settings. Learn more here. Rollout Starts Today Now, you can experience enjoying music together with your friends no matter where you are. This feature will start rolling out over the next few weeks.

Over the next few weeks, everyone will get timeline. When you get timeline, you’ll have 7 days to preview what’s there now. This gives you a chance to add or hide whatever you want before anyone else sees it. You can learn more about these new features by taking the quick tour available at the top of your timeline. If you want to get timeline now, go to the Introducing Timeline page and click “Get Timeline.” Or you can wait until you see an announcement at the top of your home page. Originally posted on December 15, 2011: By Paul McDonald We recently announced our plans to introduce Facebook Timeline, an entirely new kind of profile. Timeline gives you an easy way to rediscover the things you shared, and collect your most important moments. It also lets you share new experiences, like the music you listen to or the miles you run. Starting today, timeline is now available everywhere. Here are some tips to help you get started. 7-day preview period When you upgrade to timeline, you’ll have seven days to review everything that appears on your timeline before anyone else can see it. You can also choose to publish your timeline at any time during the review period. If you decide to wait, your timeline will go live automatically after seven days. Your new timeline will replace your profile, but all your stories and photos will still be there. If you want to see how your timeline appears to other people, click the gear menu at the top of your timeline, and select “View As.” You can choose to see how your timeline appears to a specific friend or the public. Feature or hide stories As you explore your timeline, you may see stories that you want to feature, like your graduation or the day you bought your first car. There might also be stuff that you want to remove or hide from your timeline. To feature something on your timeline, roll over the story and click the star to expand it to two columns. Or you can click the pencil to hide, delete or edit a post. Use the privacy dropdown to adjust who can see any of your posts. You can even select “Only Me” for posts you want to keep but don’t want others to see. See all your activity With timeline, now you have access to a new tool called Activity Log. Your activity log is a place where you can review all your posts and activity, from today back to when you first started using Facebook. Only you can see your activity log. You’ll see two dropdown menus next to each story in your activity log. The first lets you see and adjust the privacy of a post. The second lets you decide if you want the post to appear on your timeline. You can feature, hide or delete any of your posts. To quickly find a certain type of story, click the “All” dropdown at the top of your activity log and select what you’re looking for. For example, you can choose to see only photos or posts from apps. Get timeline today To get timeline, simply go to the Introducing Timeline page and click “Get Timeline.” Or you can wait until you see an announcement at the top of your profile. Starting today, timeline will also be available on Android and m.facebook.com. We hope you enjoy exploring what’s on your timeline, and adding new stories and experiences. We’ll be continuing to improve timeline over the next few months.

People use it to share everything from the small stuff, like their thoughts on an article, to the most important events of their lives, like the photos of their wedding or the birth of their child. The evolution of your profile Back in the early days of Facebook, your profile was pretty basic – just your name, a photo, where you went to school…stuff you’d cover in the first five minutes you met someone. Over time, your profile evolved to better reflect how you actually communicate with your friends. Now you can can share photos of what you did last weekend, and updates about how you feel today. But since the focus is on the most recent things you posted, more important stuff slips off the page. The photos of your graduation get replaced by updates about what you had for breakfast. Say you’re catching up with an old friend – would you rather find out that they had eggs this morning, or hear about their new dream job? The way your profile works today, 99% of the stories you share vanish. The only way to find the posts that matter is to click “Older Posts” at the bottom of the page. Again. And again. Imagine if there was an easy way to rediscover the things you shared, and collect all your best moments in a single place. Introducing timeline – a new kind of profile With timeline, now you have a home for all the great stories you’ve already shared. They don’t just vanish as you add new stuff. Timeline is wider than your old profile, and it’s a lot more visual. The first thing you’ll notice is the giant photo right at the top. This is your cover, and it’s completely up to you which of your photos you put here. As you scroll down past your cover, you’ll see your posts, photos and life events as they happened in time. You choose what’s featured on your timeline. You can star your favorites to double their size or hide things altogether. Filling in the blanks If important parts of your story aren’t included on your timeline, you can go back to when they happened and add them. Or go to your private activity log. This is where you’ll find everything you shared since you joined Facebook. Click on any post to feature it on your timeline so your friends can see it, too. Add apps to your timeline Introducing a new kind of social app that lets you show the things you like to do on your timeline – the music you listen to, the recipes you try, the runs you take and more. These apps also help you discover what your friends are up to. You can even join in if you want: play the song they’re listening to, or watch the same TV show. You can start adding some of these new apps today, but timeline won’t be available for a few weeks. When you get your timeline, you can choose to publish it immediately or take a few days to review what’s there and add anything that’s missing. Now, you and your friends will finally be able to tell all the different parts of your story – from the small things you do each day to your biggest moments. What will you create? We can’t wait to find out."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2011/09/interesting-news-any-time-you-visit/","date":"2011-09-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Interesting News, Any Time You Visit","text":"By Mark Tonkelowitz When you visit Facebook, you should see the things you’re most interested in, like status updates from your family and closest friends. Last week, we announced improvements to Friend Lists and a new Subscribe button to help you see more of what you care about, and less of what you don’t. But it’s not just the people you hear from that make your News Feed interesting. It also matters how much you visit Facebook. If you haven’t returned in a week, you may want to see a summary of top stories first. If you’ve already visited several times that day, you probably care more about recent news. Starting today, it will be easier to keep up with the people in your life no matter how frequently or infrequently you’re on Facebook. News Feed: See What Matters at the Top When you pick up a newspaper after not reading it for a week, the front page quickly clues you into the most interesting stories. In the past, News Feed hasn’t worked like that. Updates slide down in chronological order so it’s tough to zero in on what matters most. Now, News Feed will act more like your own personal newspaper. You won’t have to worry about missing important stuff. All your news will be in a single stream with the most interesting stories featured at the top. If you haven’t visited Facebook for a while, the first things you’ll see are top photos and statuses posted while you’ve been away. They’re marked with an easy-to-spot blue corner. If you check Facebook more frequently, you’ll see the most recent stories first. Photos will also be bigger and easier to enjoy while you’re scrolling through. Ticker: Join Friends in Real-Time News Feed often has a time lag. Usually when you’re on Facebook, a lot of your friends are too. Until now, there hasn’t been an easy way to see and chat with your friends about photos, articles, and other things they’re posting in real-time. The new ticker helps you do just that. Ticker shows you the same stuff you were already seeing on Facebook, but it brings your conversations to life by displaying updates instantaneously. Now when a friend comments, asks a question or shares something like a check in, you’ll be able to join the conversation right away. Click on anything in ticker to see the full story and chime in – without losing your place. If you have a wider screen, slide the grey bar between ticker and chat up or down to adjust how many updates you see at a time. To control who can see your updates anywhere on Facebook, including in ticker and News Feed, adjust your sharing control or apps settings. We hope these improvements make your conversations on Facebook more lively, no matter how often you visit.

Maybe you don’t want to see every time your brother plays a game on Facebook, for example. Or maybe you’d like to see more stories from your best friends, and fewer from your coworkers. You also couldn’t hear directly from people you’re interested in but don’t know personally—like journalists, artists and political figures. With the Subscribe button, we’re making it easier to do both. In the next few days, you’ll start seeing this button on friends’ and others’ profiles. You can use it to: Choose what you see from people in News Feed Hear from people, even if you’re not friends Let people hear from you, even if you’re not friends Choose What You See in News Feed You’re already getting your friends’ posts in News Feed. With the Subscribed button, you can choose how much you see from them: All updates: Everything your friend posts Most updates: The amount you’d normally see Important updates only: Just highlights, like a new job or move You can also decide what types of updates you see. For example, you could see just photos from one friend, no stories about games from another, and nothing at all from someone else. Choosing what you see is optional. If you don’t want to change what you see from someone, just ignore the button. Subscribe to Interesting People The Subscribe button also lets you hear from interesting people you’re not friends with—like journalists, artists and political figures. If you see a Subscribe button on your favorite blogger’s profile, this means you can subscribe. Just click the button to get their public updates right in your News Feed. Just like with friends, you can choose how many and what types of updates you see after you’ve subscribed. Get Your Own Subscribers If you’d like to share your public updates with more than just friends, you can get a Subscribe button on your profile, too. People who subscribe to you will get posts you set as “Public” in their News Feeds. This is an entirely optional feature – you need to opt in. Just like with friends, you can choose how many and what types of updates you see after you’ve subscribed. Once you allow subscribers, you can decide who can comment and what notifications you get.

In addition, new settings will be added to make it easier to turn off third-party applications or websites. Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg officially announced the changes in a blog post today at blog.facebook.com. “When we started Facebook, we built it around a few simple ideas,” said Zuckerberg. “When people have control over what they share, they want to share more. When people share more, the world becomes more open and connected. Over the past few weeks, the number one thing we’ve heard is that many users want a simpler way to control their information. Today we’re starting to roll out changes that will make our controls simpler and easier.” The company’s new privacy controls reflect wide-ranging consultation with the office of Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) and a number of online privacy and consumer advocacy groups. These include the Center for Democracy and Technology, Consumer Action, Future of Privacy Forum, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Progress and Freedom Foundation, NetChoice, CATO Institute, TRUSTe, Technology Policy Institute, and Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The consultations have proven extremely helpful in both clarifying and communicating Facebook’s privacy principles, and have greatly contributed to the design and implementation of the new privacy controls. These updated controls will start rolling out today and will be live for all Facebook users in the coming weeks. Zuckerberg first announced Facebook’s intention to make these changes in a Washington Post op-ed that detailed principles by which Facebook operates: People have control over how their information is shared. Facebook does not share personal information with people or services users don’t want. Facebook does not give advertisers access to people’s personal information. Facebook does not sell any of people’s information to anyone. Facebook will always be a free service for everyone. Today’s announcement focuses on the first two of these principles. Making Control Simple One control for content: A new simple control makes it easy to share on Facebook with friends, friends of friends or everyone—all with just one click. The corresponding settings are immediately applied and displayed in an easy-to-understand grid. At the same time, Facebook has maintained its more granular settings for those who want to customize their level of sharing. These settings now all appear on a single page for easier access. Retroactive control: People who choose the more restrictive “Friends Only” or “Friends of Friends” options with the simple control will have the corresponding setting for all the content they posted previously for sharing. Thus, a person can make all the content they’ve ever shared on Facebook more private with just a couple of clicks. Future products: Facebook commits to carry over people’s privacy choices for new products that facilitate sharing. Thus, if someone chooses “Friends Only” for “Sharing on Facebook,” new products that have privacy settings will be automatically set to “Friends Only.” This means Facebook users don’t have to worry about new settings in the future. Prioritizing simplicity: Granularity of control has always been a primary objective in Facebook’s privacy design. Starting with the changes announced today, the company will also prioritize ease-of-use in its privacy design. Fewer privacy changes: Facebook’s goal is to make privacy-related changes with less frequency and to work within the framework announced today as it continues to innovate new features and products. Less Publicly Available Information Significantly less public information: Facebook has drastically reduced the amount of information that is available to everyone. This information is now limited to name, profile picture (should a user choose to have one), gender (though this can be hidden on the profile), and networks (should the user join any). Privacy controls for Pages: Connections to Pages, which were previously available to everyone, will have privacy settings that work for both ends of the connection. People can prevent others from seeing Pages on their profile and from seeing them in the “People who like this” boxes on the Pages themselves. Applications will also need to ask for explicit permission in order to access any of your Pages that are not visible to everyone. Easier Opt Outs Full control over how applications and websites on Facebook Platform access information: In response to requests, Facebook has added a simple way for people to completely turn off Platform applications and websites, so that your information is not shared with applications, even information available to everyone. Easier opt-out of Instant Personalization Pilot Program: Facebook has also made it easier for people to turn off the instant personalization program, which prevents those, and any future, applications in the program from accessing their information. Granular data permissions for applications and websites: Facebook also highlighted the new controls users have over information shared with applications and websites on Facebook Platform. With the new data permissions model, applications must obtain specific approval before gaining access to any personal information that a user has not made available to “Everyone.” What People Are Saying “Facebook’s users have spoken and made it clear that they want control of their information. Despite all rumors to the contrary, privacy is not dead, it is on its way to a comeback in the form of simplified controls and better policies,” said Leslie Harris, President, Center for Democracy and Technology. “While more work still needs to be done, these changes are the building blocks to giving people what they want and deserve.” “People care about privacy now more than ever. We are pleased that Facebook has pledged to improve user control and choice and we look forward to working together to help them follow through on this commitment,” said Michelle De Mooy, Senior Associate at Consumer Action. “We believe the company must work with a broad coalition of consumer and privacy advocates, regulators, and legislators in order to raise the bar and lead the industry toward empowering and protecting consumers online. We also hope that this step forward from Facebook will send a message to industry that strong privacy standards aren’t just good policy, they’re good business.” “The message that all companies should be taking away from this is that managing digital identity is critically important to Internet users of all ages and backgrounds. Facebook is taking steps that are essential for user trust by providing users with additional control over the personal data they share. As sites, services and devices grow increasingly complex, the challenge for Facebook and for others going forward is to continue to seek innovations that ensure that privacy tools can be intuitive for users,” said Jules Polonetsky, Director, Future of Privacy Forum. “Facebook’s announcement should remind us all that online services actively compete in the market of public opinion based on their commitment to empowering users to make their own choices about privacy,” said Berin Szoka, Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Internet Freedom at Progress and Freedom Foundation. “Facebook has affirmed that commitment by responding to user demands to allow users to restrict visibility of their friends and their ‘likes,’ and to opt-out completely from sharing of information with third-party applications and external websites. Just as important is the improved user interface, which maximizes both granularity of user control and ease of use—two things that are always in tension. Achieving both complexity and simplicity requires ongoing, iterative process of innovation.” “These new features give consumers more choice and more control over their information—a win for both Facebook and its users,” said Daniel Castro, Senior Analyst for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “Facebook’s latest changes show that companies are responding appropriately to their customers’ concerns about privacy. In this case, market and customer feedback are more effective tools for meeting consumer needs than heavy-handed privacy regulations that would only impede innovation.” “Providing people with true privacy choices that are both simple and transparent is no easy task. Facebook’s changes to make its privacy settings more accessible, as well as to provide broader opt-out choices, reflect both the company’s deep commitment to control and its ability to quickly innovate and incorporate feedback,” said Fran Maier, President of TRUSTe. “We will continue to work closely with Facebook to ensure that it lives up to the commitments it has made to its users.” Announcement Fact Sheet The Changes Completely redesigned the privacy settings page to be much more simple. Created one control for content. A new simple control makes it easy to share on Facebook with friends, friends of friends or everyone—all with just one click. The corresponding settings are immediately applied and displayed in an easy-to-understand grid. At the same time, Facebook has maintained its more granular settings for those who want to customize their level of sharing. These settings now all appear on a single page for easier access. Significantly reduced the amount of information that is always visible to everyone. Friends and Pages (your connections) can now be restricted to anyone you want. To help people recognize you, your name, profile picture, networks, and gender are always open to everyone (though half of these you don’t need to add). Given you more control over how applications and websites access your information. Now you can completely turn off Facebook Platform applications and websites, which means that your information will not be shared with applications. We also made it very simple to turn off instant personalization. You can ensure that your information is not shared with current or future instant personalization applications by un-checking the box to “Enable instant personalization”. Get a better understanding of how you like to share on Facebook. The new presets help us understand the overall privacy level you’re comfortable with for the things you share. As we roll out new products, we want to apply the right setting for you at the outset—eliminating the need for you to check your setting each time a new feature is introduced. We’re committed to carrying over your presets for new products that facilitate sharing. So, if you choose the “Friends Only” preset for “Sharing on Facebook”, new products that have privacy settings will be automatically set to “Friends Only” as well. Not changing anything about our advertising programs: we never sell any of your personal information to anyone. There’s a rumor that the more openly you share your information the more money we make, but it’s just wrong. Advertisers may target ads to people according to certain demographics, but they receive only anonymous data reports. We don’t share your personal information with our advertisers. Data points Reduced the number of settings required to make all information private from nearly 50 to less than 15. Introduced presets that cover 18 individual settings for sharing with one single control—two clicks to control what had been more than 100 different options. Consolidated 10 settings on 3 separate pages into 7 settings on one page. Reduced the number of separate pages in privacy center from 13 to 8. FAQ Q. How are users being informed of these changes? As we roll this out, we will be posting a message to all users on the homepage pointing them to information that explains the changes. In addition, we have and will continue to devote significant resources to educating people about the control they have on Facebook. Before rolling out these changes we will update our robust privacy education materials, including a new privacy guide (http://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php), instructional videos posted to our blog and Facebook Page, and numerous FAQs in our Help Center. Finally, we are committed to working with non-profit organizations to raise awareness among their constituents. Q. Were users involved in this redesign? Yes, we incorporated four rounds of iterative user testing into the redesign process. In each of these tests we worked with a variety of users, from those that classified themselves as very open to those that classified themselves as very closed. In each round of testing users were given a variety of tasks to measure both their understanding of the features, as well as their experience using the privacy controls. We then continuously modified the explanatory language, the placement and the visual presentation of the controls based on the users’ experiences. Q. Where can people provide feedback on these changes? We hope these changes demonstrate the tremendous respect we have for the hundreds of millions of people who use Facebook every day, and our commitment to ensuring that each of these people continues to feel comfortable sharing and connecting. Today, as always, we encourage our users to submit their thoughts and feedback: http://www.facebook.com/privacyfeedback Q. How soon until everyone gets the new privacy settings? We are working hard to make the simpler privacy controls available to everyone as soon as possible. However, as is our standard practice with most products we launch, we will begin with a slow roll out and will gradually increase the number of people who with new controls. This process started today and will be complete in the next couple of weeks."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2009/12/facebook-asks-more-than-350-million-users-around-the-world-to-personalize-their-privacy/","date":"2009-12-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Data & Privacy","Facebook"],"title":"Facebook Asks More Than 350 Million Users Around the World To Personalize Their Privacy","text":"Service Gives Users New Tools to Control Their Information PALO ALTO, Calif. — December 9, 2009 —Setting a new standard in user control, Facebook announced today that it is calling on its more than 350 million users to review and update their privacy settings—a first among major Internet services. In addition, Facebook will be rolling out easy-to-use tools to empower people to personalize control over their information—based on what the content is, why they are sharing it, when, and the audience they seek to reach. “Facebook is transforming the world’s ability to control its information online by empowering more than 350 million people to personalize the audience for each piece of content they share,” said Elliot Schrage, Vice President of Communications, Public Policy and Marketing. “We’ve always designed Facebook to enable people to control what information they share with whom—it’s the reason our service continues to attract such a broad and diverse group of users from around the world. We’re proud of the latest evolution we’re announcing today and we will continue to innovate to serve users’ changing needs.” The tools launching today are part of Facebook’s continuing innovation and a response to requests from both users and experts. Different versions of these suggestions were developed and tested extensively since the beginning of this year. The resulting new features include added control for each piece of content users share, simplified privacy settings, help in choosing settings, and expanded privacy education materials. Adding Control For Each Item Users from all over the world have requested the ability to dynamically control who sees each individual piece of content. Facebook’s new Publisher Privacy Control—the main place to add content such as photos and status updates—provides this function and is rolling out to users today. This feature will enable people to easily select a privacy setting for every post they make at the time they create it. For example, a person may want to share some posts with everyone, such as her opinion on a new movie. Other times, that same person may want to share more personal updates like her new phone number or a photo of her children with a narrower community, such as her Friends or members of Friend Lists she has created. By making selections in a drop-down menu, users can easily tailor their posts to specified audiences. Simplified Privacy Settings Facebook’s current privacy model revolves around “networks”—communities for schools, companies or regions. However, some of the regional networks like Australia and Turkey now have millions of members, which is why Facebook is moving toward a more personalized model of control. Regional networks will be removed and replaced with four basic control settings—Friends, Friends of Friends, Everyone and Customized—that are simpler and apply uniformly to all users worldwide. In addition, many users have expressed that the current set of privacy choices are confusing or overwhelming. In response, the Privacy Settings page has been completely redesigned with a goal of making the controls easy, intuitive and accessible. Based on user feedback, Facebook has consolidated some settings and grouped them in ways that are more logical and straightforward. Help In Choosing Settings Starting today, Facebook will also take the unprecedented step of presenting more than 350 million users with a Transition Tool—a transparent process requiring people to review and update their privacy settings. This tool will start with a message that explains the changes and will then let users update their settings. Users will be presented with two options: preserving their old settings or accepting recommendations from Facebook. The recommendations are designed to help people connect and share—consistent with the reasons they joined Facebook—in a responsible way by taking into account how users have shared that information previously and recognizing that users may consider some information more sensitive. Potentially sensitive information, like phone numbers, is assigned a more restrictive recommendation. Facebook will suggest that users retain settings they have previously configured, but if users have not changed their settings in the past, Facebook’s recommendations will be pre-selected. Users can change any of the selections and they must confirm all selections before they take effect. Once users have updated their settings, they will be shown a confirmation page that will let them review their selections again. The confirmation page also provides a link to the full Privacy Settings page where users can modify settings further as they see fit. Of course, users will be also able to change their settings whenever they want. Expanded Privacy Education As users move through the Transition Tool, they’ll be presented with an opportunity to “Learn More.” Through this link, they’ll reach Facebook’s new Privacy Center, a comprehensive guide that helps users understand and control how they share information. The Privacy Center explains Facebook’s principles of user control and related features. It also offers links to other privacy-related material on and off Facebook. Even after a user has completed the Transition Tool, the Privacy Center will always remain available from links throughout the site. In addition to the Privacy Center, Facebook is paying special attention to educating new users. New users will be encouraged to learn more about privacy once they complete the registration process and will have the opportunity to view a New User Guide, which will include a section about privacy and link to the new Privacy Center. In addition, new users will also receive specific privacy education messages within important Facebook pages. Finally, the first time users seek to share content using the new Publisher Privacy Control, they will be shown a message that indicates who will see their post; it will also offer a link to additional information. “One of our primary goals is to consistently improve Facebook and expand what our users can do through the site, and that includes providing them with new tools to help control their information,” said Chris Cox, Vice President of Product Management. “The features we’re announcing today aren’t the end point, but are simply the latest step in our iterative process. Great suggestions helped us get here, and we look forward to the feedback that will help us develop the next innovation in privacy and user control.” Additional Information No change or impact on advertising programs: Facebook has never shared personal information with advertisers except under the direction and control of a user. These new tools do not alter that policy or practice. Common set of publicly available information: Facebook’s latest privacy policy, announced in October, indicated that certain basic information—a user’s name, profile picture, gender, current city, Friend List and Pages—would be categorized as “publicly available.” The overwhelming majority of users already make all of this information available to everyone and this label was chosen to ensure that users understand that it is possible for this information to be viewed by others. However, users can still avoid being found in searches or prevent contact from non-friends. Special protections for minors: As part of the controls announced today, Facebook is limiting the visibility of content created by users under age 18. If a minor seeks to share information with “Everyone,” the widest circle of people who will actually be able see that content are his or her “Friends”, “Friends of Friends” and members of school or work networks he or she has joined.

Those who use Facebook’s new public profiles, currently called Facebook Pages, will be able to share all types of content with an unlimited number of users. Shared content can be brief messages or may include photos and videos and will soon appear in News Feed, Facebook’s popular service that streams what people you care about are doing, thinking, saying, watching, photographing and reading right now. Facebook users can then easily make connections, comment on posted content and join the online conversations with the famous – just as they can with a family member, friend or colleague. To showcase the new, rich features, Facebook partnered with several world-renowned individuals and organizations: • President Obama is rallying support for new U.S. policies and initiatives • “The Oprah Winfrey Show” is giving viewers a new way to interact • U2 is connecting with fans of their new album • CNN is providing breaking developments to news junkies • Stanford University is sharing its discoveries and knowledge • The NBA’s star athletes are posting photos and video highlights from their games • LIVESTRONG is empowering cancer survivors and advocates in the global fight against cancer and raising awareness about the LIVESTRONG Global Cancer Campaign “We are excited about our new presence on Facebook and the new capabilities it offers for us to connect with fans and potential guests,” said Sheri Salata, executive producer, “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” “Facebook is such a cool and easy way for me to connect with my fans while I’m on the road,” said Britney Spears. “I love that I can update my status, blog and post videos and photos all in one place.” “This new Facebook profile for ‘Anderson Cooper 360’ allows us to have a constant dialogue with a community on Facebook,” said David Doss, senior executive producer of “Anderson Cooper 360.” “We’ll be communicating breaking news and insider perspective directly from the 360 newsroom.” “Connecting our supporters with our new profile helps us build awareness for our cause, spread vital disaster relief information and quickly mobilize millions of volunteers through updates and Facebook events,” said Gail McGovern, president and CEO of the American Red Cross.

In addition, Facebook offers best-practice suggestions for public figures, non-profits or other organizations, entertainers and bands. This can be found at http://www.facebook.com/publicprofiles. Evolving to Profiles for Everyone and Everything on Facebook Facebook is moving towards offering everyone and everything on the site the same experience as with profiles – personal web pages that currently represent each of the more than 175 million users on Facebook. In the next week, all administrators of Facebook Pages will have the opportunity to make changes to the new design and can publish the updated design for all users to see whenever they choose. On March 11th, these Pages will automatically change to the new profile design. Public profiles will be familiar to all Facebook users because they have the same look and function as the current profiles, including these popular features: Wall – The Wall displays the most recent and relevant information on a profile. The Wall is a collection of what a celebrity or public entity shares as well as what those connected to them are sharing. People can now easily comment on the content posted. Publisher – Just as a user can add content such as status updates, photos, and videos to any of their connections’ profiles, the Publisher provides a simple interface for sharing content. Tabs and Applications – Celebrities and public entities choose the default Tab that all users see when they land on their profile. Some applications that a celebrity or public entity has added to their profile are featured on the Boxes Tab. News Feed – Users will receive updates in News Feed from public profiles just like how they receive updates from their friends and family. Every time users visit Facebook, they’ll see the latest content from their friends, celebrities, and others they care about."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2008/07/facebook-unveils-next-evolution-of-site-design/","date":"2008-07-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Facebook Unveils Next Evolution of Site Design","text":"PALO ALTO, Calif. — July 20, 2008 — Facebook® today released a new, cleaner and simpler design, along with the opportunity for users to preview and test the next-generation features and functionality. The company is inviting people to use the new design and try out the improved features by navigating back and forth between the new and current versions of the site. Access to the new design will be limited at first and gradually become available to all of Facebook’s more than 80 million users over the coming days. “We’ve made the changes rolling out today in order to highlight the most recent and relevant information that users value, give users even more control and ownership over their profiles and simplify the user experience,” said Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “Facebook’s new design makes it a lot easier for users to share information, and we encourage them to check it out.” The company has been developing the new design since early this year. Over the past six months, more than 100,000 Facebook users offered constructive suggestions on the layout and features, many of which were included in the final version. The Power of Feeds Facebook uses feeds to deliver people news and information in a social context. The evolution of the site design focuses on integrating powerful feed technology and the Wall, a forum for users and their friends to post comments, photos, videos and more, including content from third-party applications. The Wall now surfaces more current and pertinent information, or “stories”, about a user and their friends’ on Facebook. New Types of “Stories” Users have complete control over the stories published on their profile. They also have the ability to adjust the size and prominence of stories and can choose between having one-line stories, short or full stories. One-line stories are one sentence long, while short stories include thumbnail photos or content, and full stories display large, noticeable images. Publish More Content Located on the Wall tab, the Publisher feature enables users to create more content than ever and in a centralized place. From the Publisher, a user can add photos, upload video, or write notes, rather than navigating to each individual application. Similarly, users can add content to their friends’ profiles through the Publisher on their profiles. Easier Site Navigation with Tabs The top menu is similar to the old design and allows users to access their Profile, Friends, and Inbox. The left hand applications menu has been moved to the ‘Applications’ link on the top of the menu screen. The Profile is now split out into tabs: • The Wall tab displays the most recent and relevant information both about the user and by the user; • The Info tab shows information about the user that doesn’t change frequently; • The Photos tab shows photos of the user as well as their albums; • The Boxes tab features all of a user’s existing application boxes. Users are also able to add individual tabs for their favorite applications. This gives users greater control over their own profiles and makes navigation faster and easier. Applications and the New Design Third-party applications are more tightly integrated into Facebook in order to make using applications simpler and more seamless. Users will have the option to interact with an application before adding it, grant it access to their information, and decide where they want it placed, if at all, on their profiles. Privacy Controls On Facebook, users choose what information they put in their profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups they join. And they control the users with whom they share that information through the privacy settings on the Privacy page of their profile. The new design does not change any of the privacy settings previously selected by the user. The new Facebook design will be made available to users at http://www.new.facebook.com. In the coming weeks, all Facebook users will automatically default to the new site design when logging in at http://www.facebook.com."},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2008/04/announcement-facebook-launches-facebook-chat/","date":"2008-04-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Announcement: Facebook Launches Facebook Chat","text":"This week, Facebook is rolling out Facebook Chat, a new way for users to communicate with their friends in real-time.

Today, we’re going to end that,” Zuckerberg told an audience of more than 750 developers and partners. “With this evolution of Facebook Platform, any developer worldwide can build full social applications on top of the social graph, inside of Facebook.” The keynote opened the Facebook f8 event, named to reflect the developer hackathon that ends 8 hours after the address during which new applications will be created for Facebook. Today, Facebook Platform launched with more than 65 developer partners and 85 applications and with the introduction of an example application called Video. Video allows for the simple sharing of personal videos between friends within Facebook, as well as the creation and sending of video messages directly to and from the Facebook Inbox. To allow users to better share the increasing amount of video being shot from mobile devices, Video supports mobile uploading of video directly into the application. Deep Integration Into Facebook Website Zuckerberg detailed how any developer can build an application that is as integrated into the site’s information flow and connections of relationships as Facebook’s own applications. Facebook users decide which applications to add and can control their order and appearance within their profiles, all with the familiar Facebook design. Users can always remove applications, including those built by Facebook, and will have their granular privacy controls maintained across applications. Facebook introduced a new markup language, Facebook Markup, which along with its previously released APIs allows developers to build applications fully integrated into the site. Facebook Markup includes features, such as dynamic information tags, conditional privacy tags, image caching and Flash. Developers can build anything they want in full, unlimited application pages on Facebook, called the “canvas pages,” and applications also can have a box in users’ profiles and navigation. Mass Distribution through the Social Graph Applications will gain distribution through what Zuckerberg called the “social graph,” the network of real connections through which people communicate and share information. Facebook and all social networks have two core elements: the social graph and the applications that run on it. Because of the efficient spreading of information through the social graph, existing Facebook applications, such as Photos, have grown to leaders in their categories. “The social graph is the changing the way the world works,” Zuckerberg said. “We are at a time in history when more information is available and people are more connected than they ever have been before, and the social graph is at the center of that.” As with existing applications on Facebook, new third-party applications will be able to notify users about relevant information through News Feed and profile Mini Feeds, helping to spur mass distribution. For example, a friend adding an application could lead to a notification in a user’s News Feed. Within profiles, applications will have an “Add” button so any user can easily install the application for themselves. “The social graph is our base, and we’ve built a framework that is completely optimized for developing social applications within our environment,” Zuckerberg added. “We believe that there is more value for everyone in letting other people develop applications on top of the base we’ve built than we could ever possibly provide on our own.” New Business Opportunity As users benefit from new choices in the applications available through Facebook, developers can build their business at the same time. Applications within profiles will remain free of advertising, but Facebook is allowing developers to make money within their canvas pages, through advertising, or transactions that they control. “This is good for us because if developers build great applications then they’re providing a service to our users and strengthening the social graph,” Zuckerberg said. “This is a big opportunity. We provide the integration and distribution and developers provide the applications. We help users share more information and together we benefit.”"},{"platform":"Facebook","url":"https://about.fb.com/news/2007/05/facebook-platform-launches-with-65-developer-partners-and-over-85-applications-for-facebook/","date":"2007-05-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company News","Facebook","Product News"],"title":"Facebook Platform Launches with 65 Developer Partners and Over 85 Applications for Facebook","text":"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook f8 Event, May 24, 2007 — Facebook, the Internet’s leading social utility, today announced more than 65 developer partners have built applications on Facebook Platform, a new development platform that enables companies and engineers to integrate with the Facebook website and gain access to millions of users. Executives from Amazon.com, Microsoft and Slide joined Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to introduce their applications onstage at “f8,” an event hosted by Facebook for more than 750 developers and industry leaders. Facebook users communicate and share information through the social graph, the network of connections and relationships between people. More than 50 percent of Facebook users return to the site each day, providing unparalleled distribution potential for applications and the opportunity to build a business that is highly relevant to people’s lives. Facebook and Amazon.com teamed up to develop an application called “Book Reviews” that lets Facebook users write and display book reviews on their profile pages. Facebook users can then click on the “Buy at Amazon” button to go to Amazon.com and complete their purchase. Facebook and Amazon.com built this application using the Amazon E- Commerce Service that enables Amazon Associates to incorporate Amazon.com product data and shopping technology into their applications and in turn, help more people discover Amazon.com’s selection. The Amazon E-commerce Service is available from Amazon Web Services. Amazon.com and Facebook are working on additional applications that let Facebook users share and discover more products they love from Amazon.com. “Amazon.com is pleased to be working with Facebook to develop exciting new applications using the Amazon E-Commerce Service from Amazon Web Services,” said Russ Grandinetti, vice president, Amazon.com. “With the Book Reviews application that will be released this week, Facebook users will be able to review, share and discover books they love with their friends, making their experience using Facebook more interesting and interactive. We’re looking forward to working with Facebook to build many new and exciting applications for their users.” Microsoft’s Popfly is a web-based tool that gives Facebook users the power to create applications and add them to their profiles with no programming at all. For instance, users can create and embed mashups of websites directly in their profiles. “The partnership between Microsoft and Facebook opens up exciting new opportunities that allow anyone to build dynamic, interactive applications using the Facebook social graph,” said Dan’l Lewin, corporate vice president, Strategic and Emerging Business Development, Microsoft Corp. “Microsoft has long been committed to empowering developers of all levels. Popfly and Visual Studio Express enable a broad new audience to experience the power of development.” Slide has tailored its most popular applications to be integrated into Facebook users’ profiles. These include Slide Shows for publishing and viewing personal photo slideshows; Slide SkinFlix for personalizing video clips with skins and themes; Slide Guestbook, an application for friends to contribute their own photos, videos and more. “Facebook’s f8 platform is a fundamental development in social computing,” said Max Levchin, founder and CEO, Slide. “Opening Facebook’s vibrant social fabric to third-party applications creates enormous product opportunities for developers of every size, from an industry leader like Slide to a college student with a few hours to spare. Facebook becomes an operating system for the people, built by the people.” Other developer partners which have built applications on Facebook Platform include: 30 Boxes; All Widgets, LLC; Amazon.com; Attendio; Bitnik; Blue Nile; Box.net; Bunchball; Channels.com; Chumby Industries; CollegeHumor; Digg, Dogster Inc.; EF Tours; Ether; Fantasy Moguls; FASHION FOR THE PEOPLE; FeedBurner, Inc.; Fliptrack, Inc.; Forbes.com; FORD MODELS; Glimpse.com; HOT or NOT; iLike, inc; Jangl; Jaxtr; Jobster; Lending Club; LocalPlatform LLC; Microsoft Corp.; MOG; Mosoto; Obama for America; Oodle; Photobucket, Inc.; Photojojo; Pickspal; Platial; Plum; Project Agape; Prosper.com; QOOP, Inc.; Radar; Rapleaf; Red Bull Energy Drink; RockYou!; Rupture; Scrapblog; Scribd; SideStep, Inc.; Slide; Snapvine, Inc.; SplashCast, Inc.; TERRALEVER; Twitter, Inc.; Uber; uPlayMe; Veoh Networks, Inc.; viagogo; VIRGIN MOBILE USA; Warner Bros.
