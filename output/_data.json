What’s more, r/electricvehicles started in 2009 and r/smarthome in 2013, many years before either of the technologies became mainstream, so there’s no denying that Reddit users have long pointed us to what’s coming next. Understanding how consumers are thinking about the products and services of tomorrow is key to unlocking marketing success today, and that’s exactly what we’ll be unveiling at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) next year as part of our very first activation at the event.",

Our platform offers a space for families to create and enjoy authentic moments, and we are committed to fostering important conversations that allow this enjoyment to take place safely and responsibly.We understand that each family is different, with diverse needs and practices. That's why we partnered with ConnectSafely to survey US parents to better understand how they approach discussions about online safety with their teens. The results show that parents recognize how important these conversations are, which is why TikTok is launching initiatives to equip and empower parents to support these critical conversations with their teens.",

    "description": "TikTok is an entertainment platform where people come to share their stories, and understand other people's experiences, too. Those stories can touch on all aspects of their lives, including current events like elections and political issues. As we have set out before, we want to continue to develop policies that foster and promote a positive environment that brings people together, not divide them. We do that currently by working to keep harmful misinformation off the platform, prohibiting political advertising, and connecting our community with authoritative information about elections. Today, we are building on that approach by making a series of changes to government, politician, and political party accounts that we believe will help ensure TikTok remains a fun, positive and joyful experience.

That's why we're announcing a number of steps today to help support our community's digital well-being as they create and discover on TikTok.As we encourage people to think more mindfully about developing positive digital habits, we're launching two new practical tools to make it easier for our community to feel in control of their TikTok experience. We already offer daily screen time limits, which help people decide how much time they'd like to spend on our app each day. In the coming weeks, we're introducing a tool to let people control how much time they spend on TikTok in a single sitting by enabling regular screen time breaks. These prompts will remind people to take a break after a certain amount of uninterrupted screen time, which they can set as they choose.",

We're thrilled to have two creator hosts and pop culture experts, Emily Uribe (@emilyuuribe) and Juju Green (@straw_hat_goofy), on the red carpet at the iconic Dolby Theatre in Hollywood for the 94th Oscars!",

Since its December 24th release, Encanto videos have pervaded TikTok, resulting in five different songs from the movie trending on the platform. Composer and genius Lin-Manuel Miranda's songs have a history of resonating with countless listeners as hits from Hamilton and In the Heights spark trends and inspire creators to express themselves. The engrossing songs of Encanto are no different. In light of this success, Lin-Manuel Miranda gave a special thanks to the TikTok community for their support, creativity, and love for the Encanto soundtrack.",

Our ads generate tens of gigabytes of event data per hour. Allowing advertisers to query across the last six months of data means that we have hundreds of billions of raw events to sift through.

For those who live in climates where the leaves change into a rainbow of well, autumn colors, people are inspired by the peak fall season to bob for apples, put pumpkin in their lattes, and watch the leaves fall. Creators on TikTok have brought the natural sights of the season onto the platform, showing the community what fall looks like in their neck of the woods. By watching others jump into leaf piles, drink pumpkin things, and wear scarves, everyone can enjoy the season, no matter where they live.",

TikTok is known for offering musicians and artists a chance to show their talents and collaborate with one another through the duet feature. When one creator makes a video showcasing a unique song they've written, it's common for other artists to add their own twist or harmony to bring the piece to a new level. This ability to build on art is one of the reasons content on TikTok is unique, engaging and diverse. The musical theater community has stepped into center stage with this format by creating elaborate, multi-part harmonies that are good enough for Broadway - or at least Broadway stars.",

    "description": "What if I told you that you could exponentially advance the trajectory of your career by applying one specific principle to how you approach projects at work? It sounds far fetched, but for me, it worked. The principle is called The Matthew Effect, which states “Those who already have status are often placed in situations where they gain more, and those that do not have status typically struggle to achieve more.” I stumbled across this principle two years ago, completely by accident, after picking up a side project to reduce the massive clutter we were seeing in our error logging. My project reduced our error logging by ~96% (removing a total of 149 million log lines per day) and suddenly, people were paying attention to my work. As the principle states, once you are recognized, all of your future work is more likely to get recognized. I started getting invited to new, important meetings. My opinion suddenly seemed to matter more. I was placed in the ‘Top Performers’ tier and won an internal award from our CTO. I became tech lead for a new team and was ultimately promoted to a manager position, all within a year of completing this project. & maybe the most important metric of them all, my salary since my project launched has increased by 40%. I am confident that without (accidentally) creating my own Matthew Effect, it would have taken much longer for my career to reach this point.",

    "description": "June 19 – celebrated as Juneteenth (a portmanteau of “June” and “nineteenth”) – is a day of recognition. For African Americans, it marks the day in which the United States ceased its barbaric practice of legalized slavery. Sadly, this was two years after the Emancipation Proclamation had already granted that very same freedom to African Americans in January of 1863. As with most holidays, June 19, 1865 marked a pivotal moment in history: the day the last group of African Americans in Texas were notified they were no longer in bondage, effectively ending slavery in the United States.",

At TikTok, we've been celebrating our AAPI creators, including by highlighting creators under the #AAPIFamily hashtag. We're now hosting a week-long virtual event to honor our incredible, diverse group of creators, which kicks off today!",

In fact, research has shown that push notifications can result in people visiting an app 88% more frequently and users that opt in to push notifications come back to the app at nearly twice the rate of those who don’t. Additionally, research has indicated that about 50% of mobile app users find push notifications helpful, so we also had a chance to help even hardcore users use Reddit more easily. Push notifications, if used correctly, can have multiple benefits for users: they help notify users of relevant content, allow users to benefit from Reddit without needing to open the app, and enable users to discover new ways in which to engage with their communities..",

While we’ve always seen TikTok as a place for everyone, we understand the concerns that arise around younger users. In working with the FTC and in conjunction with today’s agreement, we’ve now implemented changes to accommodate younger US users in a limited, separate app experience that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for this audience.",

    "description": "Voting is embedded in the Reddit experience. Yet offline, 1 in 4 eligible US voters isn’t registered. Even the most civically-conscious among us can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed, especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US. For example, did you know that you have to update your voter registration if you move, even if it’s just across town? Or that you also need to update it if you’ve changed your name (say, due to a change in marital status)? Depending on your state, you may even need to re-register if you simply haven’t voted in a while, even if you’ve stayed at the same address.",

But as more industries turn to big data, the national shortage has grown to 151,717 people, based on employer hiring demand. The U.S. cities with particularly acute shortages are New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles.",

A university degree was a meal ticket to a high-paying, secure job as a professional. & for workers with a high school diploma, jobs on manufacturing assembly lines offered a pathway to middle-class prosperity and upward mobility. While this was not necessarily the reality everywhere, it was the model that set expectations for what a career was supposed to look like.",

In fact, many connections are already taking place every day, whether it's someone placing an order with a local bakery or looking at new styles from a clothing store. But the way this happens now on WhatsApp is pretty rudimentary. We've heard stories of shopkeepers who use WhatsApp to stay in touch with hundreds of customers from a single smartphone, and from people who are unsure about whether or not a business on WhatsApp is authentic. In the coming months, we'll be testing new features that aim to solve some of these challenges, and make it easier for people to communicate with the businesses they want to reach on WhatsApp. Our approach is simple – we want to apply what we've learned helping people connect with each other to helping people connect with businesses that are important to them.",

If they aren’t there, you can quickly send an audio note to say what you mean. & sometimes, a sticker says it best :)",

The transcript with prepared remarks is contained within this press release. In addition, a supplemental presentation will be made available on the investor relations section of the LinkedIn website at http://investors.linkedin.com.  “Q4 was a strong quarter for LinkedIn, bringing to a close a successful year of growth and innovation against our long-term roadmap,” said Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn. “We enter 2016 with increased focus on core initiatives that will drive leverage across our portfolio of products.”  During the quarter, LinkedIn made solid progress against its long-term product strategy to create value for members by connecting them to opportunity. We launched our reimagined flagship app in December, created a more streamlined experience for members to follow personalized and relevant content in the feed, and continued to scale the number of jobs on the platform to now more than six million open listings.  Revenue increased 34% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $862 million and increased 35% in 2015 to $2,991 million.",

We should put the phone down and just experience life rather than worry ourselves with its documentation. This sentiment wrongly assumes that documentation and experience are essentially at odds, a conceptual remnant of how we used to think of photography, as an art object, as content, rather than what it is often today, less an object and more a sharing of experience. But not all social media are built the same, and I think we can use a distinction in social platforms: those that are based in social media versus those that are more fundamentally about communication.",

    "description": "LONDON, Sept. 12, 2013 - LinkedIn, the world’s largest online professional network, announced today LinkedIn Bring In Your Parents Day, a worldwide event taking place Thursday, November 7, 2013. LinkedIn encourages professionals to invite their parents into their workplace to provide them with a first-hand look and greater understanding of what they actually do every day. Parents can be a valuable part of a professional’s network, having faced challenges and important career lessons along the way. However, one in three parents admit they are unfamiliar with what their child does for a living and so may find it challenging to provide the right advice to support their child's success. LinkedIn Bring in Your Parents Day is a way to help bridge this gap by bringing parents and their children together in the workplace, so they can learn from each other.",

    "description": "Jakarta, Indonesia – February 21, 2012 – LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network with more than 150 million members worldwide and over 25 million members in Asia Pacific, today announced it has surpassed the one million professional member milestone in Indonesia.   Today’s announcement follows the launch of LinkedIn´s Bahasa Indonesia language offering in December 2011, which is part of LinkedIn’s ongoing commitment to improving the user experience so that all professionals globally can leverage LinkedIn for their career advancement. Since the launch of the local language site, the number of LinkedIn Groups in Bahasa Indonesia has doubled to over 700 groups.   “Indonesia is an important market for us where we see a huge potential for growth. Two months after the launch of the local language site, this is a significant milestone for us that demonstrates that professionals in Indonesia are interested in building their online brand on LinkedIn,” said Clifford Rosenberg, Managing Director of LinkedIn Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia.  Over one million Indonesian professionals on LinkedIn are benefiting from the network to manage their professional identities, connect with trusted contacts, gain professional insights from the community and find new career or business opportunities.   With new members signing up at a rate that is faster than two new members per second globally, LinkedIn’s global reach and scale enables professionals in Indonesia to find and connect with business contacts and showcase their skills to global audiences.  Below are some interesting statistics about LinkedIn’s membership in Indonesia:  The top three largest industry sectors with the fastest growing LinkedIn membership are:",

In his expanded role, Scott will continue to direct key engineering efforts to accelerate innovation and deployment of new services for LinkedIn members. Scott will report directly to LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner.  Scott joined LinkedIn in February 2011 as vice president of engineering. In this role, he was instrumental in expanding and enhancing LinkedIn's rapidly growing software infrastructure, and he led far-reaching engineering initiatives to increase the value LinkedIn delivers to its members.   Scott's 20-year career in technology spans both academia and industry as researcher, engineer, strategist and leader. Scott joined LinkedIn in February 2011 from Google, where he led mobile ads engineering. Prior to this, he ran engineering and operations at AdMob, the world's leading platform for mobile monetization, and was instrumental in the integration efforts following the $750 million acquisition of AdMob by Google in 2010. Previously, Scott held numerous leadership positions at Google in search and ads engineering.   \"Kevin is one of the brightest minds and best leaders in the software engineering industry, and we are fortunate to have him at LinkedIn,\" said Weiner. \"In his time at LinkedIn, Kevin's built a world-class engineering team; delivered the ability to create great products our members love; and spearheaded the effort to re-architect our software development and deployment process, which is now the foundation for our accelerated product innovation plan going forward.\"   Among numerous honors, Kevin has received a Google Founder's Award, an Intel Ph.D. Fellowship, and an ACM Recognition of Service award. He was a founding member of the ACM Professions Board and sits on the technical advisory boards for a number of startups.",

The over 3 million current members in the Netherlands and all new members who join LinkedIn in the future can now select the Dutch language version right from their homepage.   LinkedIn has a growing, highly-engaged membership base in the Netherlands and the addition of a local language version will allow members to communicate, collaborate and share information more easily with their trusted professional contacts and all in their native language.   \"LinkedIn has a tremendous opportunity for growth in the Netherlands,\" said Lot Keijzer, Director LinkedIn BeNeLux. \"The Netherlands is the most active LinkedIn country in Europe with the highest level of participation, and we are looking forward to seeing the effects that having the site available in Dutch will bring. From our experience in other countries, local language availability deepens levels of engagement for our members, who greatly benefit from being able to communicate, collaborate and share information in their native language.\"   The addition of Dutch follows Swedish, Russian, Romanian and Turkish language versions introduced in 2011 and reflects the continued investment that LinkedIn is making in the European market. In addition to Dutch, LinkedIn is available in: English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.",

The São Paulo office will serve as regional headquarters to nearly 14 million LinkedIn members across Latin America, providing support for growth and development in the region.   LinkedIn also announced the appointment of Osvaldo Barbosa de Oliveira as country manager of LinkedIn Brazil. He will lead efforts to increase awareness and adoption of LinkedIn in Brazil with a focus on user engagement, strategic partnerships, marketing, sales and general operations. Oliveira will also continue to help grow LinkedIn’s three lines of business – member subscriptions, marketing solutions and hiring solutions – in Brazil.   Oliveira joins LinkedIn with 30 years of experience in the Internet and technology sectors. He was with Microsoft for 21 years in Brazil and the U.S. and led the development of Microsoft’s online business in Brazil and managed end-user product marketing for Windows 7 and Windows Phone. His experience also includes serving as president of the Brazilian branch of the Interactive Advertising Bureau in 2007.   “There is a huge opportunity in Brazil for LinkedIn’s growth, and I’m excited to oversee the opening of our first office and the establishment of a local team,” said Oliveira. “This is a great first step in the expansion of our presence in Latin America, as I’m looking forward to helping Brazilian professionals become more productive and successful on LinkedIn.”  “Having a presence in Latin America is vital for LinkedIn as we want to provide relevant, local support for our growing member and customer base. Osvaldo brings an incredible depth of knowledge in the online sector and an intimate knowledge of the Brazilian market which will help to guide our growth in the region,” said Mike Gamson, SVP of global sales at LinkedIn.   Since the launch of a Portuguese-language version in April 2010, LinkedIn’s membership in Brazil has grown six-fold to more than six million professionals. LinkedIn has nearly 14 million members across Latin America including members in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

    "description": "Las Vegas — October 18, 2011 — LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network with more than 120 million members, today announced LinkedIn Talent Pipeline, a new solution for recruiters which will give them the ability to more easily manage all of their talent leads in one place, helping them recruit the best talent more quickly. The announcement was made onstage by LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner in front of more than 1,800 recruiting professionals at the company’s Talent Connect customer event in Las Vegas, Nevada.  With the rise of social media, recruiters are dealing with an increase in online networks as sources of talent who may not be actively seeking a new job. This is in addition to more traditional sources such as personal referrals, conferences, job boards and company career sites. This shift toward recruiting ‘passive’ talent gives recruiters access to a much larger pool of potential candidates with the right skills and experience than if they relied on active candidates alone. Talent Pipeline will allow recruiters to keep track of all of these potential candidates in one place, even before they enter the formal application process.  Speaking on the announcement, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner commented, “Recruiters are actively looking for more talent from more sources and managing all their talent leads across multiple tools. With LinkedIn Talent Pipeline, we’re extending our Recruiter platform and continuing our focus to connect talent with opportunity on a massive scale by providing a single place to manage and update these leads, wherever they are found.”  Because most passive candidates have not formally applied for a job, they are not tracked in a company’s Applicant Tracking System (ATS). As a result, many recruiters are simply tracking leads in their own spreadsheets - a tool designed for crunching numbers, not tracking, nurturing and collaborating on recruitment.   James Holincheck, Managing Vice President of Human Capital Management at Gartner commented, “One of the most frequent things we hear from enterprises today is a desire to better manage the increasing number of talent sources. Recruiters know that passive candidates are an important source of talent and want better tools to capture this opportunity.”   Today, companies that try to create a separate database for leads spend significant time and effort to implement a new system and process, only to find they haven’t solved the problem of stale information. The moment someone changes a title, job or location, the original lead or resume is out-of-date and the database becomes less valuable. LinkedIn Talent Pipeline solves this problem:",

    "description": "Mountain View, Calif.–July 25, 2011–LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), the world's largest professional network on the Internet, today announced a new plugin that enables job seekers to easily submit their LinkedIn profile for job opportunities on an employer’s website.  “In this challenging jobs environment, LinkedIn's ability to connect talent with opportunity at massive scale is more essential than ever. Apply with LinkedIn is the next phase of our open platform effort and we hope an important catalyst in creating economic opportunity for our members,” said Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn.   By clicking the new Apply with LinkedIn button on a company’s website, consumers and companies alike will be able to find more opportunities, candidates and insights that will ultimately help them land them their dream job or dream candidate.   “Apply with LinkedIn provides an easy way for job seekers to put their best foot forward when applying for new opportunities and demonstrates a confidence in their professional identity and brand which showcases their acquired skills, experiences and professional connections,” said Deep Nishar, SVP of products and user experience at LinkedIn. “Companies also gain access to one of the most qualified and coveted talent pools of more than 100 million LinkedIn professionals around the world.”  For Job Applicants When job applicants click the Apply with LinkedIn button, they will have the opportunity to edit their profile before submitting or they can go directly to the one-click “Submit Application” button, which will automatically send the candidate’s public LinkedIn profile data to the employer or pre-populate the employer's online employment application. Applicants receive immediate confirmation of their submission and will be prompted with professional connections that they can contact to increase their chances of getting hired at the company. Job candidates will also be able to manage any job submissions using the Apply with LinkedIn button when they go to their LinkedIn.com “Saved Jobs” tab to allow for added efficiency and organization in their job search.  For Companies Thousands of companies have the Apply with LinkedIn plugin accessible on their websites today, including LinkedIn, Netflix, LivingSocial, Photobucket, Concur subsidiary TripIt, Foodspotting, GazeHawk, Munch On Me, and Formative Labs. LinkedIn has also teamed up with key Applicant Tracking System (ATS) partners who have enabled the Apply with LinkedIn plugin for their customers today, including Peoplefluent, Jobvite, SmartRecruiters, Bullhorn, and Jobscience. By integrating Apply with LinkedIn as an additional option for job candidates, the corporate world’s most active employers can increase the quality of their applicant flow and their ability to identify and qualify high-quality candidates. In addition, Taleo, Lumesse, and Kenexa have announced that they will implement the Apply with LinkedIn technology by the end of the year. Companies will have the option to customize the plugin and will be able to add up to three questions for the applicant to complete, such as a candidate’s willingness to relocate, option to add a cover letter, or customized questions. The plugin can be tailored to a company’s existing applicant tracking service and may offer varying features based on their ATS partner. Companies interested in integrating Apply with LinkedIn can download the free plugin on apply.linkedin.com.",

This latest expansion follows the opening of LinkedIn’s Paris office in March and Singapore in May, and brings the number of LinkedIn offices in Europe up to five, including London, Dublin and Amsterdam.   Ariel Eckstein, managing director of LinkedIn EMEA, will oversee the expansion of the team in Stockholm as part of his role in driving the company’s diverse business model comprised of hiring solutions, marketing solutions and member subscriptions. In the near-term, this will include a focus on member engagement, marketing, and developing customer relationships.  Commenting on the announcement, Eckstein said, “There are nearly 25 million European professionals now establishing their professional identities, building their networks and gaining access to insights and opportunities on LinkedIn. As such, we’re growing our presence to offer better support both for the members, as well as our growing customer base. The Nordics are some of the most penetrated markets worldwide in terms of Internet use, and this is reflected in their adoption of professional networking online. Our members in the region are both engaged locally and well-connected globally.”  Founded in 2003, LinkedIn is now the world’s largest professional network with more than half of its members based outside of the U.S. Roughly one million new members join LinkedIn every week, equivalent to more than one joining every second. Recent product innovations, such as LinkedIn Today and Signal, help professionals filter the growing amount of daily information and news to help them make better business decisions.   Brands such as FinAir, Statoil and Visit Denmark use LinkedIn’s Marketing Solution products to connect their products and services with LinkedIn audience of educated, affluent and influential professionals. Employers including Scania, Electrolux and Swedbank are using LinkedIn’s Hiring Solutions tools to identify and recruit top talent in Europe and further afield.   Notes to editors Top three companies in Sweden by LinkedIn membership: • Ericsson • Logica • Sony-Ericsson  Top three companies in Denmark: • Novo Nordisk • Danske Bank • IBM  Top three companies in Finland: • Nokia • Tieto • Elisa  Top three companies in Norway:  • Statoil • Aker Solutions • NTNU  Top three industries in Sweden by LinkedIn members: • IT and Services • Telecommunications • Computer software  Top three industries in Denmark: • IT & Services • Government administration  • Computer Software  Top three industries in Norway: • Oil and energy • IT & Services • Computer software  Top three industries in Finland: • IT & Services • Telecommunications • Research  Top Nordic-based companies based on growing presence on LinkedIn: 1.

    "description": "Singapore – May 31, 2011 – LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), the world’s largest professional network with more than 100 million members worldwide, today announced that it is opening the company’s Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. The Singapore office will serve as the regional headquarters to more than 18 million LinkedIn members in Asia Pacific and Japan. Supporting existing markets in Australia and India, the Singapore headquarters will also be used as a launch pad for further regional expansion. The company’s office in Japan is set to open later this year.   Arvind Rajan, Managing Director and Vice-President, Asia Pacific and Japan, will be responsible for driving the company’s diverse business model comprised of recruitment licensing solutions, advertising sales and member subscriptions. In the near-term, this will include a focus on membership engagement, sales and marketing, and strategic regional partnerships.   Commenting on the announcement, Rajan said, “LinkedIn is a truly global network. We understand that to be a worldwide network for professionals, you need to be local and relevant to them at home. Singapore is a hub for talent, and we are establishing our regional headquarters here to serve as a gateway to the rest of the region, to enhance local market understanding, and to develop further strategic relationships.”   With more than 4,000 multinational companies headquartered in Singapore, including more than one-third of Fortune 500 corporations, Singapore’s skilled talent base and strong government support, is well-positioned with LinkedIn’s aim of connecting talent with opportunity. Seventy-three of the Fortune 100 companies around the world use LinkedIn for talent acquisition.  Recruiters rely on LinkedIn’s large talent pool to find ‘passive’ candidates - highly skilled professionals who are currently employed. These passive candidates may not be actively seeking a new job opportunity but might be the best suited for key roles. At the same time, professionals in Asia Pacific are recognising the growing importance of their online personal brand in the changing social media landscape. comScore reports that LinkedIn visitors from Asia Pacific increased by 132 percent from March 2010 to March 2011.  “These are exciting times for LinkedIn. Our membership across Asia Pacific is being driven by professionals using LinkedIn to network, build their online brand, gain insights from the community and find new career or business opportunities,\" said Rajan. \"We intend to focus our efforts on delivering the best product experience for our members in their careers, the brand marketers who want to reach them, and the recruiters who are looking to hire the best talent,” he added.",
