While we share the overall goal of helping to build people's trust in the political ads they see online, we’re concerned that the law could go far beyond what many people would consider as a political ad. In fact, it could end up covering a wide range of political speech and content online - even videos from people just expressing their opinions without payment or sponsorship. Whether this happens depends on a choice facing EU policymakers about how to define a “political ad” in the new law. The wide definition on the table could include any video that touches on societal issues and debate — from commentary on the energy crisis, human rights, to a discussion of the economy.Once defined as a “political ad”, platforms like YouTube could then be limited in the use of recommendations to connect audiences to this content. Recommendations are the main way that we help our viewers discover relevant videos they may find useful or informative from the vast repository of content on YouTube.We believe that the new rules on political advertising should only apply to paid-for political content and ads, rather than potentially all political content online. Changing how people find and connect to helpful political content would impact both viewers and creators: A broad definition of political ads could ... make it harder for campaigns to find and recruit the next generation of NGO activists. A diverse range of perspectives could be much harder to findWith over 500 hours of content uploaded on YouTube every minute, recommendations play a critical role in helping people discover content that is relevant to them. For creators, recommendations offer a chance to be discovered, build an audience, and mean that new voices and perspectives can break through. Effectively removing political content from recommendations could make it harder for a range of voices to be heard.A barrier between NGOs and the next generation of activistsYouTube is a place where many people come to learn about the issues they care about, find community, and get involved in civil society. Campaigners on a wide range of issues, from climate change to LGBTQ+ rights, rely on the global platform they have through YouTube, to bring their cause to the largest viewing audience in the world. A broad definition of political ads could capture most NGO content, remove it from recommendations, and make it harder for campaigns to find and recruit the next generation of activists. YouTube’s mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. When it comes to political issues, especially around election time, this means connecting people with high quality information, dealing with harmful content, and helping a diverse range of voices to be heard.As this critical discussion continues, we’ll keep engaging with policymakers, creators, and partners on the details, while building on our own efforts to provide a platform for healthy political debate."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/empowering-viewers-of-all-ages-to-safer-internet","date":"2023-02-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Learning & Education","Events","YouTube Kids","News & Events"],"title":"4 ways we’re empowering viewers of all ages to experience a safer internet","text":"There’s no arguing that time spent online is an ever-increasing part of our lives, from how we communicate with friends and family to where we learn and find entertainment. And because a lot of that happens right here on YouTube, it’s our commitment to invest in the products, built-in protections and easy-to-use tools to make being online safer for people of all ages.In honor of Safer Internet Day, here are the latest tips that empower you to manage your YouTube experience — from mindfulness customizations and data privacy protections to controls and resources for families.* Video format not supported 1) Be more mindful of the way you spend time online with digital wellbeing toolsWe’re all trying to be more thoughtful of how we spend our time online, and over the last few years, we’ve introduced a suite of tools to help you manage your time on YouTube, like bedtime reminders, time watched and controls to tailor autoplay settings. Safer Internet Day is a great reminder to check your settings and make sure they’re still working for you.We’re getting families involved, too – we’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. Video format not supported 2) Review and manage your data on a regular basisLooking at your YouTube data regularly helps protect your privacy and gives you more control over your viewing experience. YouTube makes it easy for you to access your data through the “Your Data in YouTube'' page. There you’ll find a summary of your content and activity data, along with settings and controls to manage your data, and information on how it’s used to improve your YouTube experience.You can browse or delete your YouTube activity - including comments you’ve made on videos and channels you’ve subscribed to – and review your watch and search history, which helps improve your recommendations in YouTube and other Google services. 3) Extend protections for kids and tweens by signing into YouTube Kids and YouTube on eligible devicesEvery family’s relationship with media and technology is different. For parents and caregivers, we offer options to help them decide what’s best for their kids and are investing in new ways to improve these experiences. Signing in to YouTube Kids and YouTube on eligible devices is a quick tip to help YouTube work better for families. Here’s why:YouTube Kids gives signed-in parents all the controls to customize the experience to the specific needs of their youngest kids. They can make a profile for each child with individual settings, block content or approve specific channels and videos, and even decide to share content from YouTube directly with their child in YouTube Kids.Our supervised experience on YouTube works well for families with tweens who have their own mobile device, or want their own account. We spent the last year expanding support for these supervised accounts so that tweens can sign in to YouTube on gaming consoles, smart TVs, the YouTube Music app and more. This helps us respect a parent's choice of content setting across devices in the home where their tween watches videos or listens to music. 4) Get tips & connect with kids about online safety with our special YouTube Kids playlistToday’s kids will be lifelong users of technology, and ongoing education is important for their safety and long-term success. That’s why today, we launched our YouTube Kids playlist, 'Build a Safer Internet,' which you may see upon opening the YouTube Kids app. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips, songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world.

They’re checking out highlights from playoff games, brushing up on Rihanna lyrics for the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, looking into recipes for the game day bash and listening to podcast predictions on who’s coming home with the Lombardi trophy. And of course, they're looking forward to the ads — which you can start watching today on AdBlitz.As with previous years, AdBlitz continues to provide viewers with a central destination to watch and share the year’s biggest ads before, during and after the game. The way we consume content continues to become more dynamic as viewers shift away from linear TV into streaming. This is most evident with the biggest moments of the year like the Super Bowl. According to comScore, last year, during Super Bowl LVI, YouTube reached 77% of adults with a Super Bowl ad vs. 72% on TV. From 2022: Amazon’s Big Game Commercial: Mind Reader This shifting landscape is not only drawing in football fans but the League itself. The NFL has been leaned into the platform for years with its owned channels and original content like NFL Game Day All Access and NFL Follies and recently, we announced our partnership with the NFL to bring Sunday Ticket to YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime channels. According to Kantar, 74% of fans who indicated they are very interested in sports visit YouTube multiple times a week.“We’re excited to bring our Super Bowl campaign back to AdBlitz again this year as the program provides us with an innovative way to reach our current and next generation of fans,” said Blake Stuchin, Vice President and Head of NFL Digital Media Business Development. “The NFL and YouTube partnership continues to grow and create new touchpoints for fans – from highlights every week of the season, to original shows like the Emmy-winning Game Day All-Access, to NFL Sunday Ticket coming exclusively to YouTube starting in the 2023 season.” From 2022: Zeus & Hera | BMW USA (Official Video) Brands who want to own the moment and extend the life of their expensive campaigns lean into YouTube through AdBlitz — which is supported through our innovative ad solutions. YouTube uniquely provides the reach and tools that drive awareness, relevance and conversions. This is why advertisers consider AdBlitz the home for their digital campaigns and an important complement to their TV campaigns..Last year, Hyundai, the automotive company, ran a month-long AdBlitz campaign in the weeks leading up to and following the Big Game, generating more than 247 million impressions. In contrast to previous years when the brand invested heavily in TV ads throughout the game itself, Hyundai found success by going digital-first during the Super Bowl.Angela Zepeda, Hyundai’s CMO, says, “The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched televised events in the world. That said, the landscape has changed. In order to connect with our audience, we need to evolve and explore different ways to ensure our brand is front and center. That’s where YouTube comes in.” From 2022: Zach Braff and Donald Faison Sing a Duet for Home Internet | T-Mobile You can watch the first teasers and commercials on the AdBlitz channel right now including the NFL’s and Hyundai’s Super Bowl in-game spots.

Every day, people around the world choose to spend time on the platform learning to improve their lives. And we want to empower learners even further by providing a direct path to formal education.We’re thrilled to share that we’ve partnered with Arizona State University (ASU) and Crash Course to create Study Hall. It’s a new approach that demystifies the college process while creating an affordable and accessible onramp to earning college credit. A postsecondary education drives economic and social mobility in powerful ways, yet the path to higher education can be riddled with barriers, including high cost and accessibility. We’re hoping to change that with Study Hall. Study Hall is slated to expand to 12 available courses by January 2025 to give learners a chance to receive credit for an entire first year of college from a top public research university at a time and place that works best for them. Starting today, students can sign up here for four “College Foundations” courses which start on March 7, 2023 and offer eligibility for transfer credit. This suite encompasses the most common first-year college courses at many higher-education institutions: English Composition, College Math, US History and Human Communication. Developed and taught by the same faculty who conduct research and teach students on ASU's campuses, the lessons combine ASU's academic excellence with Crash Courses's compelling storytelling — all on YouTube's wide-reaching platform. Anyone can get started — no applications or minimum GPAs needed.Study Hall is slated to expand to 12 available courses by January 2025. This will give learners a chance to receive credit for an entire first year of college from a top public research university at a time and place that works best for them. And they’re available to watch at no cost! There is a $25 fee if the learner elects to sign up and begin coursework, and an optional $400 fee to receive college credit for each course. Learners who register before March 7, 2023 will receive special scholarship pricing of $350 per course — less than one-third of the average course cost at a public four-year university for in-state students and nearly 90% lower than the average course cost of a private four-year university.* Each course can be taken as often as needed until the learner is satisfied with their grade. This credit can then be used at any of the hundreds of institutions that accept credits from ASU. The additional Study Hall series, “How to College,” includes videos that help learners navigate the complex college admissions process and stay on track once enrolled. Another video series “Fast Guides” gives information and insights into dozens of the most popular college majors, with helpful tips like required classes for each major and the most likely careers associated with those degrees.We are so excited to offer this new experience to help learners pursue their dreams and degrees with a learning journey that begins on YouTube.*Source: https://educationdata.org/cost-of-a-college-class-or-credit-hour lists the per hour average cost at a public four-year university for in-state students as $390 and the per hour average cost at a private four-year university as $1,492. This means the average cost of a three hour course at a public four-year university for in-state students is $1,170 and the per hour average cost at a private four-year university is $4,476. The cost of an equivalent 3 hour course through Study Hall will be $25 fee + $350 scholarship price per course through March 7, which is 32% and 8% the average cost of a 3 hour course at a public four-year university for in-state students and at a private four-year university."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-brandcast-2023-lincoln-center","date":"2023-01-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","News & Events"],"title":"The world watches YouTube: Announcing YouTube Brandcast at Lincoln Center","text":"Today, viewers want to shift seamlessly from creator-driven content to episodic TV, and from short-form to long-form.

Sometimes you want to watch highlights from the Golden Globes, or marathon Yellowstone episodes when it’s cold out.But somehow we still spend too much time scrolling through channels just to find something to watch. When we were building YouTube TV, our team spent a lot of time thinking about how we could make that experience better — we even considered not having a live guide whatsoever! But we decided we needed to meet our viewers where they are.Today, we are walking you through the latest redesigns of YouTube TV’s Live and Library. Our team’s philosophy is that YouTube TV is ‘TV Made For You’ You may have already noticed the updated live guide in your app, with new curated recommendations at the top, a simplified design and more key information for each live show or movie.We’re now starting to roll out updates to the library, which will help you manage your content with improved content filtering and better organizational tools to make your library feel less cluttered. Users should begin seeing this redesign over the next few months.We wanted to share our UX thinking behind these changes and how we kept our members and their viewing experience top of mind during the research and design process. TV made for you How our team approaches each surface on YouTube TV Our team’s philosophy is that YouTube TV is ‘TV Made For You’, and this is threaded throughout the entire product experience across your Live, Library and Home. These surfaces enable viewers to find what’s on now, browse what to watch, and go back into content they may have missed.Before even sketching out designs, the team took a step back to develop user-focused key principles that would drive the redesign of these surfaces on YouTube TV:Empower viewers with more control and choice so they can watch TV their wayAnticipate TV watching needs by getting viewers the content they want with less effortRecognize different interests and viewing behaviorsWe relied on user research from in-home interviews, app feedback, surveys and concept testing to identify and prioritize design decisions. Some insights that influenced our approach: Decision fatigue is real when you turn on your TV with even more apps and channels than ever before. Viewers are looking for easier ways to find the content most relevant to them, whether it’s jumping into a live game or seeing what’s trending right now. They also seek contextual information like show’s description, air date, episode and key characters (e.g. cast, crew, or athletes) to not only decide what to watch but also check if something is worth their time.Viewers want more control. Our members enjoy YouTube TV’s unlimited DVR, but those with larger libraries have a harder time finding exactly what to watch. Members have built up their libraries over time but programs they were interested in several years ago might no longer be relevant to them. Parents in particular offered us a key insight: they often felt like their libraries were cluttered with kids' content and they wanted a way to better see their own recordings. The more their libraries grew, the less usable they became due to the lack of tools to organize their shows, movies and sports.Every second is valuable. Viewers want to jump back into ‘most watched’ and find relevant programming airing right now without hunting for it. Everything we need to convey to them around watch progress, freshness and relevance needs to be understood at a glance. We have also learned that viewers want to easily record shows without going through multiple steps. The hypotheses and results On Live, we added more details about each program to help you quickly decide what to watch Live and Library are the most used pages by YouTube TV watchers, so we decided to focus on improving those areas through hypotheses that went through rounds of iteration:Hypothesis 1: By assisting viewers through better page organization, we can help them get into a great watch experience intuitively.To test this, we designed a new, highlighted state at the top of the live guide so users could confirm that they were watching the right program. We also made the live guide more compact, so folks could quickly take in more information at a glance, reducing the need to keep scrolling.For Library, we introduced a visual hierarchy so viewers could easily parse through all the different content that had been added. Hypothesis 2: By empowering viewers with clear actions and simple iconography, we help them make the most of their TV experience in a quick and efficient manner.For both the live guide and library, we designed side panels that offered shortcuts (e.g. “Add to Library,” with a “Set Reminder” shortcut coming soon!) without taking the user away from what they were doing.Based on user research, we also learned that the library wasn’t optimal to view at a glance. We decluttered the navigation by introducing filters and added a “Catch up on your favorites” shelf so users could easily pinpoint the newest and most relevant content for them. These changes reflect our larger mission to deliver a delightful, easy to use, and modern TV experience. Rather than focusing on a single major launch, we are working towards integrating our principles across key surfaces (Live, Library) and honing in on our critical user journeys (Collecting, Browsing, Watching). YouTube TV aims to deliver intuitive and fresh updates to our overall experience with minimal disruption to our viewers.

Started in 2019, YouTube Creator Town has been offering an opportunity for creators to bond and network with creators, fans, users and YouTube, amidst the pandemic. 유튜브 크리에이터 타운 '대운동회' 하이라이트 영상 From online to offline to hybridThe first YouTube Creator Town took place in Busan in 2019, where gaming creators gathered to attend one of the largest gaming conferences in Korea. We invited winners of the first NextUp program in Korea, a training course to empower the next generation of creators, and offered them and top gaming creators chances to network with each other, space to shoot, edit, rest and charge their devices, a livestream booth to engage with their fans and many more.A few months after our first event, the world started to shut down due to the pandemic. To continue our efforts to build the gaming creator community, we switched to an online event, where we invited creators to join us at an online exclusive community building event on Minecraft, powered by Google Cloud. In 2021, we developed this even further and hosted the Creator Town event with the theme of ‘Sports Day,’ enabling creators to team up with others, accomplish different missions and engage with their fans.This year, we were back with Creator Town: Gaming Competition, where we had three hosts, Testerhoon, Sleepground and Netmarble, to host game tournaments and to engage with gaming fans across the country. For the first time since the inaugural event, we were able to see some offline collaborations between creators, and hope to create more opportunities for fans to engage with their favorite creators in the future! 테스터훈과 미리 보는 #유크타게임대전 #장인토너먼트 #이게되네 테스터훈과 미리 보는 #유크타게임대전 #장인토너먼트 #이게되네 True multi-format experienceFor this year’s Creator Town, creators delivered content across different formats — tournament matches were live streamed, while highlights were captured in both long-form videos and Shorts.We also invited fans to join the experience by asking them to join the #ItWorks Shorts challenge. By posting Shorts with their epic game plays, fans were given chances to get tickets to the final tournament matches happening offline and also win some special gaming items and merchandise. Celebrating the ever-growing gaming content ecosystem in Korea Testerhoon hosted the League of Legends Masters Invitational Tournament at the YouTube Creator Town this year. Our first YouTube Creator Town was focused mostly on supporting creators during the gaming conference. However, after we saw the valuable interaction between fans and creators at Creator Towns during the pandemic, we wanted to expand the event so that the entire gaming community could benefit from the event.To do so, we teamed up with two gaming creators and a game developer for this year’s Creator Town. Testerhoon and Sleepground hosted tournaments and matches at the Creator Town and shared them with their fans, while Netmarble hosted a gaming tournament with their new gaming title HypeSquad, inviting creators and gaming fans for the match live streams, award ceremony and many more. Sleepground hosted the Legend Crew Match at the YouTube Creator Town this year. Hear from our hostsWe also asked our amazing hosts to share their thoughts about this year’s Creator Town.“After years of hosting master players of ‘League of Legends’ on my channel through the ‘Masters Invitational’ series, I finally had the opportunity to host a real, well-laid tournament with the support of my fans and YouTube. There were great and small issues along the way but I feel happy and fulfilled that we did it! I’ll never be able to forget how my fans came together to enjoy the final match.” — Testerhoon\"Truly a special experience to showcase the Legend Crew Match that Minecraft fans have all been waiting for at the YouTube Creator Town. I look forward to seeing more of such collaborations between game creators and fans!\" — Sleepground Netmarble hosted the HypeSquad Super League at the YouTube Creator Town this year. “It was amazing to watch the creator live streams, user live chats and so many videos created after the event and get to know what the fans love about our game ‘HypeSquad’. The award ceremony at the end was really an unforgettable experience. A huge thank you to the YouTube team, our HypeSquad team and last but not least, every single one of the creators who played with us for such a long time!” More like this Susan's 5 questions for Sleepground We’d like to thank our hosts, gaming fans, creators and the gaming community in Korea for joining and supporting the YouTube Creator Town.

They heard directly from candidates, dug into campaign issues, and stayed informed on the latest news and election results. At YouTube, our overriding goal was critical: to connect people to high-quality news and information. Now that the Georgia runoff has wrapped up, we’re giving insight into how we delivered on this critical, foundational goal. In November our Breaking News and Top News shelves surfaced more than 65 million times on the YouTube homepage Helping voters access authoritative news and informationDuring major news moments, YouTube shows content from trusted sources for viewers in prominent news shelves, and the midterms were no exception. In the month of November alone, our Breaking News and Top News shelves surfaced more than 65 million times on the YouTube homepage and at the top of search results in multiple languages, including English and Spanish. And that’s just one touchpoint. The recommendations we serve to viewers offer up another potent opportunity to raise up quality content. When people searched for news and information about the midterms, on average, more than 85% of the videos in search results came from quality news sources Leading up to and following election day, our recommendation system prominently recommended content from trusted national and local news sources across multiple languages, including English and Spanish. Over 85% of recommendations on midterms-related topics came from authoritative news sources, such as Univision and NBC News. And we found that when people searched for news and information about the midterms, on average, more than 85% of the videos in search results came from quality news sources, such as CNN en Español and The Wall Street Journal. The remaining content covered topics like entertainment and finance.We also displayed key information panels from trusted sources underneath videos and in search results about the midterms. Available in both English and Spanish, viewers were shown additional context relevant to elections content — from more on how to vote ahead of the election to an election results panel that began surfacing on election day. In total, our election-related information panels and reminders have been shown over 2 billion times, over 100 million of which were in Spanish. Removing violative content before it’s widely viewedOver the years, our Trust and Safety teams have worked across policies and technology to create systems that uphold election integrity. On top of raising up quality information, that means removing election content that violates our Community Guidelines. This includes videos misleading voters on how to vote, encouraging interference in the democratic process, inciting violence (including against election workers), or advancing certain types of elections misinformation — like claiming that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was stolen or rigged. More like this Tackling misinformation during world-changing moments We’ve removed over 10,000 videos related to the midterms for violating our Community Guidelines, including those that violated our election integrity policy. 75% of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views. And we enforced our policies regardless of a speaker’s public figure status or their political viewpoint, and regardless of the language the content was in.At YouTube, we’re constantly working to make sure we can be a reliable source for timely news and information. We’ll apply learnings from these U.S. midterms to our ongoing work supporting the integrity of elections around the world.

Go to blog.youtube for more Today I am ringing the bell: As of September 2022, YouTube surpassed 80 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including those in trials. This is a 30 million member increase from the 50 million we announced last year, and a monumental moment for music on YouTube, our subscribers, and artists. We couldn’t have done it without you.You’ve heard me say it before, and I am going to say it again: YouTube’s twin engine of revenue – subscriptions and ads – is the real deal. In September, we announced a $6B revenue contribution to the music industry, with 30% coming from user generated content, and now we’ve reached this 80+ million milestone by building a subscription service with the music industry that puts fans FIRST. Hopefully these milestones demonstrate our commitment to becoming the #1 contributor of revenue to the music industry. More like this $6 billion paid to the music industry in 12 months You might be asking yourself how we reached over 80 million subscribers, given the 30 million member increase from last year. Here’s how:YouTube Premium: YouTube Premium is all of YouTube and YouTube Music, ad-free and available to play in the background or offline, on your mobile device or your TV. And now we’ve leveled it up even further with features like afterparties, which grant exclusive access to livestream content (like the in-person premiere of Adele’s music video floating down a lazy river drinking wine), plus access to discounts on the latest hardware and services from Google.Putting the fans FIRST: YouTube Premium allows fans to immerse themselves in what they love. And when they love music, we help them go deep. We prompt them to download videos or enter long listening sessions on the YouTube Music app, which is the home to over 100M official songs, plus an expansive catalog of live performances, remixes, and diamond in the rough deep-cuts. Premium makes it even easier for fans to enjoy every music format: long-form music videos, short-form videos, livestreams, podcasts, and more.Meaningful global partnerships: We understand the power of collaboration. Since the launch of YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, we’ve built partnerships with companies like Samsung, carriers like SoftBank (Japan), Vodafone (Europe), and LG U+ (Korea), and Google services such as Google One. These partners were critical in helping us reach this 80 million subscriber milestone and will continue helping us enhance the music experience for fans around the world.Test. Learn. Repeat. We are 7 years into the subscription game, and we continue to learn as we go. We know we can do better, and we never lose sight of that. It always starts with the user, and we’re learning what makes them want to join the party. Billions of music fans come to YouTube every month – the opportunity humbles us. More like this $6 billion paid to the music industry in 12 months YouTube offers fans the ability to discover music, consume music, and participate with music all in ONE place. And we believe offering this across all music formats (long-form videos, short-form videos, albums, live streams, etc.) puts us in our own lane. Continuing to partner with you all will allow us to work towards our mission of becoming the best place for every music fan. We couldn’t be more excited about building the future of music with you and your artists. Thank you again for helping us reach this milestone – on to the next one!

When we introduced this new format, we optimized the experience for the mobile creator and viewer. Today, we’re expanding viewing access to Shorts to our fastest growing surface: the TV screen. While this may seem like a natural next step, an incredible amount of thought and care has gone into bringing this vertical, mobile-first experience to the big screen. In this next installment of our Innovation Series, you’ll hear from two of the user experience (UX) design leads who made this leap a reality. Left: Before, Right: After Coming soon to a TV near you … Shorts! Starting today, viewers will be able to enjoy these bright bursts of video (60 seconds or less) on the big screen at home.While expanding Shorts to TV may seem straightforward conceptually, the journey to get here was not as simple as it sounds. That’s why we’re pulling back the curtain to share a behind-the-scenes look at the process of bringing a vertical, mobile-first format to TV.A look at the planning processTo make this moment happen, product managers, engineers, designers and researchers from the Shorts and TV teams came together to discuss how to bring this new video format to the big screen. It was important that the Shorts experience on TV felt consistent with what the community sees on mobile and also natural on the bigger screen. Love me, love me notTo better understand what viewers would like from a Shorts experience on TV, we took an unconventional approach to our research and asked participants to write either “Love” or “Breakup” letters to express their feelings about short form content on TV today. The “love letters” showed that viewers liked the community experience, watching content they love easily with friends and family. Meanwhile, the “breakup letters” showed that people felt it could be clunky, slow to load or lacked key features like sharing. Here are two examples of the notes we received: “I was skeptical before we first met but I must admit you showed me things I didn't know I was missing — the larger screen was a bigger and more comfortable viewing experience.” “I feel you have a little way to go before you’re ready for a relationship — be more user friendly... be easier to navigate. ” From top to bottom: Option A: Consistent, Option B: Customized, Option C: “Jukebox” style Making the jump from mobile to TVOur research told us that there would be unique perks of watching Shorts on the big screen. They're easier to watch with others, and the larger screen makes it a more comfortable viewing experience. But the design challenge remained: how could we preserve the essence of Shorts with vertical videos on wide screen TVs? We started by creating three very different design concepts:We wanted to know if the unique feel of Shorts could be conveyed in our conventional video player (Option A) or if it should be customized to better fill the blank spaces on either side of the video (Option B). We also considered a divergent option — the “Jukebox” style (Option C)— where multiple Shorts would fill the screen at the same time, taking full advantage of the TV screen’s additional space.After another round of research, feedback showed that the joy of Shorts gets lost in the consistent video player (Option A), and the Jukebox style (Option C) strayed too far from the essence of Shorts, which features one video at a time. The customized Shorts experience delivers the best of both worlds: a clean design while making the most of the wide screen’s additional space.We also learned that viewers wanted to be in the driver’s seat of the viewing experience and were happy to use the remote to manually advance to the next Short rather than have the feed autoplay. This was unusual. Typically we find that level of interactivity can be tedious with a remote, but in this case, short-form video is unique. Research indicated that people want to take charge of the viewing experience — just like with Shorts on mobile — and even expected it. Using prototypes to bring Shorts to life on TVIn our final phase of design, we created two high fidelity prototypes of a customized Shorts video player that incorporated feedback from our latest round of research. Now we were trying to balance a pure viewing experience with features that people expect from Shorts and YouTube, like comments, community actions (e.g., like, subscribe) and finding related videos.The “simple” prototype included the bare minimum: sidebars and basic functionality for engaging with Shorts. The “maximal” prototype gave a lot more visible functionality, from related tags to comments and included a color-sampled blurred background.When we tested these prototypes with the community, we learned that people preferred the “maximal” version. It made better use of the TV screen’s additional space and the color-sampled background made the experience feel more modern. Bringing our learnings liveIn the design rolling out today, you’ll see a modified version of that “maximal” prototype; we simplified the design of the right side rail, but will be looking to bring in additional functionality in future releases. We believe that this experience balances the fun, quirkiness of Shorts in a way that feels natural for TV. Watch YouTube Shorts on your TV As YouTube continues to make it easier to interact on TV, the richness of the Shorts experience will only grow. Bringing Shorts to TV is a great bridge to bring two of our most important experiences together to benefit both creators and viewers. Over the coming weeks, this experience will be rolling out on TV models (2019 and later) and on newer game consoles. We look forward to hearing your thoughts!

But the opportunity that healthcare professionals have to inform and educate their patients largely stops at the clinic door. The reality is that the majority of healthcare decisions are made outside the doctor’s office, in the everyday lives of our patients. That’s why YouTube Health has been working on additional ways to help doctors, nurses, mental health professionals and healthcare information providers to bring high quality health information into the spaces that people visit throughout their day – like their favorite video-sharing app.Today, we’re announcing that for the first time, certain categories of healthcare professionals and health information providers can apply to make their channels eligible for our health product features that were launched in the US last year. This includes health source information panels that help viewers identify videos from authoritative sources and health content shelves that highlight videos from these sources when you search for health topics, so people can more easily navigate and evaluate health information online.Up until now, these features have only been available to organizations such as educational institutions, public health departments, hospitals and government entities. This new step will allow us to expand to include high quality information from a wider group of healthcare channels.Applicants must have proof of their license, follow best practices for health information sharing as set out by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies, the National Academy of Medicine and the World Health Organization, and have a channel in good standing on YouTube. Full details on eligibility requirements are here. More like this Tackling health equity with Kaiser Family Foundation All channels that apply will be reviewed against these guidelines, and the license of the applying healthcare professional will be verified. In the coming months, eligible channels that have applied through this process will be given a health source information panel that identifies them as a licensed healthcare professional and their videos will appear in relevant search results in health content shelves. Health creators in the US can apply starting October 27th at health.youtube, and we’ll continue to expand availability to other markets and additional medical specialties in the future.This is a big step towards helping people more easily find and connect with content that comes from the extraordinary community of healthcare creators on YouTube – the smart, dedicated and creative folks who are transforming the ways that we share medical information. Whether you have busted medical myths with Doctor Mike, learned about disease processes from Osmosis, found ways to cope with anxiety with Dr. Ali Mattu or better understood fertility from Dr. Natalie Crawford, there are communities on YouTube that are helping people become more informed, engaged and empowered about their health.Effective communication is at the heart of improving people’s health, and we’re excited for this next phase in our work to connect people with highly authoritative health information that is both evidence-based and culturally relevant.

Since then, you could say we’ve gone through some changes. In this latest installment of our Innovation series, we’re sharing a design update that will make YouTube more modern and bring new features to power the YouTube you know and love.YouTube just celebrated its 17th birthday earlier this year and we wondered if it was time to give it a small makeover. So we gathered input from thousands of viewers around the world and heard there was a desire for a cleaner, more lively design that better represents what we’re all about. Video format not supported Starting today, we are rolling out a new look and several features that offer a more modern and immersive viewing experience while also improving how users watch videos. But don’t worry, the same YouTube you know and love is still at our core.A splash of colorColor was a key theme for us during the development phase. We wanted to add vibrancy to our apps without detracting from viewers’ habits, whether that’s enjoying their recommended videos or browsing for new content.After tinkering with several ideas, ambient mode came to life. And when the first design concept was met with overwhelmingly positive reactions from users during testing, we knew we were onto something.Using dynamic color sampling, ambient mode introduces a subtle effect so the app background color adapts to match the video. We were inspired by the light that screens cast out in a darkened room and wanted to recreate the effect so viewers were drawn right into the content and the video takes an even greater focus on our watch page. This feature will be available on web and mobile in dark theme. And while we’re on the subject, we heard your feedback and are excited to share that dark theme has been updated to be even darker so the colors truly pop on your screen. This will roll out on web, mobile and Smart TVs.For those who pride themselves on curating the perfect playlist, we didn’t forget about you! Video playlists will adopt the same color treatment and now show more details about each playlist so viewers can easily jump right in. It all starts with videoWe know that the main reason you come to YouTube is, well, to watch your favorite content. So we’re making improvements to bring the focus back to the video player. YouTube links in video descriptions will change to buttons, and frequent actions such as like, share and download, are now formatted to minimize distraction. Now, we’re making the watch page easier on the eyes: YouTube links in video descriptions will change to buttons, and frequent actions such as like, share and download, are now formatted to minimize distractions. The subscribe button is also getting a touch up: the new shape and high contrast make it really stand out, and while it’s no longer red, it's easier to find and way more accessible to everyone on both watch pages and channel pages.And we’re more than just our looks. After introducing and testing several new product features on youtube.com/new earlier this year, we heard from many of you wondering when we’d make these more broadly available. The wait ends here: we’re launching pinch to zoom and precise seeking to all users starting today. With pinch to zoom, you can now easily zoom in and out of a video while on your iOS or Android phone. And when you let go, the video stays zoomed in so you can enjoy the rest of the video in greater detail. Give your fingers a rest! Have you ever followed along to a tutorial on your phone, but needed to keep rewinding so you could master that one small step? Precise seeking helps solve this problem. Whether you’re on desktop or your mobile device, simply drag or swipe up while seeking to display a row of thumbnails in the video player and you’ll be able to make fine-tuned adjustments to get to the exact part in each video. More like this The future of interactivity in the living room Precise seeking builds on our recent improvements to video navigation that help you quickly find the parts you’re most interested in. We launched the ability to long press anywhere on the player to seek and to double tap with two fingers to skip chapters. We also added a graph that shows frequently replayed moments in a video.Feedback from our creators and viewers has always played an integral role at YouTube as our teams continue to think of ways to improve for our users; today’s updates were no exception. Over the next few weeks, these changes will gradually roll out to all users, so take the new design out for a spin and let us know what you think!

The YouTube space – boasting over 10,000 square feet – brought together the main gaming communities of the platform. In addition to marketing activations, we also hosted many popular Brazilian creators, including BRKsEdu, Nobru, Malena, Cerol, Skorpion Gamer, and Cherryrar.As we celebrate and reflect on this intense and memorable week, we’d like to share five of our most notable achievements from the event. Reconnecting with the gaming community 1. We connected YouTube gamers with their community of fans in person, after two years of waiting and many changesThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected us all in unique and unexpected ways. Many people have found on YouTube ways to inform themselves, learn, have well-being and also find entertainment, such as exploring the gaming universe. Today in Brazil, gaming content is the second most consumed on the platform and new gamers have emerged during this period. This is the case of creator Geleia, who went from a channel with 100 thousand subscribers to 6 million fans in just two years. At GBS we were able to meet game creators and fans in person after a long time and showed that YouTube continues to help creators and viewers connect. YouTube's Manuelle Pirez shares her thoughts on the state of gaming. 2. We highlighted the relevance of multi-format Gaming CreatorsDuring the first day of the event, Manuelle Pires talked about the state of YouTube Gaming in Brazil and the rise of the multi-format creator, Gaming creators in Brazil, and around the globe, are building powerhouse brands by leveraging Live Streaming, VOD and Shorts as multiple video formats to tell their stories. And they are earning money from multiple revenue streams. For example, gaming channels in Brazil that earn more than $10,000 USD grew by more than 50% from 2020 to 2021. Working with underrepresented youth to ensure the future of gaming. 3. We launched Favela GamingTo increase YouTube's social impact in Brazil, we are partnering with Final Level and Gerando Falcões to create Favela Gaming, a project to help young people from under-represented groups to build successful careers in the gaming industry, preparing the students for different roles such as a professional gamer, content creator or any other relevant area of ​​the segment. YouTube Shorts Challenge! 4. We celebrated our YouTube Shorts Challenge \"My Life Could be a Game\"At BGS, we kept celebrating gamers and their lives. To have fun with our ongoing Shorts Challenge we had a dedicated booth that included activities such as content production and challenge areas for the gaming community to participate in the challenge. Discussing the power and the possibilities of YouTube Shorts. 5. We reminded everyone of the impact of Shorts and our new monetization opportunitiesLast year, we launched YouTube Shorts in beta, since then, Gaming short-form content has found incredible success on YouTube. We’re just at the beginning of what gaming creators can do with Shorts and we want to make it even easier to create them. Starting in early 2023, Shorts-focused creators will be able to apply to YouTube’s Partner Program and aim to support creators who are even earlier in their YouTube journey, from gamers showing off their speed runs to trendsetting DIY makeup tutorials. A new level of YPP with lower requirements will offer earlier access to Fan Funding features like Super Thanks, Super Chat, Super Stickers and Channel Memberships. To reward creators across a range of formats, we’ll have paths for long-form, Shorts and Live creators to join this new tier in 2023. Want to know more about our new monetization possibilities?

That’s why today we’re introducing handles, a new way for people to easily find and engage with creators and each other on YouTube. Every channel will have a unique handle, making it easier for fans to discover content and interact with creators they love. Handles will appear on channel pages and Shorts, so they'll be instantly and consistently recognizable. It’ll soon be simpler and faster to mention each other in comments, community posts, video descriptions and more. For example, creators can be shouted out in a mention in comments or tagged in the title of a recent collab, helping them increase visibility and reach with new audiences. Handles join channel names as another way to identify a YouTube channel, but unlike channel names, handles are truly unique to each channel so creators can further establish their distinct presence and brand on YouTube.Over the next month, we will notify creators when they can choose a handle for their channel. In most cases, if a channel already has a personalized URL, that will automatically become their default handle, or they can opt to change the handle for their channel as soon as the notification in YouTube Studio comes through. Because handles must be unique and every channel on YouTube will have one, we're rolling them out gradually. The timing of when a creator will get access to the handles selection process depends on a number of factors, including overall YouTube presence, subscriber count and whether the channel is active or inactive.When a creator chooses their handle, we’ll also create a matching URL (ex: youtube.com/@handle) so creators can easily direct people to their content when they’re not on YouTube. If a channel already has a personalized URL, there’s no need to update links: they’ll automatically be redirected to the new, handle-based URL to create a better, more unified presence for creators on YouTube. We want to ensure creators can craft an identity as unique as their content, while giving viewers the confidence that they are interacting with their favorite creators.

That’s why mental health is a critical part of our work at YouTube Health — we want you to be able to find the information you need when you need it — whether it’s long-term coping strategies, immediate support in a crisis, educational content about a condition or just to know that you’re not alone.Throughout my career as a clinical psychologist, I have prioritized identifying and creating accessible mental health content for clients as well as clinicians. As a university health psychologist, I learned the importance of meeting students where they were with mental health information – and the need to create easy-to-understand, engaging clinical content for this young population. As I evolved into workplace mental health in my role as YouTube’s Chief Mental Health Advisor, I focused on increasing awareness of resources, reducing stigma surrounding mental health, and addressing systemic factors to support employees.I bring all of this with me in my new role as YouTube Health’s first Global Head of Mental Health, taking on the challenge of leading our efforts to help creators, clinicians, non-profit organizations, and the mental health community to make the most of our platform. I’m excited to share that the Mental Health Coalition, Partnership to End Addiction and the National Eating Disorders Association are all launching new series and content formats for their YouTube channels New mental health partnersI’m excited to share that the Mental Health Coalition, Partnership to End Addiction and the National Eating Disorders Association are all launching new series and content formats for their YouTube channels, joining industry leaders like the National Alliance on Mental Illness, The Trevor Project, Psych Hub and the Child Mind Institute in using video to reach and connect with people at scale about important mental health topics.The Mental Health Coalition will focus primarily on using YouTube Shorts to reach users with bite-sized psychoeducation. Partnership to End Addiction will focus on content to support families navigating topics from substance abuse prevention to treatment and recovery, and the National Eating Disorders Association will not only create expert content on disordered eating, but will also lean into helping folks share personal stories related to treatment and recovery. Working closely with the YouTube Health team, these organizations will build up a content library to help people living with mental health challenges, along with their families and loved ones, to better understand everything from signs and symptoms of various mental health issues to when to get help. Reducing isolationOne of the most important protective factors in mental health outcomes is ensuring that people don’t feel isolated in their mental health journey. It’s critical that those struggling with their mental health can find stories of hope, connect with a community and hear from others who have walked in their shoes and found a way through difficult times.That’s why we’ve focused extensively on mental health issues in our newly launched Personal Stories feature, which connects users searching for certain health topics with content from creators who share their personal experiences and stories about those topics. This feature can currently appear for users in the United States who search for topics related to anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction, bipolar disease, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and we’re continuing to expand the mental health issues covered by this new product feature regularly.Support in times of crisisMental health is not static and it is not binary -- rather, it exists on a spectrum that ranges from mental illness to mental wellness, and we want to support people at many different spots along this journey. For those who are experiencing acute distress, we provide direct connection with crisis support resources that promote help-seeking behaviors through highly visible resource panels.The power of feeling seen and heardThe need for mental health support is very clear, and we can’t solve our global mental health crisis with videos alone. But through YouTube, millions of people have shared their stories, found community, and truly felt seen and heard in their journey towards better mental health and well-being.I’m excited about the opportunity we have to reduce the isolation and stigma that still go hand-in-hand with mental illness, as we work together to make a happier, healthier world for everyone. Mental health resourcesManaging depression, anxiety and substance abuse can be lonely and isolating, whether you are experiencing these challenges yourself or supporting a loved one. You are not alone. If you or a loved one are struggling, there is help available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.In the United States, you can get in touch with the Lifeline by calling 988 or using the web chat service.

The first impulse is often to try and absorb as much information as possible to make sense of what it all means. Many times, people aren’t coming to YouTube with a health question at all. Instead, they come with a human question: how do I live with this? We have spent a lot of time at YouTube trying to better understand why people come to our platform when they have health questions. Some of what we found isn’t surprising – people visit YouTube when they want to understand something complex in simple, visual terms. Human biology is complicated and video can make it easier. YouTube creators are seen as down to earth messengers who explain things in an accessible way that people understand.But we also saw another pattern in the data. Many times, people aren’t coming to YouTube with a health question at all. Instead, they come with a human question: how do I live with this? People grappling with the reality of living with a health condition, especially a chronic one, were not looking for information. They were looking for support. How did other people live with this? Does it ever get better? How do I support my loved one through this? What meaning can I make of it? And they were all getting at the same human element: we help each other get through things. The need for connection and belonging is a universal one, and that’s proven with data – the science of peer support shows that social connectedness positively impacts both physical and mental health.Today, we’re launching a new way to do just that, with the introduction of our new Personal Stories shelf. Starting this week, when you search for health topics and questions related to certain conditions, you’ll see a shelf showing videos of personal stories relevant to the topic. To start, we are focusing on queries related to cancer, and mental health topics like anxiety and depression, but these topic areas will expand over the coming months. The Personal Stories shelf will be available for users in the US, but we plan to expand this feature to more markets around the world.To be eligible for the shelf, videos must primarily focus on a personal, authentic lived experience that is relevant to a specific physical or mental health condition. Content that is promotional in nature is not eligible for this feature, and all videos that appear in this feature must comply with our policies that prevent the spread of health misinformation.This work was deeply influenced and informed by the personal experiences of all of us on the YouTube Health team, but none more so than our colleague Maya Amoils. During an interview on the All the Wiser podcast, Maya shared that after her diagnosis, she sought insights from people who had walked in her shoes: “I wanted to learn from people who had sat in the unknown and learned to live with it.” Maya was in her late 20s when she was diagnosed with stage-4 ovarian cancer. She spoke both publicly and privately about the experience of that diagnosis, and the daily ins and outs of living with cancer. After her diagnosis, Maya found herself seeking connection with other young women who were going through a similar experience. She helped our YouTube Health team understand the need for people to have shared human experience to complement information – to connect and know that you’re not alone. That’s why, in addition to her role as the Mental Health partnership lead, Maya was also our product consultant and helped guide our work to better define, algorithmically identify, and showcase people’s personal health stories on YouTube. She helped us to center the perspectives of people who were dealing with the human experience of illness through her own superpower – an uncanny ability to connect easily and deeply with everyone who met her.We lost our dear friend Maya this past January. She leaves behind a legacy of giving not only through this project, but through Maya’s Way, her foundation that supports women under age 40 who are undergoing cancer care to access integrative medicine as a support to their treatment, and helps them to live with optimal wellbeing despite their illness.In the months since Maya passed, we have been thinking about how to honor her and her work on this project. It is difficult to articulate how much we miss Maya. But sharing her story and the ways that she impacted all of us who were so fortunate to know and work with her is one way that we can demonstrate all that we learned from her. She has made an impact that will live on through all of the YouTube creators, patients and caregivers who find connection and support in difficult times. We hope that each of our viewers finds their own “Maya” when they need help along the way."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/top-moments-made-on-youtube-event-recap-icymi","date":"2022-09-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Creators","Music","Artists","News & Events"],"title":"4 can't miss moments from our Made on YouTube event","text":"Five BIG Takeaways from Made on YouTube Five BIG Takeaways from Made on YouTube Last week, we unveiled a lot of news at our Made on YouTube event — a day packed with announcements and interviews to set the tone for our next chapter in celebrating the heart and soul of YouTube: creators.

YouTube Partner Program Update for Shorts Creators 1. Neal announces a massive YouTube Partner Program update for Shorts creatorsKicking off the event, our own Neal Mohan took the stage to announce an exciting update to the YouTube Partner Program so that Shorts creators can start monetizing their content after they reach 1,000 subscribers and 10 million Shorts views over the span of 90 days. This will allow creators — short or long-form — to earn money no matter what format their content thrives in. Revenue Sharing comes to Shorts 2.

But we knew that was just the beginning. Launching the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) in 2007 meant that creators could, for the first time, share in the revenue and earn money from their content. This unique business model means we only succeed when our creators do. And creators are succeeding—these creator entrepreneurs are building successful businesses of their own with employees and full-fledged operations. Over the past three years, we’ve paid creators, artists and media companies over $50B1.Today, we introduce the next chapter in rewarding creativity on our platform, no matter what that looks like. We’re announcing more ways for creators to become partners, new ways to make money with Shorts, and a reimagining of how the music industry and creators work together. More pathways for creators to make money Back when YPP began, YouTube had one creative format—the standard horizontal video—and one main source of revenue: ads. Fast forward to today, creators are continually testing the boundaries of expression, from 15-second vertical Shorts, to 15-minute videos, to 15-hour live streams. And they’re building their businesses based on diversified revenue streams, from Fan Funding to brand sponsorships.YouTube now offers 10 ways for our over 2M partners to make money. But we're not done. Today, we're expanding our partner program, meaning more creators and artists will have the opportunity to make money on YouTube across different creative formats.Starting in early 2023, Shorts-focused creators can apply to YPP by meeting a threshold of 1,000 subscribers and 10M Shorts views over 90 days. These new partners will enjoy all the benefits our program offers, including the various ways to make money like ads on long-form and Fan Funding.We also want to support creators who are even earlier in their YouTube journey, from gamers showing off their speed runs to trendsetting DIY makeup tutorials. A new level of YPP with lower requirements will offer earlier access to Fan Funding features like Super Thanks, Super Chat, Super Stickers and Channel Memberships. To reward creators across a range of formats, we’ll have paths for long-form, Shorts and Live creators to join this new tier in 2023. Stay tuned for more details.To be clear, nothing will change with our existing criteria—creators can still apply to YPP when they reach 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours. But these changes reflect the diversity of our growing creator community. Creators can choose the one option that best fits their channel while we maintain the same level of brand safety for advertisers. You can learn more here. New ways to earn for Shorts creators Video format not supported The popularity of short-form video has exploded on YouTube, with over 30B daily views and 1.5B monthly logged-in users, bringing an ascendant creativity across every topic, vertical, and region of the world. To start rewarding this new creative class, we launched a temporary Shorts Fund. Now, we're expanding our unique business model to this new format: revenue sharing is coming to Shorts!Here’s how it'll work:Beginning in early 2023, current and future YPP creators will be eligible for revenue sharing on Shorts.In Shorts, ads run between videos in the Shorts Feed. So, every month, revenue from these ads will be added together and used to reward Shorts creators and help cover costs of music licensing.From the overall amount allocated to creators, they will keep 45% of the revenue, distributed based on their share of total Shorts views. The revenue share remains the same, no matter if they use music or not.This brand new approach allows us to reward all YPP creators who make up the Shorts experience, not just to those with videos running next to ads. In addition, since Music fuels some of our most vibrant and memorable Shorts, it simplifies the complexities of music licensing, so that creators don’t have to worry about whether or not they use music in their Short.We expect the majority of our Shorts Fund recipients to earn more money under this new model, which was built for long term sustainability. Instead of a fixed fund, we're doubling down on the revenue sharing model that has supercharged the creator economy and enabled creators to benefit from the platform's success. Revenue sharing on Shorts ads is yet another way for creators to make money—it adds to our full suite of products, which enabled us to pay creators, artists and media companies over $50B over the past three years.We’re also launching Super Thanks for Shorts in beta to thousands of creators, with a complete rollout expected next year. Viewers can show their appreciation for their favorite Shorts, and creators can interact with their fans through purchased, highlighted Super Thanks comments. And we’re bringing together brands and Shorts creators as part of YouTube BrandConnect. Evolving the soundtrack of YouTube Music is essential to Shorts and across YouTube—over the years, we’ve seen how creators can give classics new life, or bring a local hit to the global stage. But the complexities of music licensing has meant that most long-form videos that feature music (yes, even that one workout video you didn’t finish) don’t result in the creator getting paid. So, in recognizing an opportunity to build a bridge between the music industry and creators on our platform, we’re redefining how music can be featured in creator videos.We’re introducing Creator Music, a new destination in YouTube Studio that gives YouTube creators easy access to an ever-growing catalog of music for use in their long-form videos. Creators can now buy affordable, high-quality music licenses that offer them full monetizing potential—they will keep the same revenue share they’d usually make on videos without any music.And for creators who don’t want to buy a license up front, they’ll be able to use songs and share revenue with the track’s artist and associated rights holders. Creator Music, currently in beta in the US and expanding to more countries in 2023, will offer a streamlined process for creators—they’ll be able to instantly see the terms for their song selection.We believe Creator Music will mean more amazing creator-artist collabs, more new tunes in viewers' playlists, and more ways for artists to break through—all while continuing to put money in creators' pockets.It’s been incredible to witness entirely new industries built by creators on our platform. Our model since 2007 has been to put the creator at the heart of our economic engine and our shared success. We can’t wait to see what gets Made on YouTube over the next 15 years.

These are called social determinants of health, and they can include a variety of factors like access to housing, food security, education and income.But there’s another area that we also want to focus on: information as a determinant of health. Equitable access to high-quality information allows folks to make smart decisions about their own health — and it’s something we want to provide outside of the limited opportunities physicians have with people in the exam room. Under THE-IQ, KFF will work with The Loveland Foundation, National Birth Equity Collaborative (NBEC) and Satcher Health Leadership Institute to conceptualize and produce video series that examine health equity That’s why YouTube Health is launching THE-IQ – tackling health equity through Information Quality, a new program in partnership with KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) that was announced today at the annual Google Health Equity Summit. THE-IQ brings together the work of three organizations that serve underrepresented and / or under-resourced communities to bring their voices and perspectives to audiences on YouTube.Under THE-IQ, KFF will work with The Loveland Foundation, National Birth Equity Collaborative (NBEC) and Satcher Health Leadership Institute to conceptualize and produce video series that examine health equity through the lens of the respective areas of focus of the three organizations: mental health, maternal health, and healthcare access. Production will take place this month with videos planned for release in November.The Social Impact team at KFF leads creative strategy, content development and media placement, working to provide accessible facts and dispel misinformation about important health issues facing underserved communities. Leveraging their proven track record in using video to scale health communication messages, KFF will provide hands-on production coordination for the participating organizations in THE-IQ. They will also provide access to their in-house experts across policy analysis, polling and social impact media campaigns to help each organization develop their unique voice on YouTube. Each organization will create videos on specific areas of interest and specialization: The Loveland Foundation will focus on mental health access for Black women and girls, Satcher Health Leadership Institute will focus on the root causes or upstream determinants and fundamental drivers of health inequities, including data challenges and opportunities. And the National Birth Equity Collaborative’s focus is tied to improving the health outcomes of Black birthing people.THE-IQ is the latest effort from YouTube Health to reimagine how health information is shared — working between health authorities, creative digital content creators and medical experts to make the most of what digital video can offer."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/the-next-chapter-for-learning-on-youtube","date":"2022-09-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Learning & Education","Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"The next chapter for Learning on YouTube","text":"Every day, people come to YouTube to learn something new.

Viewers who choose to buy a Course can watch the video ad-free and play it in the background. Courses will arrive first in the United States and South Korea in beta before expanding to more countries.“Learning a new skill, like how to code, can be so difficult — from knowing where to start to where to go next — it’s a lot for someone to do on their own, and it's easy to get lost. On my YouTube channel, Coder Coder, I’ve helped millions of viewers learn how to code and stay motivated throughout their coding journey. I’m so excited to be able to offer my viewers Courses, to help bring more even structure to their learning, provide exclusive content and, ultimately, enable them to be even more successful in their careers.” – Jess Chan, YouTube Learning Creator and founder of Coder Coder Finally, to help learners apply what they’ve learned, we’re introducing Quizzes — a new way for creators to help viewers test their knowledge. For example, a math creator who recently posted a series on algebra can create a Quiz on the Community tab to ask their viewers a question related to a concept taught in their latest video. Quizzes will roll out in beta over the coming months, with all creators who have the Community tab gaining access to Quizzes next year.Learning remains a top priority for YouTube. Just this year, we introduced an option for creators to add metadata that allows them to target their content to specific grade levels and topics. We’ve also added a Ukrainian version of the Learning destination to help ensure that Ukranians have access to important educational content, even as the war continues. Our goal is to keep making learning easier on the platform for everyone in the community, whether that be creators, students in classrooms, or learners around the world.

That’s why over the years we’ve built policies, systems and teams that raise authoritative content and limit the spread of harmful misinformation. This work is especially critical when it comes to supporting elections around the world. Here in the U.S., our dedicated team of elections experts has been focused on preparing for the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. Whether it’s learning about when and where to vote, or finding information about political candidates, we take seriously our commitment to connecting viewers with trusted resources. With most state primaries complete and Election Day only two months away, here’s a look at our ongoing efforts to support the integrity of this year’s midterms. When you search for midterms content on YouTube, our systems are prominently recommending content coming from authoritative national and local news sources. Making authoritative information front and centerOur driving goal is for viewers to have access to high-quality election news and information. When you search for midterms content on YouTube, our systems are prominently recommending content coming from authoritative national and local news sources like PBS NewsHour, The Wall Street Journal, Univision and local ABC, CBS and NBC affiliates. This same approach goes for videos in your “watch next” panels. Working in tandem, our systems are also limiting the spread of harmful election misinformation by identifying borderline content and keeping it from being widely recommended. Images, headlines, and sources are simulated to illustrate this upcoming feature. To give people even more relevant context around elections content, we’ll be showing a variety of information panels in English and Spanish from authoritative sources underneath videos and in search results about the midterms.For searches or videos related to voting, an information panel directs viewers to Google’s “how to vote” and “how to register to vote” features. And on the YouTube homepage, we’re showing reminders on voter registration and election resources. Images, headlines, and sources are simulated to illustrate this upcoming feature. In the coming weeks, when people search for federal candidates, they’ll see a panel highlighting key information, including their political party and the office they’re running for. Images, headlines, and sources are simulated to illustrate this upcoming feature. Starting on Election Day, people will see timely context around election results underneath videos and at the top of search results related to the midterms. This information panel will also link to Google’s election results feature, allowing people to track election results in real time. On the YouTube homepage, we’ll highlight live coverage of election night from authoritative news sources and provide a link to midterms results.News publishers, political creators, and campaigns across the political spectrum also have ongoing support from our partnerships team this election season. This team helps campaigns learn how to reach voters using their YouTube channels and through features like Shorts, live streaming, Community posts and Premieres. Keeping violative content off YouTube As our systems connect viewers to authoritative content and limit the spread of harmful misinformation, we’re also removing election content that violates our policies. As our systems connect viewers to authoritative content and limit the spread of harmful misinformation, we’re also removing election content that violates our policies. This includes misleading voters on how to vote, encouraging interference in the democratic process, inciting violence, or advancing certain types of elections misinformation. We enforce our policies consistently for everyone, regardless of the speaker’s public figure status or their political viewpoint.We’ve already removed a number of videos related to the midterms for violating our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service. This includes videos that violated our election integrity policy by claiming widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, or alleging the election was stolen or rigged. We’ve also issued strikes to channels that uploaded violative content related to the midterms, resulting in a temporary suspension from uploading new content.Our teams continue to monitor the midterms closely, working to quickly remove content that violates our policies. We’ll stay vigilant ahead of, during, and after Election Day. Promoting media literacy skillsWe’ve also been exploring ways to help people assess the content they watch and share. In the coming weeks, we’ll launch an educational media literacy campaign across YouTube providing tips on identifying different manipulation tactics used to spread misinformation – from using emotional language to cherry picking information. This campaign will first launch in the U.S., and we’ll expand to other countries over time.As Election Day approaches, teams across YouTube and Google will continue to fine tune and improve upon all these efforts. We’re proud of the investments we’ve made to support elections, but know we need to stay vigilant and nimble in our approach. We’ll continue to closely monitor new developments and make needed adjustments along the way. Elections are one of the cornerstones of our society, and we’re committed to keeping viewers informed and protected this November, and for elections to come."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-music-summer-recap-2022","date":"2022-08-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Music","News & Events"],"title":"YouTube Music’s endless summer","text":"The best summer memories are made through music.

However, over the years we have also gained a better understanding of the tremendous benefits YouTube’s creative ecosystem provides to our economy, society, and culture. Today we are releasing the findings of the latest Oxford Economics study on the state of the creator economy, which illustrates just how profound of an impact our creators are having on American life. Oxford Economics estimates that [in all,] YouTube’s creative ecosystem contributed over $25 billion to the US GDP. I joined YouTube less than five years after ads were introduced onto the platform. A little over a year later, the company launched the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) so creators could directly share in the success of YouTube’s advertising business. Back then, the concept of a content creator was still in its infancy, and the idea that people could grow a business or earn steady, meaningful income through personalized video content was quite novel. Today, YouTube offers ten monetization options through which millions of creators earn money to pursue their passions, support their families and create additional jobs by hiring employees.This report shows that YouTube continues to be one of the best places for entrepreneurs. It’s where someone with a creative vision can grow an audience and earn reliable income. It’s also where people who want to take control of their own future can learn the skills they’ll need to pursue a new career or build a business outside of YouTube. Oxford Economics estimates that in 2021 YouTube’s creative ecosystem supported more than 425,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the US. In all, YouTube’s creative ecosystem contributed over $25 billion to the US GDP. YouTube creator Kukuwa Fitness These are no doubt exciting numbers, but even more impressive are the individual stories behind them. Like that of Kukuwa Kyereboah, who during the COVID-19 pandemic was forced to switch from in person classes to online classes to keep her students, and fans going. Kukuwa wanted to continue sharing her love for dance and her native African culture with the world, so she doubled down on YouTube. There, she discovered new ways to engage and grow her audience. She shared that YouTube is increasingly part of her income. YouTube creators White House on the Hill We're seeing more creators look to YouTube to showcase their unique experiences and expertise. Take Jake and Becky Grzenda, who left city life to raise their family on a farm in rural Missouri, where they wanted to grow sustainable, healthy food and set a positive example for their children in the process. They initially turned to YouTube to learn the ins and outs of farming, but eventually grew their own following on the platform by sharing videos about their parenting and farming journey.Their YouTube channel has grown considerably since they first launched it in 2017. Today, YouTube is a significant part of their income and that revenue has allowed them to continue expanding their operation while sharing the simple joys of farm life with their viewers.I have the privilege to interact with people like Kukuwa, Jake and Becky regularly. They are a source of inspiration and remind me why we at YouTube work to ensure YouTube is the best place for them and other creative entrepreneurs. That's why we have continued to expand the ways for creators to connect with fans — through multiple formats like Shorts, Live, and Audio — and to continue to explore additional ways to create value for users and for creators to make money.

Emerging artists like JVKE and EMELINE and global superstars like BTS, The Weeknd, Post Malone and Halsey are proving that Shorts can build REAL connections with fans around the world.With a mixture of DIY performances, collaborations and intimate Shorts showcasing his creative process and personal life, rising star JVKE has added 1.4 million subscribers to his official Artist channel thanks to Shorts since January. On his experience using Shorts, JVKE said:“I have looked up to musicians on YouTube since I was 13, and the moment I reached the 1 million+ subscriber milestone on my own channel was a moment I'll never forget. Having the ability to combine short-form content on YouTube Shorts with long-form video has been a game changer for me and has helped me reach so many new fans with my music. I wouldn’t be experiencing this level of success without YouTube Shorts, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.” Emeline EMELINE - cinderella's dead Emerging singer-songwriter EMELINE has used Shorts to grow her subscriber base by 150,000. She has also seen a 90% increase in long-form video views since she started posting Shorts on YouTube. On her experience using Shorts, EMELINE said:“As an artist in 2022, the importance of short-form content is incredibly clear. Using YouTube Shorts regularly helped my song ‘Cinderella’s Dead’ take on a brand new life of its own and reach people around the world I might not have reached otherwise. Being able to engage with new fans so directly on the Community tab and keep them up to date on new music I’m working on with both short- and long-form videos in real time has been so cool. It’s truly inspiring for me to see how my music has connected this way and in such a short amount of time.” BTS: \"ARMY, we come so far together...\" BTS: \"ARMY, we come so far together...\" Shorts have also played an important role for global superstars like BTS, The Weeknd, Post Malone, Halsey and more during critical music moments, from releasing albums and dropping new music, to premiering music videos, and even on tour. To launch Shorts globally, we partnered with BTS for the incredible “Permission to Dance challenge,” and just a year later, we are working with them again on the #MyBTStory campaign, celebrating their brand new anthology album, Proof. In a letter from BTS to the ARMY asking them to share their #MyBTStory memories exclusively on Shorts, they wrote:“From our first concert to the world's biggest stages, to video premieres and album releases, you have been there for us and we want to relive these unforgettable BTS moments with you.” Why NOW is the time to get on board “ I think short-form video could help crowdsource and make it easier for kids to find the soundtrack of their youth, but then you have to be prompted, and it has to lead you [to long-form content]...” Lyor Cohen Bloomberg Interview Our Global Head of Music, Lyor Cohen, recently spoke with Bloomberg about why Shorts have become so critical for artist development. Lyor also echoed that sentiment in his latest letter to the music industry.As we further develop and build Shorts with music in mind, we’ll continue to work closely with all of our partners across the business to ensure that YouTube is THE PLACE for their artists to build long-term, sustainable careers. We know how important these relationships are to our continued success. As Kevin Lipson, EVP of Global Commerce and Digital Strategy at Republic Records, shared:\"Shorts has quickly become a staple in our roster’s marketing strategies, social presence and album campaigns. It allows both developing artists and global superstars to tap into their fan bases and future channel subscribers.\" Kevin added, \"The consistent flow of unique short-form video content is driving increased consumption throughout YouTube’s entire ecosystem—most importantly taking fans through a journey of storytelling, from the first studio session to the video shoot and then world tour. Shorts is our guide into the artist’s vision that will shape pop culture.\"Zack Gershen, Partner and Head of Digital Strategy at Mtheory, offered similar sentiments, noting:\"Shorts has had a significant impact on both our label and management services roster. And that's been across a wide cross-section of genres and artists, regardless of where they are on the development spectrum.\" As Zack explained, \"There is of course the engagement on the short-form content itself, which we've all seen explode across the entire industry and social ecosystem, but equally encouraging is how it has reinvigorated artist channels on YouTube. That's been evident across several data points—percentage increase in long-form video views, long-form video reach growth, and net subscriber gains. This all makes Shorts another incredible way to engage with audiences and another key tool within a growing suite of tools that YouTube has developed.\"And Capitol Music Group President Arjun Pulijal also echoed these sentiments, saying:“We’ve already seen firsthand the way that Shorts has organically driven artist discovery, streaming, and subscriber growth. We’re always looking for ways to bring the conversation back to the artist, and I’m excited by the opportunities for world building and connectivity that can go beyond a snippet of audio.\" He then concluded, \"Unique Shorts content that lives in the same ecosystem as an artist's long-form videos lends itself to a more holistic and immersive experience for artists and fans alike.”The momentum is real and the time is now for the music industry to join the FUN on YouTube Shorts!"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-gaming-drops-its-july-lineup","date":"2022-06-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Gaming","News & Events"],"title":"It's here…YouTube Gaming drops its July lineup","text":"We’re heading into the heart of summer, and just when you feel like you might be getting a little bored, we’ve got an incredible slate of gaming content for you.

I remember watching my favorite shows and news on TV, listening to music with an MP3 player, looking for classes to learn new things, sifting through manual books, calling all sorts of experts to find out how to solve household problems, and connecting with people with similar interests. I still do every one of them, but now I do them all on YouTube. That’s because 15 years ago on June 19, 2007, we launched our first localized version of YouTube in APAC. Since then, creators around APAC have pushed the boundaries on creativity to create new trends that share their art, culture, food — and they’ve grown their businesses and audiences on YouTube while doing it. So what did this past decade and a half bring?15 years of innovationSince we landed in APAC in 2007, we introduced the YouTube Partner Program in APAC. This allowed creators to be rewarded for their work, all while dancing our way to the first video to hit 1 billion views. We also hosted the first offline festival for creators and their fans to connect in Singapore.One of the most exciting new products we launched got its start in APAC, when we tested an early beta of YouTube Shorts in India in September 2020. Since then, we saw creators using Shorts to make creative and innovative content. We used what we learned from this launch to bring Shorts to more countries, with it now available in more than 100 countries around the world. Today, YouTube Shorts is averaging over 30 billion daily views — four times as many as a year ago. As of December 2021, we had hit 5 trillion all-time views on Shorts!We are also investing to make YouTube the next generation of commerce. YouTube acquired simsim in July 2021 to help small businesses and retailers in India reach new customers in even more powerful ways. We have also been testing out live shopping pilots with creators and brands in Korea and Indonesia. Sleepground, a Korean gaming creator who recently participated in the pilot, said her fans enjoyed the seamless experience of purchasing merchandise related to her content on our platform, and that she saw an increased level of interest in her content after the livestream pilot! We look forward to bringing more magic into this field and making shopping more accessible to creators and viewers across APAC soon.These innovations in and from APAC showed significant impact on creators. As of December 2021, over 120,000 channels in APAC have more than 100,000 subscribers. That’s an increase of over 40 percent year-over-year. Meanwhile, over 10,000 channels have crossed the one million subscribers milestone, an increase of over 35 percent year-over-year.With that kind of growth, it’s easy to see why some of your favorite YouTube content and global trends seem to be stemming right out of Asia. Ash CaTs explainer APAC Culture and Trends Manager Ashley Chang highlights 5 regional trends that have influenced the world. Home to now global trendsCreators and artists in APAC have been shaping culture globally, creating and inspiring new trends and fresh takes on content.Just to name a few: Mukbang, a trend that started in Korea, literally translates to ‘eating broadcast.’ It was originally about creators consuming culinary delicacies, but has evolved in more creative and innovative formats, including cooking & mukbang, animation mukbang, one-color mukbang and many more! Now we see all kinds of creators publishing mukbang videos to be a part of the trend.Virtual creators use virtual avatars generated by computer graphics to engage with their audiences. After the style was popularized by creators like Kizuna AI, the trend began to expand internationally, with English-speaking virtual creators like Gawr Gura reaching global audiences.Village Cooking is a genre of cooking content that has emerged from villages of India. Known for its use of traditional recipes, large dishes and free serving to the community children and elders, this type of video has been thriving on YouTube, helping us learn about local culture, food and customs.Of course, it’s impossible to discuss Asian cultural influences without mentioning K-Pop, a music genre that YouTube has been a home for since its early days. From hosting a K-Pop concert in the US in 2012 to partnering with artists and labels to help broaden the reach of K-Pop, YouTube has been dedicated to supporting our partners to grow and go global. In fact, the first YouTube video to hit 1 billion views was the iconic K-Pop song, “Gangnam Style”! Not to mention, 9 out of top 10 24 hour debut music videos, and two out of three most subscribed official artist channels, belong to K-Pop groups.Lastly, we’ve seen a new style of vlogging emerge from APAC with Silent Vlogging, where creators make less self-focused vlog content without talking to the camera and often without showing their physical appearance. Silent Vlogging focuses on routine, daily activities, where creators, who choose to remain anonymous, subtly seed the message of embracing the ordinary aspects of life, usually through stunning aesthetics.APAC creators’ creativity and tenacity, coupled with Asia’s position at the heart of the evolving mobile internet, led to the growth of not only these now global trends, but also the creator economy we now see in APAC. Turning passion to paycheckOne of the things I’m most proud of about YouTube’s evolution is its transformation into a platform that not only supports art and creativity, but livelihoods and society at large. Today, many creators are making a living on YouTube and building a completely new global economy that’s seen incredible growth. YouTube's creative ecosystem supported more than 850,000 jobs in Australia, India, Japan and Korea combined, and contributed more than US$4 billion to local GDPs in those four countries in 2020. Over 14 years ago, we introduced the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) in APAC, a first-of-its-kind open monetization program where we share the majority of revenue with creators. Globally, we now have more than 2 million creators participating in YPP, and we paid more than $30 billion in advertising and alternative monetization revenue to creators, artists, and media companies within a three-year period prior to November 2020.As creators get rewarded for sharing their passion and knowledge with viewers, we’re also seeing them invest more in the quality of content which leads to more rewards, creating a virtuous cycle.According to Oxford Economics reports, YouTube's creative ecosystem supported more than 850,000 jobs in Australia, India, Japan and Korea combined, and contributed more than US$4 billion to local GDPs in those four countries in 2020. You can find more about the reports here: Australia, India, Japan, Korea.Creators make a true economic impact, and so prioritizing ways to help them build their businesses will continue to be a top priority for us in the next years to come. To the next 15 and more years to comeToday, we celebrate 15 years of YouTube in APAC. While there have been significant progress in building a safe space to create, connect and share, our work here isn’t done. In the next 15 years, we commit to refining and investing in the many sides of the platform, so that when people come on YouTube — regardless of location or format — they will always have the most valuable experience.We have been investing in the policies, resources and products needed to protect the community and trusted creators, including our responsibility framework around four principles: removing violative content, raising authoritative voices, reducing borderline content and rewarding trusted creators. We will continue to build on our work to reduce harmful content across all our products and policies while allowing a diverse range of voices to thrive.Thank you for an inspiring 15 years."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-beauty-festival--2022-highlights-recap-jennifer-aniston-hailey-bieber","date":"2022-06-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Creators","Culture & Trends","News & Events"],"title":"7 can't miss moments from Beauty Festival 2022","text":"YouTube’s second Beauty Festival — our first in-person and Shoppable live event — just wrapped!

At YouTube Health, we’re constantly working to make it easier for people to find reliable information to help answer questions about their health. This includes partnering with leading health organisations to create and surface video content, and putting health professionals at the core of our efforts to connect people with helpful content.We’re also expanding the use of product features to surface authoritative and relevant health information. Starting this week, people in the UK will see these new features next to some health-related searches and videos. Health source information panels and content shelvesWe’re adding health source information panels to help viewers identify videos from authoritative sources and health content shelves that more effectively highlight videos from these sources when you search for specific health topics. These context cues are aimed at helping people more easily navigate and evaluate credible health information. We worked with the National Health Service (NHS) to develop an approach to informing which UK channels would be eligible for an information panel. This approach included the NHS reviewing a set of principles developed by an expert panel convened by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) to evaluate these for the UK context, and publishing a Standard for Creating Health Content that outlines essential requirements and best practice guidance for organisations to follow in order to create high quality health content.By completing the self-certification process, an NHS organisation channel will be eligible for the information panel indicating NHS credibility. As a starting point in the UK, only NHS organisations will be invited to self-certify against the NHS Standard for Creating Health Content.The health content shelves will include videos related to the health topic you searched for and may include a mix of content from self-certified NHS sources and authoritative videos from other countries/regions that match your search language.This approach for the UK was reviewed by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC), which concluded that this approach helps give a solid basis for determining the authoritativeness of health sources on social media platforms.These new features are an important step to strengthen our ability to connect people with high quality information — but we can’t do it alone.I’m proud of the partnerships we’ve built over the last year with a range of national and regional NHS organisations, as well as with clinicians and creators, to further increase the accessibility of high quality health content on our platform. Our partnership with Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH), for example, has led to the creation of video series dedicated to health information for children, young people and their families. The series answers frequently searched questions around diabetes, depression, anxiety and more. The GOSH Young Person’s Forum (YPF) had early input into the video formats, and as Rosie, a YPF member who is now 18 and was an in-patient at GOSH, tells us, “having young people involved in the planning of these videos can help the important messages reach as many young people as possible.” “ The next phase in health communication is video, where we can connect with people and answer their questions in a way that is both visual and personal.” Dr. Garth Graham I’ve spent my career trying to advance the ways that we can better reach people with the information they need to make the right health choices for themselves and their families, and I’ve had a front row seat as our approaches evolved from pamphlets handed out at doctor’s offices to online patient portals and telemedicine.I believe that the next phase in health communication is video, where we can connect with people and answer their questions in a way that is both visual and personal. I joined YouTube Health because I believe that this platform, with 2 billion monthly active users, has the potential to be a transformative tool for public health and can positively impact communities at scale. We know that there is more work to be done and our investment will continue for the long term."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-announces-class-of-2023-black-voices-fund-application","date":"2022-06-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Music","Artists","Creators","Events","News & Events"],"title":"YouTube Announces Class of 2023 Black Voices Fund Application","text":"“ As a content creator a lot of your work is often isolated. #YouTubeBlack gave me the opportunity to build a community with people who not only looked like me, but deeply understood my journey as a creator.” Sofi Ibrahim (TheOdditty) Creator and current BVF cohort Two years ago we announced the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund to amplify Black perspectives and experiences.

Vanessa has dedicated her time to bringing her subscribers into a world of personal discovery and self reflection through tarot. Check out our interview with Vanessa! Vanessa Somuayina What made you interested in tarot and how did you start using it?I’ve always had an affinity for all things wellbeing. I also always felt like there were energies that I could feel, which were exclusive to me and sort of inexplicable. So as a child I used to collect stones and crystals, which led me to discover tarot as a young adult.At first I was skeptical about tarot, but I quickly realized that it helps me self-reflect and pose questions I never would have considered if it weren’t for the cards. I actually did not lay or pull any cards until I had a basic understanding of everything, as I felt my very first reading on myself would reveal a special meaning. And it did. The little three-card reading predicted that practicing tarot would lead to greater fulfillment for me.I started using tarot more in everyday life, to seek more clarity for both simple and complex questions. I learned that while many things are written off in the mainstream as \"mere coincidences,\" tarot opens up a \"what if there's a reason behind this\" type of dialogue and gives these events meaningful explanations. When did you start incorporating tarot into your YouTube videos and what was the response when you started posting tarot videos?I began incorporating tarot into my videos over three-and-a-half years ago, as I wanted to share something that helped me so much with others, in the hopes of viewers finding value in this as well. While I was terrified to post my very first tarot reading video, the response was quite surprisingly very positive. Those first few comments from people who found my content valuable are what kept me going. I haven’t looked back since! “ While many things are written off as 'mere coincidences,' tarot opens up a 'what if there's a reason behind this' type of dialogue and gives them meaningful explanations” Vanessa Somuayina How have you seen this community on YouTube grow over the past few years?I would say that the tarot community has definitely gained a lot of traction over the past few years. There are so many tarot readers out here now, it’s hard to keep track! I would also say that the community has grown in the sense of reaching an increasingly more mainstream audience.How are you celebrating the Tarot community this year?That’s a good question! I’ll most-likely start off by lighting some candles and burning incense, while laying some tarot cards for myself and my husband. I will most definitely be going for a walk in nature and spending a good chunk of my day just reflecting and meditating - in honor of what tarot helps so many of us do.

In this next installment of our Innovation Series, we’re giving you an inside look at how we design YouTube for TVs, including a new feature that brings the best of YouTube to the big screen, making the TV experience even better and more interactive for our viewers. When the YouTube app for TV screens launched 12 years ago, it became a great way for our viewers to watch their favorite YouTube videos on a bigger screen than their computers or mobile phones. Since then, we’ve continued to improve this experience as the popularity of streaming services and watching YouTube on TV has continued to grow. As of January 2022, on average viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily.As more people watch YouTube on their TVs, one challenge we face as a design team is how to keep the experience simple, streamlined and intuitive, but also bring the best of YouTube to the TV. Today, we’re excited to share a new feature that gives TV viewers a direct way to access the full power of YouTube at your fingertips while watching on your TV.How we design for the living roomYouTube offers a rich set of features for our global community of more than 2 billion viewers — from liking or commenting to engage with a video, to supporting your favorite creators by subscribing, joining channel memberships, or even sending a Super Sticker.And on TV screens, we want to offer this same YouTube experience you know and love. But this also poses a handful of design challenges. Our research team has spent hundreds of hours diving into users’ experiences with YouTube on their TVs. We know remote controls can be difficult to use and navigate with, most TVs don’t have web browsers built in, and you generally have less space to work with since you’re always watching video in a full screen experience. Over 80% of people said they use another digital device while watching TV So how do we design for an intuitive big screen experience that also incorporates the features you love about YouTube? Early on, we honed in on an interesting insight — over 80% of people said they use another digital device while watching TV. When we dug into this further, we noticed that people were not only simultaneously opening the YouTube mobile app, but were also engaging with the video (e.g. liking, subscribing) via their phones — all while playing the same video on the TV.With these insights in mind, we stopped thinking about how to fit all these features into the big screen, and instead pivoted to think about how the phone can be more deeply connected to the TV experience overall. Introducing a new way to engage with YouTube on TVStarting today, we’re rolling out a new feature that lets you effortlessly connect your TV to your iOS or Android phone, so you can dive deeper with your favorite content on YouTube while you watch on the big screen. Video format not supported To try this, your phone and TV must be signed in to the same YouTube account. Open the YouTube app on TV, then open the YouTube app on your phone, and click “Connect” on the prompt that automatically pops up.Now your phone will be synchronized to the TV, so you can directly interact with the video you are watching from the convenience of your phone. That means it’s easier than ever to read video descriptions, leave comments, share the video with a friend, or support your favorite creators by sending a Super Chat or becoming a member, all while you watch on the big screen.What’s next for YouTube on TVsThere’s much more to come as we think about the future of interactivity in the living room. With this launch, your phone becomes your all-purpose, interactive device and unlocks the ability to do more in this space.We’re already starting to test new designs for our video watch page to help fold in more uniquely YouTube features — such as browsing and shopping for products featured in videos – directly to the big screen to help you decide when to pick up your phone and engage. We’re excited to see what you think — please let us know your feedback!"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/black-music-is-every-day","date":"2022-05-31T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Music","Events","YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"Black Music Is A Movement, Not a Moment","text":"It’s been said that where words fail, music speaks.

They also talked about YouTube’s responsibility efforts throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and why our commitment to raising authoritative voices during difficult moments is more important now than ever.We’re sharing a few highlights from Neal and Emily’s conversation, and over the coming months we’ll continue to shed light into YouTube’s ongoing efforts to raise up authoritative voices and protect our community from harm. Dealing with misinformation during the war in Ukraine\"There is no responsibility more important than making sure that when people are looking for news — looking for information to protect themselves and their families — that they get high-quality, highly-credible information.” Being the last major platform available in Russia“Our first order principle is to live up to our Community Guidelines… and we have not compromised in terms of how we enforce our policies.” Dealing with COVID-19 misinformation“Our approach has been to rely as much as we can on health authorities, whether they're national health authorities — like the NIH, the CDC back in the States or the World Health Organization — as they developed their approach to things like masks, or what type of cures are harmful versus not.” An open platform with Community Guidelines“The open platform is really the power of YouTube — and we’ve always had a robust set of Community Guidelines, which we have had to evolve as YouTube has evolved.”"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-joins-the-upfronts-building-the-youtube-of-the-future-for-viewers-creators-and-advertisers","date":"2022-05-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","News & Events"],"title":"YouTube joins the Upfronts: Building the YouTube of the future for viewers, creators, and advertisers","text":"Today, viewers have more choices than ever before – there’s seemingly endless content, creators, and even platforms to choose from. And time and time again, people choose YouTube. They’re getting tips on the latest tech to buy from Marques Brownlee. They’re kicking back to watch really anything MrBeast is doing. For any need or mood, people can find content they love and trust on YouTube. So it’s no surprise that according to Nielsen, YouTube is the #1 streaming platform across all devices, reaching over 230 million people in the US in one month alone.1The digital and linear TV worlds are converging – for both viewers and advertisers. This year we joined the Upfronts for the first time, bringing together some of the biggest advertisers and agencies in the world to explore this exciting time to get the best of TV and digital on YouTube. In every viewing mode, YouTube is the Main Stream Video format not supported People still love their TVs, even if they don’t watch them in the same way. Last year, 135 million people watched YouTube on their Connected TVs (CTV), representing every age bracket from 2+, including Gen Z to 55+. Their time spent watching CTV is also increasing: According to Nielsen, YouTube has over 50% of ad-supported streaming watch time on TV screens.2On the other end, short-form content has always been a part of our DNA. We’re continuing to make short, snackable content even more accessible and helping creators reach audiences on mobile in more than 100 countries. Shorts are now averaging over 30 billion daily views, a 4X increase from a year ago.This growth is coming from viewers of all ages – and Gen Z in particular. They rank YouTube as the #1 social platform that has content they can’t get anywhere else.5 There’s maybe no better example of this new world than MrBeast: If MrBeast's YouTube channel was its own streaming service, it would have more subscribers than the next three most popular ad-supported streaming services.6 For brands and advertisers, tapping into the streaming boom is paying off As more and more brands are taking advantage of this tectonic shift, they’re seeing solid returns on their investment, including seeing YouTube outperform TV ROI head to head. In a 2020 MMM meta-analysis with Nielsen, YouTube ROI was 1.2 times greater on average than TV ROI for total CPG MMMs that measured YouTube, Other Digital, and TV.7 And that’s regardless of creative, regardless of their strategy, regardless of whether the brand is more accustomed to TV than digital.And when it comes to other digital players, YouTube ROI on average was 2.0x greater than Other OLV according to that same Nielsen study.8 Even brands who had already invested in YouTube and increased their investments are continuing to see success. In an Analytic Partner Genome study, 70% of brands saw increased ROI from YouTube after increasing investment year-over-year. These brands are making the case that if there’s ever been a time to increase investment, that time is now. Innovating to bring the best of digital to TV buyers We’ve been able to continually help brands drive results by listening to their needs and partnering to make the platform better. As it’s getting harder and harder to find scale all on one platform, reach without optimizing for frequency can lead to a lot of waste. We’ve recently announced that advertisers can control their ad frequency when they buy YouTube and 3rd party CTV programmatically through Display and Video 360.And today, we’re excited to announce our latest advancement in frequency management that goes beyond CTV. Now, you can complement your reach by actively setting your weekly frequency goal – a solution only YouTube can provide. Combining our unmatched audience reach and leading machine learning capabilities, advertisers will now be able to optimize how many times viewers see their ads in a week. Not only does this mean more efficient spend, but crucially, a better experience for viewers.In a recent partnership with Discovery+, we ran YouTube campaigns with a frequency goal to determine optimal frequency levels in driving awareness lift. Discovery saw twice the absolute awareness lift compared to past YouTube campaigns, at a similar cost compared to non frequency-optimized campaigns. This industry first will pave the way for frequency management standards across the industry.As we grow, we will continue to invest in responsibly tackling misinformation. We’re proud to be the first digital platform to be accredited for content level brand safety by the Media Rating Council two years in a row. We’re extending the rigor of our brand safety systems to our suitability solutions, helping marketers make smarter investment choices and tap into the full scale and potential of YouTube, alongside content that aligns to their distinct brand values. YouTube creators are driving the future of content The heart and soul of YouTube has always been – and will always be – its creators. Creators reach their audiences on a variety of platforms, and they continue to choose YouTube as their home. Case in point: We paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies in the three years prior to November 2020.Every time we conduct research on what viewers care about, the results come back that they want content that’s relevant to them – it’s always story over substance. And creators on YouTube have the freedom and flexibility to connect with and grow their global audiences in ways that are unique and authentic to them.To that end, today we announced new features to help creators and advertisers make more meaningful connections with their audiences. YouTube has long been an important platform in the shopping journey, and we're making it even easier for viewers to discover and buy – and for you to drive sales. Later this year, two channels will be able to go live and cohost together, uniting their communities in a single live shopping stream. And with live redirects, creators can start a shopping live stream on their channel, then redirect their audience to a brand's channel for fans to keep watching.As the heart of the creator economy, YouTube is where today’s brands are connecting with engaged audiences and driving results for their businesses.

Knowing how to start is a great first step, and that’s why we’ve partnered with NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) to offer helpful tips about discussing mental health with your community. Speak from personal experienceThe way you share your story is just as important as the experience itself. Like our physical health, everyone’s mental health situation is unique. If you’re not careful, your approach can be harmful or triggering for some of your audience.Here are some storytelling best practices you can follow to make sure you’re sharing your experience responsibly:Use phrases like “This works for me, personally” to make it clear that you’re not sharing evidence-based informationEmphasize your journey rather than the pain — share struggles, triumphs, and how you manage your mental health todaySend the message that help is always available and share reputable resources like the NAMI HelpLine at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) — open Mon-Fri from 10 am to 10 pm ET or if you are in crisis, text “NAMI” to 741-741 — available 24/7 Collaborate with expertsWorking directly with mental health professionals and nonprofits can help you share safe, credible content, and can be reliable sources for your viewers in need. Get creative with the ways you collaborate with a licensed expert, like engaging your audience in a live Q&A. Be inclusiveMental health is a spectrum that uniquely impacts us all.

But watching the tanks roll into the streets of her home country of Ukraine, she knew that she needed to do something to help. So pulling from her expertise as an oncology surgeon based at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, a member of Mass General Brigham, she set out to empower both healthcare professionals and civilians with the ability to save lives in real time.“When the war started, my husband and I brainstormed about what we could do to help. From speaking to physicians on the ground in Ukraine, we knew that there was a demand for educational materials on trauma care,” she shared. And Dr. Melnitchouk already had a head start in knowing the right way to share medical information in an accessible way to both healthcare professionals and the average Ukrainian. As founder of the non-profit Global Medical Knowledge Alliance (GMKA), for years she’d provided education on cancer care to Ukrainian physicians and patients in their local language.“I knew that access to written English-language training materials is difficult – a lot of them are behind a paywall, and many Ukrainian physicians don’t know the language,” she said. “We knew we needed to get this critical information to people quickly, in their own language, in a format that is open access and coming from sources they can trust.”Making available visual, easy-to-follow, and readily accessible information was a priority — and videos were an obvious solution. Dr. Melnitchouk partnered with her hospital colleagues, including Dr. Eric Goralnick, an emergency room physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, to develop a series of videos teaching potentially life-saving techniques: anything from how to control bleeding to responding to a hazardous attack from chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. Produced by Mass General Brigham, these videos are published in both English and Ukrainian. Training Video: How to Stop the Bleed - Навчальне Відео: Як Зупинити Кровотечу і Врятувати Життя The first video on managing a traumatic bleeding control situation even ended up helping Dr. Melnitchouk’s very own family. Her nephew in Ukraine used the training from the video to secure an injured civilian with a tourniquet. What to Do After a Hazardous Attack: CBRN Safety | Mass General Brigham The newest series of videos explain what citizens should look out for and how they should respond in the event of a chemical, biological, or radiological/nuclear (CBRN) attack. Providing step-by-step instructions, they cover how to recognize a CBRN attack, evacuation tips, and ways to decontaminate if exposed. Anybody can follow these steps — you don’t need to have any medical training — but these CBRN readiness videos can also assist public safety personnel, including clinicians, EMS, fire fighters, and law enforcement. These videos have been a joint collaboration between many experts in CBRN preparedness, toxicologists, emergency medicine, education, communications and digital media. Що робити після небезпечної атаки: Хімічна, Біологічна, Радіаційна, Ядерна безпека In the past two weeks, Mass General Brigham’s CBRN readiness videos have garnered more than 400,000 views alone.To learn more about the work of Dr. Melnitchouk and Global Medical Knowledge Alliance, please visit www.gmka.org.To learn more about Brigham and Women's Hospital, please visit Brigham and Women's HospitalFor more about other life-saving initiatives in Ukraine, Dr. Melnitchouk recommends visiting Sunflower for Peace and Razom for Ukraine."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/super-thanks-expanding-today","date":"2022-04-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"Show appreciation to your favorite creators - Super Thanks is expanding today!","text":"Super Thanks A rundown on Super Thanks and all the other ways fans can show support to their favorite creators!

We teamed up with Atlas Obscura (as well as organizations like re:wild, WWF, Conservation International, National Park Foundation and Balipara Foundation) to explore unique locations across the globe that show how incredibly rare and one-of-a-kind this planet is. “The ocean looks after us. And what a responsibility we have to look after it,” says Elayna Carausu, one-half of the vlogger duo Sailing La Vagabonde (SLV). “I think that’s probably the biggest thing I’ve learned.” Elayna and her husband Riley Whitelum use SLV to show their 1.69 million subscribers what it’s like to sail across the world, discovering — and cherishing — the planet. Sailing La Vagabonde: We Used An Entire Film Crew For This!!! | Non-Fungible Planet from YouTube We asked them, and 14 other YouTube creators, to take us with them on their journeys to better understand the stress our environment is under, and what we can do to help. SLV took us to Dean’s Blue Hole in the Bahamas, Lasizwe Dambuzae went inside the Sudwala Caves in South Africa, and ASAPScience explored a massive dune of pure gypsum in White Sands, New Mexico.You can find all these YouTube adventures on our YouTube Spotlight channel, but we also wanted to hear directly from a few creators — the Sailing La Vagabonde duo and Manual do Mundo — about what they learned in the making of these videos.Sailing La VagabondeQ: What was different about having a film crew on board with you?We live on a boat, so we live a fairly isolated life, which we really enjoy. It’s not like we never see anyone, there are other cruisers out there and especially now with the kids we try to be around civilization more but still! Having so many people onboard at once was something we’d never done. We’d never had to make coffee for a crew of 10 people up until that point. Working as a team, and not just a duo, was a big change.Q: What was the most surprising thing you learned about the Blue Hole?That acid rain played a part in the formation of the Blue Hole and blue holes in general. I didn’t know much about acid rain at all. We learned so much about acid rain and blue holes, which was fun for us. Q: What was your favorite thing about sailing through the Bahamas?We’re away from the trade winds here, the winds are much lighter year round with enough days of complete calm, so we can go freediving. The clarity of the water here is like no other place in the world. We’ve sailed tens of thousands of miles now, all through Europe, across the Atlantic four times, through the Caribbean, across the Pacific Ocean, island hopping our way all the way to New Zealand. We’re yet to find a place with better visibility.Q: What can we do to better take care of our oceans and our planet in general?Give a f$&k. If you honestly care, it will influence your friends and family to care as well. Gradually the culture around what we perceive as necessary in order to coexist with our planet in a harmonious way will change.Choosing your protein wisely (try going vegetarian or vegan)Conserve waterReduce your waste (remember the three R’s, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle)Reduce your carbon emissionsSupport sustainable brands and companiesSign petitionsBe aware of what good things are going on in your community and take partQ: If people take one thing away from this video you made, what do you hope it is?Science is cool, science is fun. I hope that to anyone who watched our video, that a spark has been lit and maybe you’re inspired to study or learn something new. Manual do MundoQ: What was the most surprising thing you learned about ?We visited a park with the largest area of preserved Atlantic Forest in Brazil. So, we got surprised, for instance, to see a clean river, which if we wanted to drink water from it, it would be possible. It is very unusual. We don't find it anymore. Here in Brazil, practically all the rivers are dirty with something.Q: What was your favorite thing about the location?An unforgettable moment was when we arrived at the mouth of the cave. We swam in the river next to a 200-meter high wall with a waterfall right in front. This landscape is totally different from what we had in mind. It felt like we were on another planet.Q: What would you tell someone before they visited?You have to prepare yourself for a heavy trail. So, if you have trouble in places like this, it's best to choose a lighter walk. We visited the viewpoint and the cave on the same day, which was even more difficult! It is also important to bring plenty of water and a light backpack. Q: What can we do to better take care of places like these and our planet in general?We must support the institution of reserves and parks that manage to control the destruction of the forest. In Brazil, for example, we have a series of challenges to be able to create parks like this.Q: If people take one thing away from this video you made, what do you hope it is?I would always remember the clean rivers we crossed. I would remember that we could have rivers like that. We would even have more water available in our city. This is a very serious problem in São Paulo, and this park is very close to there.If you’re still looking to learn more this Earth Day, check out Google Earth, where you can journey to the Akaka Falls in Hawaii with Bretman Rock or the Odeo Botanico with ItsJinaKim in Korea.

We’re adding health source information panels on videos to help viewers identify videos from authoritative sources and health content shelves that more effectively highlight videos from these sources when you search for specific health topics. These context cues are aimed at helping people more easily navigate and evaluate credible health information. People will still be able to find relevant videos from a range of channels in their search results.To identify which sources to include in our health features, we initially used a set of principles developed by a panel of experts convened by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) in the United States. As we expand these features internationally, we want to ensure a consistent set of principles to identify authoritative health sources across the globe. The World Health Organization and NAM recently convened a meeting of interdisciplinary experts from around the world to review and validate principles for global application.This is our first step towards identifying and designating authoritative health sources on YouTube. While only accredited health organizations and government entities are currently included in our health context features, we’re exploring ways to broaden eligibility and evaluate inclusion of other health sources. I believe that the next phase in health communication is video, where we can connect with people and answer their questions in a way that is both visual and personal. I’ve spent my career trying to advance the ways that we can better reach people with the information they need to make the right health choices for themselves and their families, and I’ve had a front row seat as our approaches evolved from pamphlets handed out at doctor’s offices to online patient portals and telemedicine.I believe that the next phase in health communication is video, where we can connect with people and answer their questions in a way that is both visual and personal. I joined YouTube Health because I believe that this platform, with 2 billion monthly active users, has the potential to be a transformative tool for public health and can positively impact communities at scale. We know that there is more work to be done and our investment will continue for the long-term."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/stream-full-seasons-tv-free-youtube","date":"2022-03-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube News","News & Events"],"title":"Stream full seasons of TV for free on YouTube","text":"Catching \"Hell's Kitchen\" More people are choosing to experience YouTube on the big screen with friends and family.

Today, on Safer Internet Day, we’re sharing some of the features that have resulted from this commitment to give viewers a high-quality experience. From helpful protections to easy-to-use tools, we’ve built these capabilities to give you more control of your overall YouTube experience.* Video format not supported 1. More choices for parents with kids, tweens, and teensWe know every family has a different approach to using technology, exploring online, and setting digital ground rules. So if you are a parent or caregiver, we offer options and controls to help you decide what kind of YouTube experience is best for you.If you’re a parent of younger children, you can start them off with YouTube Kids. We built YouTube Kids to create a safer environment for kids to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving parents the tools to customize the experience. We focus on including videos that are age-appropriate and high-quality on the app; you can choose from three age-based content levels (Preschool, Younger, Older) or decide to hand-pick only the videos, channels, and collections of content you want your child to watch. Video format not supported We also offer you an option if you have decided your tweens or teens are ready to explore YouTube with a supervised account. This supervised experience allows you to link your child’s Google Account to your own before choosing from three content settings (Explore, Explore more, Most of YouTube) that generally align with content ratings for pre-teens and older. We disable a number of features normally available on YouTube, like comments and live chat, as well as the abilities to create a channel, upload content, and make purchases.Break and bedtime reminders are on by default, which your kids can adjust as they learn to be mindful of healthy screen time habits. In order to better support families who explore our broad universe of videos and music in their homes, we recently extended our support for supervised accounts to YouTube Music, the YouTube app on eligible TVs, and Google Assistant-enabled speakers and displays.Quick Tip: Learn more about our dedicated experiences for families here. 2. Reminders and options to keep up with your digital wellbeingOur wellbeing features are designed to help you better understand your YouTube usage and create healthy habits, like taking time to disconnect.Our “Bedtime” or “Take a Break” Reminders, located in your Settings, can prompt you to stop watching videos for the day, either during or after video play.

Here’s how YouTube is helping make high quality health information available to everyone.","text":"Information is a key determinant of health. As anyone who has worked in public health knows, education is a core pillar of how we strive to help communities live healthier lives. The degree to which information and communication impact health outcomes has been brought into sharp view over the past two years as the world battled a misinformation epidemic alongside the COVID pandemic.That’s why the mission for YouTube is to provide equitable access to highly authoritative health information that is evidence-based and culturally relevant. We’re doing this with a focus on two key areas – information quality and information equity. People all over the world use YouTube to explore and find answers to all kinds of health questions, and they’re learning from health experts who have developed the skills to connect at scale with engaging and helpful information.Effective communication is at the heart of improving people’s health – we want people to better understand the ways that our individual and community actions impact our own health and the health of those around us. And in our increasingly digital world, the next phase in health communication is video, where we can connect with people and answer their questions in a way that is easy to understand and engaging. “ That’s why I’m thrilled to share the news that the New England Journal of Medicine has come on board as a partner of YouTube.” Equal access to high quality health informationThe massive shift towards more democratic means of mass communication, from blogging to social media to video-sharing sites like YouTube, has included health communication too. As health leaders, we have a responsibility to keep pace with these changes in where and how people find information so that we can meet people where they are and connect them with resources from credible sources.Video is a particularly effective format for sharing health information in ways that are accessible and digestible not only to a professional audience but to everyone. Regardless of your literacy level, location, or language, video is easy to understand and engaging – even on a mobile phone. As we strive to make public health information truly public, mobile video formats are a critical tool for reaching global audiences at scale and providing free and equitable access to the best and brightest thinking in science and medicine.That’s why I’m thrilled to share the news that the New England Journal of Medicine has come on board as a partner of YouTube.For more than two centuries, NEJM has been recognized for publishing gold-standard, practice-changing medical research. It has also been a cornerstone in providing equitable access to information for many years, notably by allowing online access to readers in the world’s least developed countries, by making freely available all articles of urgent public importance, and by making all research articles free six months after publication. “ Now, NEJM will take a new step forward in providing access to the best minds in medicine through their channel on YouTube.” Now, NEJM will take a new step forward in providing access to the best minds in medicine through their channel on YouTube. NEJM will share everything from Quick Takes – short video summaries of article findings and their implications – to interviews, animations, and more. Through this new partnership, the best and newest science from NEJM will be available for free to audiences around the world through easily digestible video. “Communicating rigorously vetted health information is a core part of our mission,” said Eric Rubin, M.D., Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of NEJM. “This partnership gives us the opportunity to experiment with communicating health information in new and engaging ways. We hope this channel will serve both the medical community as well as all curious and interested viewers.” “ YouTube works alongside health authorities to increase their proficiency in digital communication skills, and fosters partnerships between creative digital content creators and medical experts to reimagine how health information is shared.” Culturally relevant and credibly sourcedIt’s important that we get facts in the hands of people, but humans are not purely rational creatures. That’s why so many public health interventions also require shifts in our cultural norms and practices. 50 years ago, you could smoke cigarettes pretty much everywhere, even on airplanes and in libraries. Today, the definitive cultural shift away from ubiquitous smoking makes it striking when you see movies or TV shows set in earlier eras that show smoking in so many places we couldn’t imagine it today. There are many of these examples, from practicing safer sex methods to having children sit in car seats well through their toddler years, that have become new cultural norms in a relatively short period of time and led to improvements in public health.But shifting our health culture isn’t easy to do. When it comes to health communication, the messenger and the medium matter as much as the message itself.To help health experts make the most of what digital video can offer, YouTube works alongside health authorities to increase their proficiency in digital communication skills, and fosters partnerships between creative digital content creators and medical experts to reimagine how health information is shared.One of the newest of those partnerships is between the American Public Health Association (APHA) and Complexly, the creative educational production company started by long-time YouTube creators Hank and John Green. Through this partnership, APHA has just launched their new series, That’s Public Health, about the many ways that public health helps improve our lives. From climate change and mental health to housing and racial equity, this 20-part series will showcase the breadth and depth of public health’s role in our daily lives and how it works to keep populations healthier over the long term. The series leverages Complexly’s skills in storytelling alongside APHA's public health expertise to bring the facts to life in fun and engaging ways for learners of all levels.It’s an exciting time to be working in health communication, with more tools available than ever before to help people. The scale and reach of platforms like YouTube can radically increase equity of access to high quality health information, by breaking down barriers between the ivory towers of academia and the everyday people who want to understand how to take better care of themselves and their families. There is always more work to be done, but we hope to make a difference through our focus on information quality and equity."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/k-pop-legend-boa-and-k-pop-sensation-aespa-release-the-new-dreams-come-true","date":"2021-12-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Originals","Artists","News & Events"],"title":"K-pop legend BoA and K-pop sensation aespa release the new ‘Dreams Come True’","text":"Today, SM Entertainment and YouTube are officially releasing a YouTube Originals documentary called “Re:MASTERPIECE,” which provides a full behind-the-scenes look at the production of the LP new song, choreography and music video of the reborn K-pop masterpiece, “Dreams Come True.” SM Entertainment and YouTube launched the Remastering Project back in November, and have been remastering K-pop music videos from the ‘90s and 2000s, and introducing them to the global K-pop fans on YouTube.

Our users’ overwhelming consumption of the genre and the chart topping success of Hip Hop music videos make one thing very clear: hip-hop rules the world… imagine that?So, in this moment of firsts, we showed up. We came together and tapped in with a collection of playlists celebrating the various eras of hip-hop (‘88-’95, ‘96-’03, ‘04-’11, ‘12-’21) that all pay full musical tribute to the artists who defined these eras.In addition to honoring key artists on the cover of these playlists, we showcased billboards in New York, Atlanta, and LA, which ran for four consecutive weeks in November and featured some of the most iconic names in hip-hop: Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, Slick Rick, Biggie, Outkast, Cardi B, and many others. At the end of the day, hip-hop is about culture and we wanted to bring the culture together. So we hosted a Town Hall gathering soundtracked by the legendary DJ Premier and headlined by a Cross-generational Cultural Council featuring myself, Kevin Liles, Brandon “Jersey Jinx” Jenkins, and DJ Nyla Simone. In front of an esteemed audience, we discussed the future of celebrating the past. To us, hip-hop is something we live and breathe so every month is Hip Hop History Month.

Every day, they provide community, connection, entertainment, and new skills to a global audience of two billion fans.This creator economy only started in 2007, when YouTube began sharing revenue directly with creators through the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). Just 14 years later, there are more than two million creators around the world in YPP. YouTube’s creative ecosystem supported 142,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the EU, and the total contribution of YouTube’s creative ecosystem to the EU27 GDP was 2.38 billion. The European creator economy is a big part of this, sharing the continent’s culture, languages, and creativity with audiences around the world. To get a clearer sense of how our creative ecosystem connects with communities every day, we asked the experts at Oxford Economics to assess the impact of this new economy across the European Union (EU).The research showed that even in 2020 — against a backdrop of lockdowns and widespread economic disruption — YouTube’s creative ecosystem supported 142,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the EU. In fact, the total contribution of YouTube’s creative ecosystem to the EU27 GDP was €2.38 billion — almost as much as the EU’s generous Creative Europe fund.Behind these big numbers are the stories of people in communities across Europe, earning a living and supporting their families through this new economy.People like Jonna Jinton, who lives in the forests of Northern Sweden, posting videos of her paintings, music, and lifestyle. Jonna employs a full-time team to support the channel and virtually all of her customers come from YouTube. Through her content, Jonna has inspired many fans to travel to her home country to experience Swedish culture for themselves.Or people like German creator Sally Özcan, who turned the success of her wildly popular channel, Sallys Welt, into her own product line, cookbooks, online shop, and flagship store. Sally now employs more than 100 people. People from all backgrounds are also finding a place to belong on YouTube, seeing themselves reflected in the platform’s content. On channels like Gewitter im Kopf, friends Tim and Jan share the daily experiences of living with Tourettes. Or Belgium-based Amber Ansah who shares her journey of growing out healthy, naturally curly hair. YouTube in the EU. In the EU, over 29,000 channels have over 100,000 subscribers, an increase of over 20%, year over year. It is a new, exciting economy that’s going from strength to strength as we begin to emerge from the pandemic.This research is published as European Union policymakers finalise new rules for the internet. They are working to make it better and safer for all of us, through the new Digital Services Act (DSA).But creating these rules isn’t easy. There are some positively intended proposals that could harm the EU’s creative ecosystem.Take recommendation systems, for example. They’re the reason a lot of people discover content they love on YouTube and how creators like Sally and Jonna who make that content build an audience and earn money through the platform.Some DSA proposals would weaken recommendation systems for online platforms. Although done with the best of intentions, this will make it harder for today’s creators to earn money online and could even turn off the creators of tomorrow. It is a place where European talent of all backgrounds can find a stage, connect with fans, gain recognition, and build a business. We know that everyone involved in this debate wants Europe’s creative ecosystem to succeed and keep on growing as much as we do. After all, it is a place where European talent of all backgrounds can find a stage, connect with fans, gain recognition, and build a business. Let’s not put that at risk.There is tremendous potential for the future. If all platforms shared revenue with creators the way that YouTube does, a well-supported creator economy could rival Hollywood in economic impact and job creation, just as it does in cultural influence.This new economy of creative entrepreneurs is already enriching people’s lives across the world. Yet at just 14 years old, I feel like it’s only just getting started.Take a look at the new report to find out more about the people and the stories behind the numbers."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools","date":"2021-12-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube News","News & Events"],"title":"Access for all, a balanced ecosystem, and powerful tools","text":"Over the past few years, we’ve worked hard to build a suite of copyright management tools that gives rightsholders control of their copyrighted material on YouTube. These tools have allowed creativity to thrive, while giving creators and artists the tools and resources needed to manage their content online. Today, we’re releasing a new report, the Copyright Transparency Report, to shed more light on our copyright enforcement efforts on YouTube.Copyright management at YouTube today consists of three main tools, and we work to match rightsholders with the appropriate tool based on their specific needs and resources, while also continuously expanding features and making new investments.The public webform tool is available to everyone on our platform, and is typically accessed by rightsholders who hold limited copyrights and rarely submit takedown requests.The Copyright Match Tool supports over two million channels who may find reposted content and need to submit frequent takedown requests.And our award-winning Content ID system supports rightsholders in the most complicated rights management environments, like movie studios and music labels, who experience heavy reposting of copyrighted material. “ Through these investments in tools and underlying technologies, we’ve created a thriving ecosystem that balances the needs of creators, rightsholders, and viewers.” Through these investments in tools and underlying technologies, we’ve created a thriving ecosystem that balances the needs of creators, rightsholders, and viewers — and in doing so, we’ve helped unlock a new creative economy that has paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last three years, and more than $4 billion to the music industry since March 2020, over 30% of which has come from user-generated content.Today’s Copyright Transparency Report, which looks at data from the first half of 2021 and will be published biannually moving forward, provides new insight into how our tools operate at scale. There’s a lot of compelling information and metrics throughout, so here are a few highlights: The vast majority of claims and removal requests originated from automatic detection technology, through our Copyright Match and Content ID tools.Over 722 million claims were made through Content ID in the first half of 2021, representing over 99% of all copyright actions on YouTube, and over 1.6 million removal requests were made using the Copyright Match Tool in the first half of 2021. This chart shows unique claims or copyright removal requests made in the first half of 2021. Note that some videos may be subject to multiple claims or removal requests, such as when an individual video features more than one copyrighted asset, or multiple parties share ownership. A Content ID claim can convert to a copyright removal request at the claimant's request. In these cases, we have counted them as two separate actions: one Content ID claim and one copyright removal request. We also measure how often creators push back against removals and Content ID claims they believe are made in error.As the report notes, we see low levels of disputes relative to total claims, particularly within tools that use automatic detection. In the first half of 2021, fewer than 1% of all Content ID claims were disputed. This chart shows the total number of Content ID claims, and the proportion of those claims that are disputed by the uploader. Claimants have 30 days to review the dispute and decide whether to release the claim, uphold the claim, or issue a removal request. If they don’t respond within 30 days, the claim expires. Finally, in the limited cases where disputes arise, data from the report shows that the majority — over 60% — of resolutions are resolved in favor of the uploader. If the claimant chooses to uphold their claim or file a copyright removal request in response to a dispute, the claim is considered to have resolved in favor of the claimant. Alternatively, after receiving a dispute the claimant may choose to release the claim, or may allow the claim to expire after 30 days. In either case, the claim is removed from the video and is considered to have resolved in favor of the uploader. We are committed to making sure that YouTube remains a vibrant community with strong systems in place to enable rightsholders to manage their content on YouTube, and we look forward to the next update of the Copyright Transparency Report.Download the Copyright Transparency Report here."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/susan-joins-first-ever-codehouse-conversation","date":"2021-12-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","News & Events"],"title":"Susan joins first-ever CodeHouse conversation","text":"Two years ago, Google software engineer Ernest Holmes launched CodeHouse, a nonprofit that works to combat the diversity gap in the technology industry.

It’s a time of celebration and coming together. With antisemitism on the rise both in the United States and around the world, YouTube and Google are joining with the Anti-Defamation League as they shine a light on this concerning increase in hatred and violence, as part of our ongoing commitment to combating antisemitism both online and offline.That commitment finds many forms, from fighting hate speech online to financial support for educational and human rights organizations. We also fund the creation of original content on YouTube that helps to further racial justice and religious tolerance, and are proud to announce that the next installment of our YouTube Originals series “Recipe for Change” will premiere in Spring 2022. The series is produced by LeBron James' The SpringHill Company and will bring together Jewish creators, authors, actors, and activists. The focus of conversation is antisemitism in the U.S. as well as a celebration of Jewish food and culture. Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the CEO and National Director of the Anti-Defamation League To learn more about the Shine A Light campaign, YouTube’s Global Head of Human Rights Partnerships, Malika Saada Saar, spoke to Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the CEO and National Director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).Can you share with us what the ADL does and how it is part of a larger network of organizations addressing hate?For more than a century, ADL has worked to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all. As part of that, we’ve built a world-class team investigating extremist threats, an evil that has intensified and expanded in recent years with devastating consequences. We work closely with a number of civil and human rights organizations representing marginalized communities, among them NAACP, LULAC, the Committee of 100, GLAAD, The Asian American Foundation, the National Urban League, and many others, to coordinate our efforts to fight antisemitism, racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ bias, hate crimes, bigotry, and discrimination. We also work in close coordination with many Jewish organizations to ensure that we are securing the safety and well-being of all Jewish people in communities across the U.S.Over the past year we have seen a rise in antisemitism and antisemitic violence in the U.S. and around the world. What has the ADL been tracking, and can you give us a sense of the scope of this current challenge?Antisemitism is one of the oldest and most persistent forms of hatred. It is the proverbial canary in the coal mine, serving as a warning that other prejudices in society inevitably are not far behind when antisemitism is present. And hate is not unique to the Jewish people. As the attacks in Christchurch and Halle have demonstrated, white supremacy is a global terror threat that can explode into violence against Jews and other marginalized groups.ADL focuses most of its attention on the U.S. and the trends here are worrisome. Indeed, the number of antisemitic incidents in America has surged in recent years.According to ADL’s Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, 2019 was the worst year on record for attacks on Jews in America. We tabulated 2,107 antisemitic incidents throughout the U.S., a 12 percent increase from the 1,879 incidents recorded in 2018.Our researchers found that an additional 2,024 antisemitic incidents occurred throughout the U.S. in 2020. While this was a four percent decrease from 2019, it also was the third-highest year on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979.In the face of unprecedented attacks on the Jewish community, last year ADL conducted a survey of Jewish Americans to explore their experiences with antisemitism. It found that more than half (54 percent) of Jews in America have either experienced or witnessed some form of incident that they believed was motivated by antisemitism over the past five years.Jews also commonly encounter antisemitism online. One in seven experienced some form of harassment, and more than one in 10 have experienced a severe form of harassment such as being physically threatened as a result of their religion. We’ve also seen an increase in antisemitism in Europe, both in terms of hate incidents and anti-Jewish attitudes. As a result, more than one-third of European Jews have reportedly considered emigration because they do not feel safe in their own country.This Hanukkah, you’ve launched a new campaign called Shine A Light. Can you tell me a bit about this campaign and why you wanted to connect it with Hanukkah?In anticipation of Hanukkah, ADL has joined an unprecedented coalition of over 60 North American and Canadian Jewish and non-Jewish organizations and corporations to launch Shine A Light. This national initiative will illuminate the dangers of antisemitism through education, community partnerships, workplace engagement, and advocacy.Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a time of year when Jews celebrate the miracle of the recovery of Jerusalem and the rededication of the Second Temple during the time of the Maccabees. We light candles for each of the eight nights of the holiday, and these lights, while symbolic of the oil that lasted for eight days and eight nights after the temple’s menorah was rekindled, also have come to symbolize hope for the future and of bringing light to the world.Amid the widespread rise in antisemitism in North America, Shine A Light seeks to catalyze conversations within and across communities, on school campuses, and in the workplace, so that people will better understand what constitutes anti-Jewish hate and take steps to respond. Susan Wojcicki pledge to the Malmö International Forum YouTube and Google recently pledged to the Malmö International Forum to promote education about the Holocaust and combat antisemitism both online and offline. What are you seeing in terms of online discourse about the Holocaust and antisemitism, and does it present a different type of challenge to previous forms of denial and hate speech that took advantage of communication tools like radio?We were pleased by the commitments of YouTube, Google, and others in Malmö to promote Holocaust education and to combat antisemitism. As we have said before, these companies and their peers in Silicon Valley need to do more, so these moves are a start. They are important in terms of both preserving the memory of the six million Jews and millions of others who perished in the Holocaust and ensuring that the lessons of the Holocaust and the imperative of “Never Again,” endures for future generations.There are various strains of Holocaust trivialization and denial that remain troubling, both online and in the actual world. Online denial concerns are a serious problem on platforms. And in recent months we’ve continued to see abhorrent comparisons between government COVID-19 vaccine and mask mandates and the Holocaust. Such comparisons have no place in any political debate.One symptom of these odious and false comparisons of vaccine mandates to the Nazis is that they play into the hands of Holocaust deniers, those who promote the antisemitic notion that the Holocaust didn’t really happen or was greatly distorted by historians — something we cannot afford to tolerate. Research has shown that Holocaust denial is proliferating on social media. Twenty-three percent of respondents in a recent study said they believed the Holocaust was a myth, or had been exaggerated, or they were not sure. Nearly half reported seeing Holocaust denial or distortion posts online, and 30 percent had seen Nazi symbols on their social media platforms or in their communities.We believe the best antidote to Holocaust denial and antisemitism is education. That’s why ADL has supported legislation mandating Holocaust education in our public middle and high schools, and why we offer curriculum training and resources such as Echoes & Reflections, which we created in partnership with Yad Vashem and the USC Shoah Foundation. Every year we train thousands of teachers to use this multimedia curriculum on the Holocaust. How YouTube protects our community from hate speech Many companies are making significant commitments to addressing hate and harassment and seeking to be part of the work to make a fairer and more just world. What can YouTube and other companies do to address and disrupt the surge of anti-Semitism, both online and offline?More so than perhaps any other industry, online platforms are well positioned to take meaningful actions to prevent the spread of hate. Recently, ADL unveiled its REPAIR Plan, a comprehensive framework calling for reforms across the industry and in the laws governing the high-tech industry. Some of the priorities we identified for industry include transparency about the functions and impacts of their algorithms; establishing and enforcing anti-hate policies at scale; putting more resources towards protecting victims and targets of online harassment; countering disinformation and improving content moderation; and incorporating an “anti-hate by design” approach in the development of their products and policies.Thanks Jonathan, we appreciate the thoughtfulness that ADL has put into these recommendations, and YouTube has taken steps to ensure that promoting hateful ideologies like Naziism or denying the existence of well-documented violent events like the Holocaust have no place on our platform. Effectively combating this challenge will require a whole-of-society approach – what actions can individuals take to help Shine A Light? How should allies show up in this moment?Here’s a list of recommended actions we will be promoting during the eight nights of Hanukkah. We hope everyone will join us in helping to Shine A Light on antisemitism: Share how you #ShineALight on antisemitism on social media. Encourage your company to join the fight against antisemitism and to participate in Shine A Light.

Consumers want the convenience of researching and reviewing products online at home, but with the trusted guidance of an in-store experience. That’s where YouTube’s creators come in. They’ve committed considerable time and effort into building authentic connections with fans, and as a result, deliver trusted brand and product recommendations to their audience. In this installment of our Innovation series, our shopping team discusses how we're integrating live shopping directly into YouTube. Starting today, YouTube is launching a new way for you to connect with your favorite creators. This week, the YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop will feature creators including The Merrell Twins, Simply Nailogical, Donut Media, Gordon Ramsay, Patrick Starrr, Jackie Aina, Manny MUA, and MrBeast hosting shoppable livestreams — featuring exclusive access to new products, exciting giveaways, exclusive discounts, and more. We’re also introducing YouTube.com/Shopping as a temporary destination for these livestreams.We sat down with our shopping team to discuss some of the considerations for building live shopping and what viewers can expect.Q: Why did YouTube decide to jump into live shopping?Wendy Yang, Product Designer, YouTube Shopping: Live shopping is an area we’re really excited about and is a huge opportunity. The exciting thing about live shopping, and shopping generally, is that we’re already seeing it happen on YouTube — with creators revealing a product line, dropping new merch, or discussing their latest shopping haul. People want to shop on YouTube and, according to a study we ran in partnership with Publicis and TalkShoppe, 89% of viewers agree that YouTube creators give recommendations they can trust. We can make it easier to shop by integrating it directly into YouTube, removing steps in this process, and making the entire shopping experience fun and interactive for our users.Q: What are the challenges with building a live shopping experience on YouTube?Lax Poojary, Product Manager, YouTube Shopping: When we set out to build a live shopping experience on YouTube, we wanted to let viewers discover new and relevant products through the guidance of their trusted creators. We wanted to build features that allow for interactive and immersive exchanges between viewers and creators, so that the buying experience is engaging and fun. But we also needed the experience to allow for shopping while making sure that the livestream is uninterrupted.Wendy: We built the shopping features so that you can easily learn about products in the video or discover new products that you might love. In our research, we found that 87% of people say they get the highest quality information about products when shopping or browsing on YouTube. If you want to buy, you can make purchases using onsite check out or at retailers' sites. That means the video stream is uninterrupted, so that you never miss a moment. Q: What are some of the features you’re most excited about?Lax: We want to bring you closer to your favorite creators and make these livestreams interactive between creators and fans. Creators can offer their audience live product drops, exclusive discounts, and even poll fans during their shopping livestreams to interact with and get feedback from their fans.For example, you can imagine a creator polling their audience on what product they want to see next in the livestream or getting real time feedback on designs their audience likes best. We are working on an exciting roadmap that brings together entertainment and shopping in one place.Q: What goes into hosting a shoppable livestream?Lax: The team has been working really hard on making live shopping a reality for our creators and providing a great viewer experience as well. For the YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop event, our creators are leveraging platforms like Shopify to power their stores, making it easy for their viewers to discover their products, build deeper relationships with their brands, and easily make purchases. Some are using interactive production companies like Stage TEN to take their content to the next level. Once the store is connected to their YouTube channel, creators can tag their favorite products and set up a live shopping stream. Creators can even add a trailer to their upcoming live event watchpage to stimulate users to set reminders.Our ultimate goal is to build a platform that allows anyone with a mobile device and a product to easily host a live shopping stream, but these early events will tell us a lot about what that looks like. Q: Talk more about YouTube.com/Shopping and what people can find there.Wendy: We created YouTube.com/Shopping as a temporary destination that allows you to revisit livestreams, discover new ones, and browse products shown in the videos in categories such as makeup, skincare, haircare, and electronics. You can also explore featured gifts from brand and creator stores along with the top trending gift ideas from Google shopping. Through our survey, we found that 75% of shoppers agree that YouTube enhances the traditional shopping journey by delivering unexpected inspiration. At YouTube.com/Shopping, you can browse trailers to upcoming shopping livestreams and set notifications for any livestreams that strike your interest.Q: What do you hope to learn from the Stream and Shop events?Lax: Our week-long YouTube Holiday Stream & Shop event introduces a new way of shopping on YouTube that allows you to discover, consider, and buy the products recommended by your favorite creators. This event is going to tell us a lot about live shopping on YouTube and help us understand what users most want to see in shoppable streams and what features creators and brands find most useful.Wendy: Heading into 2022, YouTube will continue building and investing in shopping, including features for video on demand and personalized shopping. We’ll continue learning through these events and experimenting with new formats. In fact, on November 17, we will premiere a new shoppable film featuring products from Black-owned businesses that you can purchase. Our goal is to create a fun and compelling shopping experience for our viewers that addresses the growing demand for social e-commerce while strengthening the unique relationship YouTube creators have with their fans.Visit YouTube.com/Shopping to discover our shoppable live streams — we can’t wait to share them with you!"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/cleaning-ocean-teamseas","date":"2021-11-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","News & Events"],"title":"Cleaning the ocean with #TeamSeas","text":"MrBeast, Mark Rober, and thousands of their fellow YouTube creators have joined together to remove tons of trash from the ocean.

To ensure that YouTube promotes respectful interactions between viewers and creators, we introduced several features and policies to improve their experience. And earlier this year, we experimented with the dislike button to see whether or not changes could help better protect our creators from harassment, and reduce dislike attacks — where people work to drive up the number of dislikes on a creator’s videos. We're making the dislike counts private across YouTube, but the dislike button is not going away. This change will start gradually rolling out today. As part of this experiment, viewers could still see and use the dislike button. But because the count was not visible to them, we found that they were less likely to target a video’s dislike button to drive up the count. In short, our experiment data showed a reduction in dislike attacking behavior1. We also heard directly from smaller creators and those just getting started that they are unfairly targeted by this behavior — and our experiment confirmed that this does occur at a higher proportion on smaller channels.Based on what we learned, we're making the dislike counts private across YouTube, but the dislike button is not going away. This change will start gradually rolling out today. What’s changing for creators and viewers starting todayCreators will still be able to find their exact dislike counts in YouTube Studio, along with other existing metrics, if they would like to understand how their content is performing. We want to create an inclusive and respectful environment where creators have the opportunity to succeed and feel safe to express themselves. Viewers can still dislike videos to tune their recommendations and privately share feedback with creators.We heard during the experiment that some of you have used the public dislike count to help decide whether or not to watch a video. We know that you might not agree with this decision, but we believe that this is the right thing to do for the platform.We want to create an inclusive and respectful environment where creators have the opportunity to succeed and feel safe to express themselves. This is just one of many steps we are taking to continue to protect creators from harassment.

COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on mental well-being around the world, with increased incidence of mental health issues from anxiety, depression and stress, to substance use and self-harm. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, during the pandemic about 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. have reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder.Mental health issues can be debilitating and isolating, leaving you feeling like you don't know who to turn to, or that there isn't anyone who can understand what you are going through. The prospect of asking for help and exposing deeply personal experiences can further heighten the distress people feel in the moments when they most need help. “ It’s so important to send the message to more people that they are not alone, and that if you're feeling depressed, lonely, or in crisis, there is someone on the other side of the phone to speak with.” I’ve seen this firsthand through my work as a mental health hotline volunteer counselor. Over the past year, the volume of calls handled by our center has increased as people look for help to cope. And undoubtedly there are so many more people who need help but don’t know where to turn. That’s why it’s so important to send the message to more people that they are not alone, and that if you're feeling depressed, lonely, or in crisis, there is someone on the other side of the phone to speak with.In my role at YouTube, my team builds products that help viewers navigate their health questions and interests online and discover credible and engaging video content. YouTube has shown crisis resource panels on sensitive search queries for many years, to connect people directly with organizations that are local, free, and confidential, to help them get through a moment of critical need. As I've experienced as a volunteer counselor time and time again, picking up the phone and asking for help can be scary and hard. We wanted to understand if there were ways to make it easier, and to communicate to our viewers that asking for help is okay and that we all need support from time to time. We have built out a number of updates to our crisis response panels to better connect with people, which will be rolling out in the coming weeks. Increasing visibility of crisis resource panelsGrowing up, I remember seeing hotline numbers on the doors of bathroom stalls and in bus stations. We’ve come a long way since then and many of these public spaces have moved online, especially during the pandemic, and that’s where we need to meet people.Previously, YouTube’s crisis resource panels only appeared in search results. We’re now expanding them to show on the Watch Page as well, right under the video title. The Watch Page is where people spend most of their time on YouTube, which means a big increase in the visibility of these messages. The panels appear on the Watch Page below videos whose content is about suicide and self-harm, delivering a powerful combination of educational and emotionally resonant content alongside prompts to take action if needed.Normalize getting helpEveryone needs help now and then. We wanted to make sure that the language and design in our panels reflect that. The new language emphasizes that services are free, confidential and available 24/7, and offers resources to call or chat a local support line.Creators are important voices in the conversation about mental health, whether through sharing their own personal stories about managing or coping with a mental illness, or through helping to normalize talking about mental health and seeking help. We provide space for creators to talk about these issues, however we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or is intended to shock or disgust users, and we remove that content. Show up across a broad range of topicsPreviously, YouTube’s crisis resource panels only appeared next to searches related to suicide and self-harm. However, supporting our viewers’ mental health and wellbeing goes far beyond these issues. In fact, concerns like anxiety and depression are incredibly common and more than 50% of Americans will encounter some form of mental health disorder in their lifetime. To meet that need, in the US we are expanding the range of topics that display crisis resources in YouTube search results to issues like depression, sexual assault, substance abuse and eating disorders. This will ramp up in the US in the coming weeks, and we are working on rolling these changes out internationally in the coming months. We believe that connecting viewers to resources is incredibly important across the spectrum of mental health issues. “ YouTube has always been a place where people can connect with others over shared experiences. It’s also a place where people come to learn and ask questions. That’s why mental health is a critical part of our health mission.” YouTube has always been a place where people can connect with others over shared experiences. It’s also a place where people come to learn and ask questions. That’s why mental health is a critical part of our health mission — we want you to be able to find the information you need when you need it, whether that is immediate support in a crisis, educational content about your condition, or long-term coping strategies and personal stories of others.Managing depression, anxiety and substance abuse can be lonely and isolating, whether you are experiencing these challenges yourself or supporting a loved one. You are not alone. If you or a loved one are struggling, there is help available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.In the United States, you can get in touch with the Lifeline by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or using the web chat service.

It’s not about ticking diversity boxes. This is where we see the future growth of our platform.Our viewers are more diverse than ever, and they want to use their voices for racial justice, the climate, and mental health. They expect us to take brave stands on these issues with them. The challenge for us is how do we ensure that we show up for all of our viewers in the ways they care about?Mistakes are inevitable. I’ve made many. And audiences really let you know about it. But I firmly believe that the best thing to do is share what we learn with others who are also on this journey, and keep trying to be better. Because we must. “ The opportunity we all have is to make this a more inclusive world and to hold ourselves accountable to that. I think the most important thing we can do as an industry is to be humble and keep learning, and we’ve got to share stories and learn together.” In this video, I share three key lessons from my experience as the CMO of YouTube rethinking inclusion in our work and on the platform.Visibility ≄ inclusivity. The easiest thing we can do is to simply show a range of faces and body types in our content. But, you can’t simply put diverse images in an ad. Truly inclusive work comes from telling authentic stories that challenge stereotypes and honor the lived experiences of the audiences we are focusing on.Listen more. The best way you can honor your customers and be truly inclusive is by listening to as many voices as you can. This has to be intentful and methodical, and is forever work. It can't just happen as you are testing ads. You will be surprised at what you learn and the amazing insights it gives you into your brand.Change takes more than a marketing campaign. To truly welcome people into the door of your brand, you have to think through your inclusive business policies end to end. It is our job as marketers to understand the integrity of that story. A campaign is not enough.The opportunity we all have is to make this a more inclusive world and to hold ourselves accountable to that. I think the most important thing we can do as an industry is to be humble and keep learning, and we’ve got to share stories and learn together."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/education-and-inspiration-more-sustainable-world","date":"2021-10-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","News & Events"],"title":"Education and inspiration for a more sustainable world","text":"YouTube has always been a place where people come to learn, connect, and create. Over the last few years, we’ve seen an increasing number of people and creators turning to YouTube to convene and converse about climate science and sustainable living. We are proud to be a place where millions of people can learn and find inspiration about how to support a more sustainable world.From exploring how to reduce individual waste, grow our own food, or even go thrifting, people all over the world are turning to YouTube to educate themselves about making more thoughtful decisions and adopting a sustainable lifestyle. For example, global views on videos about upcycling grew over 50% in 2020, while views of videos related to permaculture or zero waste were viewed over 50 million times in France alone. In Germany, YouTopia was livestreamed over 5 days and saw more than 40 creators, celebrities, and politicians coming together for a more sustainable future. Communities are coming together on YouTube to share knowledge covering a wide range of topics related to sustainability. Educators from all over the world help us to understand the science behind climate change, while farmers give us a detailed look into how farms work and where our food comes from. In fact, videos from FarmTubers had 3 billion views globally in 2020.We’re also seeing how creators around the world are collaborating to make a difference on climate change. In Europe, creators are bringing together experts, celebrities, and policy-makers for YouTopia, a series of multi-day charity livestreams where creators live together and share their stories about sustainability from bubble domes across the continent. This year’s edition in Germany had 1 million viewers and raised more than $200,000 USD in donations. Starting November 4th, YouTopia will take place for the first time in France. YouTube is helping make this year’s UN Climate Conference accessible to everyone. Experts from authoritative voices like UN Climate, UNICEF, World Wildlife Fund, and European Climate Foundation among others are also playing an important role in informing viewers about climate science and inspiring action on the platform. YouTube is working closely with the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) organizers, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UK government, to ensure the activities at COP are available on YouTube. As COP26 kicks off in Glasgow, creators Jack Harries, Sejal Kumar, Brave Wilderness, Physics Girl, Alicia Joe, and Biologia Total will be onsite, helping to make this year’s climate conference accessible to everyone. These creators will participate in interviews, panels, and screenings, and engage their audiences to take action on the climate crisis. You can also follow along through the official COP26 livestream on YouTube.Powerful storytelling to drive changeAs a content platform, we believe we can contribute and drive change by doing what we know best: partnering with creators, organizations, and media companies to use the power of storytelling to continue to educate users on the sustainability challenges the world faces and inspire climate action.That is why we’ve invested significantly in the development of new, original programming to drive awareness, conversation, and action around climate change and sustainable living. In the lead up to COP26, we’re rolling out several new YouTube Originals projects to educate, entertain, and inspire everyone to create a more sustainable planet.Here are the shows that will be available for free, for everyone: CEO of Google Sundar Pichai talks with Kermit the Frog about \"Dear Earth.\" Dear Earth, a special event that inspires viewers to join the sustainability movement. Featuring an opening address from Kermit the Frog, keynote addresses from leaders like President Barack Obama, a keynote address and performance by KPOP supergroup BLACKPINK, and dramatic feats by pro cyclist Danny MacAskill and skier JT Holmes that bring to life the realities of climate change, as well as creators like Dream, ZHC, and Odd1sOut sharing practical ways to get involved and make a difference, and much more. Climate Change affects us all... even SpongeBob SquarePants who also joins \"Dear Earth\" to give a special performance.Climate Games demonstrates the scale of climate change with spectacular challenges by creators and elite athletes. Skier JT Holmes and Physics Girl show us how quickly the ice is melting on the snowy mountains of British Columbia, and pro cyclist Danny MacAskill demonstrates what percentage of the world's energy currently comes from renewable sources. We’re taking AsapSCIENCE out of the classroom and into the country where we’ll be living completely off the grid. Shut It Off ASAP takes AsapSCIENCE creators Mitchell Moffitt and Gregory Brown to a remote farm where they try their hand at turning off access to basic needs like food, power, and water to find sustainable alternatives. FarmTubers, First Nations guides, and experts will join them to help execute a vision of living completely off the grid and deliver takeaways that can be replicated back at home.Seat at the Table follows Jack Harries throughout a 100-day trip across the UK to uncover the often overlooked voices of young people whose lives are being most affected by the climate crisis. The series also features appearances from key voices on the subject, including Sir David Attenborough, Jane Goodall, and Simon Amstell, alongside YouTube creators Jamal Edwards and Rachel Ama. Jack will present the film to world leaders at COP26 in Glasgow. Brave Wilderness host, Mark Vins, is on a mission to search for some of the last remaining Mountain Gorillas in Virunga National Park. Brave Mission: Rewild the Planet is an edge-of-your seat global expedition led by Mark Vins of Brave Wilderness, featuring hands-on experiences with the planet’s most breathtaking endangered species and the local guardians who sacrifice everything in the battle to save them and the ecosystems they call home.SiGNALS is the abridged story of our relationship with plastic—from the origins and lifecycle of a plastic bottle to the myths of recycling. It is a live-action and animation mashup, told through a series of chapters produced by artists and activists from around the world.YouTube Originals Presents: TED Countdown is a free, empowering, global event laying out a credible and realistic pathway to a net-zero future. Join us on TED’s YouTube channel at 12pm ET on October 30 for TED Talks, music, short films, and animation focused on climate solutions and justice. We take our responsibility for the planet seriouslySolving the challenge of climate misinformation is a shared responsibility that requires a “whole of society” approach, and there is more we still need to do.At YouTube, we invest significantly to raise up authoritative information, amplify educational and scientific voices on our platform —like the ones from TED, Global Citizen, and several global NGOs, creators and educators— and reduce borderline content to prevent the spread of climate misinformation. “ We are proud to be a place where millions of people can learn and be inspired about how to support a more sustainable world.” We also recently announced a new ads and monetization policy that reduces incentives for climate change denial that apply to all Google ads, publisher content, and YouTube creators who monetize via our YouTube Partner Program. This is the first such commitment from an advertising platform, and we hope others will follow our lead.In addition to the content on our platform, we are also committed to managing our own carbon footprint as a company. Google was the first major company to become carbon neutral in 2007 and for over a decade we have procured renewable energy or offset the emissions associated with our data centers that deliver billions of hours of YouTube videos.We are proud to be a place where millions of people can learn and be inspired about how to support a more sustainable world. And we’ll continue to use the power of storytelling to help educate and inspire our 2 billion users to make environmentally friendly choices in their daily lives, in line with Google’s sustainability pledge."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-responsibility-approach-protecting-kids-and-families-youtube","date":"2021-10-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"Our responsibility approach to protecting kids and families on YouTube","text":"When I tell people that I work at YouTube, I often hear stories about how their families come to YouTube to learn something new, do yoga, draw and cook together. As kids and teens spend more time online, it’s important to protect their experience while encouraging exploration. Responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and nothing is more important than protecting kids. For our younger users, we’ve built a dedicated kids destination, the YouTube Kids app. We’ve invested heavily over the years to make YouTube Kids a safer, family-friendly place for kids to explore their imagination and curiosity. We have a higher bar for which videos can be a part of the app and also empower parents to control what content their child can and cannot see.But we also give parents options on the main YouTube experience, including the ability to create a supervised account for their tween or watch together with their kids. Today, we wanted to give you an overview of the approach we take in protecting kids and families on YouTube.This work builds on the framework we use across YouTube to live up to our responsibility as an open platform while protecting the YouTube community. Our principles are organized around the four “Rs”: remove harmful content, raise authoritative voices, reduce borderline content, and reward trusted creators. We apply these pillars across a range of content, from elections to misinformation, and they also ground our efforts to protect kids and families. This work complements our existing safety and digital wellbeing options and privacy and data practices for children’s content. Here’s how:RemoveWe have clear policies that prohibit content that exploits or endangers minors on YouTube and have committed significant time and resources toward removing violative content as quickly as possible. We also regularly review these policies and engage with external experts to ensure they are current. For example, we’ve updated our policy to cover content meant to target young minors and families that contains sexual themes, violence, obscenity, or other mature themes. In Q2 of 2021 alone, we removed over 1.8 million videos for violations of our child safety policies.YouTube Kids is a separate app that is a filtered version of YouTube, has specific content policies and a much smaller set of channels and videos available. Over the years, we’ve raised the bar for which channels and videos can be a part of YouTube Kids, drastically reducing the number of channels on the app. For example, we’ve recently updated our policies to remove overly commercial content from YouTube Kids, such as videos that only focus on product packaging or directly encourage children to spend money.Raise & ReduceOver the last few years, we’ve been working to implement products and policies that help us connect families with high-quality content on YouTube and YouTube Kids. In collaboration with child development specialists, we established a set of quality principles to help guide our kids and family creator ecosystem. Age-appropriate, enriching, and engaging content can come in different formats, genres and cover a range of topics. They include videos that inspire curiosity and imagination, celebrate diverse perspectives and encourage kids to uncover their own interests and passions.These principles help determine inclusion in YouTube Kids and how recommendations work in the main YouTube experience. On YouTube Kids, we identify and include videos and channels that are age-appropriate and adhere to the quality principles. We also use these principles to determine which high-quality content we raise up in our recommendations on YouTube. This means that when you’re watching “made for kids” content on YouTube, we aim to recommend videos that are age-appropriate, educational, and inspire creativity and imagination. For example, if you were watching SciShow Kids’ How do Rockets Fly, we could recommend content like Art for Kids Hub’s How to Draw a Rocket, Super Sema’s How To Make A DIY CD Hovercraft or GoldieBlox's STEM Curiosity Camp. At the same time, we use these principles to reduce kids content that is low-quality (but doesn’t violate our Community Guidelines) in our recommendations on YouTube, and remove channels from YouTube Kids. Examples of this content include videos that are heavily commercial or promotional, encourage negative behaviors or attitudes, and more. Our work here is ongoing and we regularly reevaluate and update these principles. You can read more here.RewardThere is a vibrant community of kids and family content creators that produce high-quality content. And we want to make sure that we’re rewarding these creators and helping them grow and succeed on YouTube.We set a higher bar for what channels can make money on YouTube. In addition to our Community Guidelines, creators also need to follow our monetization policies to join the YouTube Partner Program. Every channel applying to YPP undergoes review by a trained rater to make sure it meets our policies and we continually keep these guidelines current. We also regularly review and remove channels that don’t comply with our policies.Earlier this month, we shared additional monetization policies—which align with the quality principles discussed above—for channels that primarily create kids and family content on YouTube. Going forward, these principles will have not only an impact on recommendations and inclusion in YouTube Kids, but also on monetization.Channels that primarily target young audiences or are classified as “made for kids” will need to deliver high-quality content and comply with kids-specific monetization policies. For example, channels that have predominantly low-quality kids content, such as “Heavily commercial or promotional” or “Encouraging negative behaviors or attitudes”, may be suspended from YPP. And if an individual video violates these quality principles, it may see limited or no ads.We have reached out to potentially impacted creators in order to support them before these changes take effect starting next month. Our ultimate goal is to foster a safe and enriching environment for families while rewarding trusted creators who are making high-quality kids and family content.We are proud of the incredible creators who are delivering enriching and diverse content for people across the globe. We’re committed to helping them succeed, while providing kids and families with a safer and enriching experience. Our work here is ongoing, and we appreciate the partnership of parents, creators and experts in this journey."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/meet-youtubeblack-voices-music-class-2022","date":"2021-10-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"Meet The #YouTubeBlack Voices Music Class of 2022","text":"Earlier this year, we introduced the inaugural #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund Artist Class of 2021.

I have a passion for writing songs and desire to say something through my craft. I see the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund availing my work and brand to a bigger audience and platform, which means more exposure and opportunities for my career. ” Barkaa - King Brown (Official Video) BarkaaBarkindji Nation, Western NSWBarkaa: “My music talks about the injustice of First Nations people here in so-called Australia and the impacts colonization has on my family and myself. It’s all about empowering my First Nations community, especially my sisters who are underrepresented in the hip hop scene here. This opportunity gives me the ability to take my vision to a whole other level, and I’m thankful that this will help bring my vision to life. I have a story to tell. This helps me paint that picture.” Blanco Brown - Nobody’s More Country (Lyric Video) Blanco BrownAtlanta, Georgia, United StatesBlanco Brown: “As an adult, I never really wanted to be an artist. But I got tired of selling my songs and hearing artists make up their own conclusions to my lyrics which meant something different to me, so I decided to express them vocally myself. That way I control the narrative. My music speaks to all generations! I would describe it as a familiar sound with a twist. Trailer park music, which is muddy country in my mind, meets trap music, which has 808’s, snares, and high hats in double time. I call it TrailerTrap. I feel that at times I work so hard and spread so much love that I forget to promote myself because this life isn’t about me! It’s such a blessing to have the opportunity for a major platform to support your purpose!” Bree Runway - HOT HOT Bree RunwayEast London, England, United KingdomBree Runway: “There is a huge gap in the market for Black pop stars, for edgy Black women who are genre-less and are just popping. I’m that girl, and I'd like to continue to solidify my spot in the industry as that girl. My music is explosive, packed with confidence and sass. On the flip side, there are hints of the emotional to and fros that we as humans go through. It’s genre bending. Sonically there is no limit for me. All my releases have something completely different to offer. It’s what keeps the Bree Runway sound fresh and exciting. I think this is a great opportunity to collaborate with some creatives that I've always wanted to work with to help elevate my content. Fire content goes hand in hand.” Budjerah - Talk (feat. MAY-A) [Official Video] BudjerahFingal Head, AustraliaBudjerah: “The main reason I’m an artist is purely because I love to sing. I love music and singing so much that I don’t think I could do anything else. My inspiration comes from my family. They’re musicians who played a lot in church when I was growing up. Watching them really shaped a lot of my musical habits. I try to be honest in my music so everything I write comes from a story that’s happened to me. I really like to dump all my emotions into the music. I see the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund as an amazing opportunity, and I’m really grateful for it. I think it’ll help me reach more people around the world, which would be amazing.” Cico P - Tampa (Official Music Video) \"That boy bad news he a menace to society\" Cico PJacksonville, Texas, United StatesCico P: “My sound is what East Texas is all about — hustling, grinding, and making things happen for yourself. Everything about me is East Texas: the way I walk, talk, and make music. We're just different down here, and it's time the world knows. There's so much talent all over the state, but people usually only hear about Houston and Dallas rappers. I see the #YouTubeBlack Voices fund elevating my career in ways I would have never imagined. Providing me with resources and education on how to maximize everything I am doing is going to be a game changer in the long term. Being a part of this awesome program allows me to share my music globally, while shedding a spotlight on all the talented people in East Texas. Without this opportunity, that spotlight would not have been there, so I am grateful to YouTube for acknowledging our talent down here as well.” Cimafunk - Caramelo (Official Music Video) CimafunkPinar del Rio, CubaCimafunk: “My lyrics have a lot of the Cuban sayings, the slang, the flavor, and reflect the way we as Cubans communicate in a relaxed, care-free way. You can see my identity reflected not only in my sound, but in the way I present myself and my work visually. The clothes, the looks, everything is connected to my roots. The flared pants, the platform shoes, the African print shirt, and also when I wear a more modern take on a guayabera — a shirt that is the Cuban national garment. I believe that the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will also give visibility to and push the message of Black pride and Black awareness to more people: this feeling of being proud of who you are, feeling good about yourself, of embracing oneself and accepting how you are, accepting and being happy about being Black.” CKay - Felony (Official Music Video) CKayAnambra, NigeriaCKay: “My earliest contact with music was through my father, who was a choir conductor in a church. I decided to start writing my own music with the piano and guitar. That knowledge of instruments and digital production is an integral part of my music-making process. My traditional South-Eastern origin explains my use of Igbo language in my music as well as my extensive knowledge of highlife music.” Dijon - Bad Luck (Official Video) DijonEllicott City, Maryland, United StatesDijon: “I think my music sounds like the open exchange of ideas, or maybe a fishing trip with friends. I just want to find new ways to describe universal things so seeing and hearing things around informs my work more than anything else. Working visually is something I’ve only done in moderation. So I see the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund helping contribute to telling some of these stories in different avenues.” Elaine - Right Now (Official Video) ElainePretoria, South AfricaElaine: “My music is a warm, honest, and pure representation of who I am — a hopeless romantic. I became an artist because of my love for R&B and the iconic Black women such as Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, Lebo Mathosa, and Brenda Fassie. My dad also played a huge role in my love and admiration for music. I’m constantly inspired by my experiences and my deep love for turning my feelings into art. The Fund will give me — a Black South African girl — the platform to be heard, seen, and celebrated on a global stage.” EST Gee - 5500 Degrees (feat. Lil Baby, 42 Dugg, Rylo Rodriguez) [Official Music Video] EST GeeLouisville, Kentucky, United StatesEST Gee: “My music is just that energy and the vision of the island ‘Louisville, KY’ where I’m from. It’s a vivid picture of what’s going on in my city and every other city in the world. I’m a street artist, so I’m giving you real street stories and giving you a different perspective on how I see it. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will allow me to create more content, get more creative with the content I present on YouTube, and help grow the EST brand as well as the artists signed under that brand.” Jonathan Ferr - Saturno Jonathan FerrRio de Janeiro, BrazilJonathan Ferr: “I describe my music as medicine music. I make music for the listener to take deep journeys into themselves. I mix jazz, hip-hop, Brazilian electronic music, classical, and other things, and I call it URBAN JAZZ. My parents influenced me a lot. Despite them not being musicians, music has always been present in my life. I remember when I was little, my parents would watch a pianist's TV show, and I would be between them receiving love and affection while listening to jazz classics. It was there that I fell in love with the piano. What inspires me is everything I hear, everything I like to see. Movies inspire me, meditating inspires me, everything beautiful inspires me. As far as the Fund, I believe I will have more opportunities to amplify my voice on the biggest platform in the world. I believe in the power of art, and this program will be a powerful ally to broaden my career and also amplify the voices of the Black community. One voice speaks for many voices.” Jords, D Double E, Izzy Bizu - Old School Flex (Official Video) JordsCroydon, England, United KingdomJords: “My music is a shapeshifting, musical backdrop with rap at its core. Global but local! My earliest influence in music would be Wretch 32, Ghetts, Stevie Wonder, and Lauryn Hill. I started making music because it felt like a place where I could truly be myself. My identity is central to my work. Everything I do is because of who I am, who my ancestors are, and the community that surrounds me. I believe #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will definitely be a massive elevation for my career. It just opens a lot of doors for myself and the people around me, and will help me a lot with my mission.” Kadhja Bonet - 'For You' (Official Audio) Kadhja BonetLong Beach, California, United StatesKadhja Bonet: “My decision to become a musical artist kind of blindsided me. I was in college studying film and feeling discouraged. I borrowed a friend’s guitar and instantly became addicted. I had to take a leave from school to get to know the instrument because I didn't want to think about anything else. After that I was resolute. Music has given me the space to experiment with my thoughts and self awareness, and challenge social constructs. I am so stoked to have been selected for the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund. I am planning to use these funds to create projects that contribute positively to Black culture and define my own form of activism. I intend to bridge my interests in music and film/TV, and invest in projects that will create long-lasting impressions and longevity for my career.” KAMILLE - Sad Party (feat. Haile & Ivorian Doll) (Official Video) KamilleLondon, England, United KingdomKamille: “My music is honest, melodic, empowering, super creative, and always tells a story. I’m a songwriter at heart, and I love telling a story through everything I do. A strong beat and iconic melody always lies at the center of my songs. As a Black Caribbean woman, my identity is everything. There’s a raw, unapologetic truth to the things I say, which is something I can only put down to the empowering way I was raised and the role models I had. Standing up for myself and being heard was a must for me growing up and still is now. I’m so grateful for this opportunity as it will allow me to fully capitalize on the platform’s capabilities and tools to help ensure moments of higher engagement and growth from fans and audiences that are invested into the #YouTube Black Voices campaign and what it represents!” Liniker - Psiu LinikerSão Paulo, BrazilLiniker: “My music follows passion and the heart. These characteristics have put me in direct contact with what I feel and believe. My work takes place in a market in Brazil where music has been made and built independently and very collectively. In this way, I would say that my art and my music are communication tools for what we are living here and now. It is an immense joy that I have been selected for the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund because this is a way to be able to direct my narrative and my platform to the world, to make my work connect with anyone available to listen and relate to what I have produced — an artist, a Black woman whose goal is that freedom be a present and ever-expanding place so that our stories are preserved in the now and our voices continue to echo.” Liza - ROLLA (Official Video) LizaToronto, CanadaLiza: “My dad got me my first karaoke machine when I was four years old and I was inseparable. I knew I wanted to write music and tell stories when I was seven or eight and first heard “If I Ain’t Got You” by Alicia Keys. I always knew music was it for me. It was my ultimate form of expression. I don’t think becoming an artist was really a decision. It was more of a calling; this is what I’m meant to do with my life. Everything I create is a product of who I am and my experiences. The art I create is inspired by the Black artists that came before me. I’m so grateful to come from a culture that carries so much depth and history, where the historical pain and trauma was used to create something beautiful through artistic expression. I see #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund impacting my career by providing me with resources to grow and share my work with a wider audience. Having the support of YouTube to amplify my existing platform, while also gaining access to programs to further my artistry, will only contribute to my growth as an artist and creator.” midwxst - Tic Tac Toe [Dir. by @DotComNirvan] MidwxstCarmel, Indiana, United StatesMidwxst: “My music can be described as a peek into the everyday thoughts and actions of an anxious and self-conscious teenager who has an occasional boost of confidence in himself. I find it challenging at times to tell people about my problems. So I speak to my microphone instead. The ability to impact other people's lives and use my music as a tool of healing and relatability is the main inspiration behind my music. I talk about a lot of things that have happened to me personally with the hope that someone who has also endured similar experiences can relate and understand it to the same extent I do. The Fund will enable me to further cement myself in the musical and cultural space as an artist who doesn't only care about making music but also inspiring others to believe in themselves. I have a unique opportunity to leverage my platform to educate and build awareness about other topics such as mental health across all communities — especially for young boys and men who look like me.” Monaleo - Beating Down Yo Block (Official Music Video) MonaleoHouston, Texas, United StatesMonaleo: “I would describe my music as unapologetic, vulgar, raunchy, and just free-spirited. I feel like Black culture in general inspires my sound and my lyrics. Also certain experiences inspire my lyrics, too. Most of the time my lyrics are based on situations that I am actually going through. I feel like that is what really influences my music. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will impact my career because as an independent artist, the majority of the time the things we have to worry about are how we are going to get the funds to really bring our vision and creativity to life? It will help me really show my true creativity and have the resources I need for a successful career.” Nija - Ease My Mind (Come Over) [Official Video] NijaUnion, New Jersey, United StatesNija: “Beyoncé influenced my decision to become an artist. I worked with her as a songwriter, and she told me that I had the best tone in the world and shortly afterwards featured me on her song \"My Power.\" I would say that she 100 percent inspires me and my music just by being the strong, Black, hardworking woman she is. I'm also inspired by life as a whole and experiencing new things at a new level. I see #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund impacting my career in a major way. It is an opportunity to get my creative vision off and also connect with my fans on a deeper level. I started off my career as a songwriter. I’ll always be a songwriter, but I’m really excited that this fund allows me to show people a bit more of who I am by pushing not only my personality but personal experiences to the forefront.” NorthSideBenji x DJ Charlie B - 30,000 ft (Official Music Video) NorthSideBenjiToronto, CanadaNorthSideBenji: “My biggest inspirations are my brother and my life. Everything around me and everything I go through. That’s what inspires me to make music. Just the idea of making a better life for ourselves and the ones who come after us is important to me. I want to create generational wealth. As far as my identity, I am my work. My work is me. What you see is what you get. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund couldn't come at a better time. It’s definitely going to help boost my album and help get my videos shot the way they should be.” NSG - Petite [Official Video] NSGLondon, England, United KingdomNSG: “We would describe our music as world music, a sort of vibe and feeling that can’t be located or reconstructed anywhere else. Our passion for music started from school and always recording ourselves, which grew into a hobby that we knew we were destined for greatness. The funding and opportunity with YouTube helps spread the message of NSG to a wider audience allowing us to infect more people with the vibe we bring to the music scene.” Omah Lay - Understand (Official Music Video) Omah LayPort Harcourt, NigeriaOmah Lay: “My background influences my music in a whole lot of ways. I am Nigerian born and raised in Port Harcourt. The strong culture we have back home, and the environment as well, play a big role in how I make my music. My music speaks to the people that love me, the people I love, and the people who have been through what I have been through. I see the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund impacting my career in different ways. It will ease the financial burden of production for my music and some lifestyle-related content that I am embarking on, as well as in marketing them to a greater audience.” DOLORES DALA GUARDIÃO DO ALÍVIO - O FILME Rico DalasamSão Paulo, BrazilRico Dalasam: “My music brings together current sounds and references from across the African diaspora. This is the setting where I place confessional poems from a Brazilian songbook of the present. I am a crossroads of all the layers that life has brought me, and today I translate this into music. I don't like to be doomed to anything! My biggest reference is the simple and magical people that life gives us, children, old, and enchanted. The collaboration with YouTube can help in the making and propagation of my final product. That's a good thing. Dreams often don't come true because resources are lacking even if there is plenty of talent. Good luck to us.” Savannah Ré - Where You Are Savannah RéToronto, CanadaSavannah Ré: “I would describe my music as a deep dive experience. I say exactly what I’m feeling in an unfiltered way. While it can be very upfront, it also feels like the hug you didn’t know you needed. My work is a part of my identity. The way I write, move, and perform all comes from my roots and background. I’m blessed to be Canadian. I wouldn’t change it for even a second. I do, however, believe the support of Black musicians here still has a ways to go. This Fund will be able to create access to a lot of resources I wouldn’t otherwise be able to have.” Can't Dance To A Track That Ain't Got No Soul/Midas Touch (Official Music Video) Slick RickBronx, New York, United StatesSlick Rick: \"My music and art is a collective of imagination, grit, and storytelling with no apologies. From Dionne Warwick, The Beatles, Grandmaster Caz to Missy Elliott… these are my musical heroes. Ambiance, environment, and fashion spark my creativity. It's an honor to partner with YouTube via the BCF Initiative to utilize my pulpit, platform, and presence to share what endurance, the power of imagination, and pure authenticity looks like in the creative artists space.” Tai Verdes - A-O-K (Official Video) Tai VerdesPalos Verdes, Los Angeles, CATai Verdes: “My music is my thoughts. I try to keep things super authentic and never sing about things that don’t feel real to me. Being vulnerable is just something that you can’t really compare to anything else. It’s like a superpower. My identity is just a combination of my past experiences and situations. I make the music for myself. I don’t really make it for anyone else. The best part of the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund is that it lets me be even more creative. I can try things, make mistakes, and get better, which is the whole point of being an artist. This whole project is adding fuel to the fire, and I’m proud to be a part of it.” Tamera - Strong For Me (Official Video) TameraKent, England, United KingdomTamera: “My love for creating beautiful things from a young age pushed me to become an artist, whether that be painting, writing, singing, or dancing. It made me feel alive so I knew I wanted to be some form of an artist very early on in my life. My music is always going to be an experience, an insight to who I am and what I’m going through. It currently lives in the R&B world but transcends through other genres like Afroswing, reggaeton, and hip hop. I think the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund is an incredible opportunity for young Black artists to really be heard and seen! I’m gearing up to drop my first project so this grant will help massively with bringing my ideas to life. I’m honored to be part of it.” Tasha & Tracie - SUV feat. Yunk Vino (Prod. Mu540) Tasha & TracieSão Paulo, BrazilTasha & Tracie: We've always loved music. Our parents breathed music, so I think that influenced a lot, but our dad's Igbo culture was really inspiring because musical experiences were magical for us both at church and at parties. We get a lot of inspiration from our own life, and affective memories where we want to go also inspires a lot in our music. I would describe our sound as Gemini, and it's also very outskirts of São Paulo! Geminiano because it has many different influences just like us. It's a really crazy mix. We grew up going in pagodas on the street and in flux, and listening to all kinds of rap. There's also a lot of forró in any periphery, and the whole atmosphere that we grew up in inspires us. In short, our sound is Gemini, peripheral from São Paulo, and is made up of emotional memory.” Teezo Touchdown - Mid (Official Video) Teezo TouchdownBeaumont, Texas, United StatesTeezo Touchdown: “One night me and my family went to the movies to go see Harry Potter & The Chamber Of Secrets, but it was sold out and Drumline was the only movie available. So I went to see Drumline, and it influenced me to be in band, which led to my appreciation for songwriting and showmanship. What influences my music is to one day have my art inspire someone like Drumline did to me. In Drumline, Nick Cannon received a full ride scholarship to Atlanta A&T from his music ability. I look at this grant from YouTube as my full ride that I plan to invest into this career that will inspire generations to come.“ whiterosemoxie - 0006TeslaSpaceForce [Official Video] whiterosemoxieDetroit, Michigan, United Stateswhiterosemoxie: ““My music sounds like if you could hear the feeling of butterflies in your stomach. My identity and my work ethic are very multifaceted. I am constantly inspired by my surroundings and my adversity. Artists who push the boundaries of their craft also inspire me and my music.

My father is a reggae DJ and radio broadcaster, and so he would always be playing new tracks and dubplates he was excited about. I think that energy was contagious. My brother was the first to show me about making beats when he brought home a copy of FL Studio. I was learning violin and piano at the time at school, and I really enjoyed being able to apply my skills into making beats. I was also drawn to watching YouTube videos of Pharrell working in the studio and started to realize I wanted to learn and understand that process more. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will really help me to execute my vision for promoting the British-Jamaican connection. I have been working on a writing camp concept that takes place in Jamaica which is centered around connecting young Black talent both from within Jamaica and internationally.”Credits: \"Up Inna” - Cadenza feat. MIA & GuiltyBeatz Compass CompassNorth London, England, United KingdomCompass: “I wanted to be a psychiatrist at the time I entered the music industry. People always opened up to me, and I was always a good listener and hyper empathetic. If you look over my discography, a lot of the records I’ve created with artists are close to their hearts, speaking on subjects that they would never usually have told anybody. I like to write with substance, lyrics being first-string and then base the production around the song. It would be great if the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund could shed even more light on the music and all other work I create. Not many people know who’s responsible for a lot of the work they love, so hopefully it encourages people to get to know more about the BTS of records etc., whether I’m involved in them or not.”Credits: ”Hypocrite” - Compass Dallas Woods Dallas WoodsWyndham, West Australia, AustraliaDallas Woods: “I'm a proud Menang Noongar man. I grew up in Wyndham in Western Australia’s East Kimberley. For the last three years, I have been writing, collaborating, making, and releasing music and content. My music is a reflection of my personality and truths, mixed with freedom of speech and movement, with some conscious, cheeky bars with high-end production and beats. My music is me talking about some hard-hitting truths behind some hard-hitting beats wrapped up with a whole lotta love and energy. I see the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund impacting my career by enabling me to connect, explore, create, and collaborate. It will enable me to create music and content, expand my audience, and build followers and fans that will hear my story and see my artistic vision. Using the platform will enable me to create my own community within my channel and be able to build that audience. It will allow me to show people some behind the scenes and get an insight into my creative process. I will be creating music to push change in the right direction for POC and for all the tribes and clans ​​— for Australia.”Credits: “If It Glitters It's Gold” - Dallas Woods Dj Lag Dj LagJohannesburg, South AfricaDj Lag: “All that I am is influenced by my need to express myself through music, and my ambition to create a language to communicate my identity. Those who know me intimately will tell you that my music is very much an extension of my personality. Growing up, I looked up to Msawawa, a famous South African kwaito singer, because he stayed in the same area as me. I grew up wanting to be a superstar like Msawawa in his prime. These days, my experiences inspire me and my music - like the different city sounds I hear when I’m traveling, or the sound of township hustle when I’m back home. Gqom is my sound. It is a genre that we created so it is hard to compare it to something that didn't exist before. Gqom is a fusion of different genres but with a taste of South African township nightlife, like what happens after 2 a.m. on the streets. It’s a living genre that we’re always evolving.”Credits: “Siyagroova” - DJ Lag & DJ Tira Gloria Kaba Gloria KabaIrvington, New Jersey, United StatesGloria Kaba: “My music is influenced by 60s soul and R&B, 70s Motown, 80s pop, and 90s hip-hop and R&B. You will find classic pop songwriting with familiar yet edgy musical backdrops. I didn’t come from a musical family but always had an affinity for music. I can’t explain why, but I’ve always been drawn to it and it’s always spoken to me in a way nothing else has. My production influences in my formative years were the Neptunes and Kanye West. My favorite songwriters were Smokey Robinson and Babyface. I believe the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will help me connect with an audience I can inspire with my story and provide a platform for up and coming creatives. I’m excited about the opportunity to form a team, to consistently put out content, and to engage and build a community of like-minded creatives.”Credits: “Borderline (An Ode To Self Care)” - Solange HARV HARVKansas City, Missouri, United StatesHARV: “Growing up in a musical family, I was inspired by music at an early age. My originality and unique approach to creating music influences my sound and lyrics. I always like to incorporate live guitars, bass, or piano instrumentals. I also like to add some modernizing sounds. It just depends on what I’m working on. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund is impactful because it advocates for diversity and more representation, and I think it’s amazing to see that they’re committed to giving Black artists and performers a larger platform to be heard!”Credits: \"Peaches\" - Justin Bieber IAmTash IAmTashBoston, Massachusetts, United StatesIAmTash: “I would describe my beats as innovative, melodic, culture-influencing, and a mix of the older R&B bounce mixed with the newer hip-hop bounce. Dipset really influenced me to become a producer. Hearing the way they rapped over the sample beats just made me want to get into the creation process of it. French Montana “Sanctuary” was the song that really pushed me to make my first beat. I see the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund impacting my career by helping in promoting my brand and also giving me jewels and info on the music industry that I lack. And that I am grateful for.”Credits: \"What You Know Bout Love\" - Pop Smoke Jay Versace Jay VersacePleasantville, New Jersey, United StatesJay Versace: “ I wouldn’t describe the music that I create. It’s something that you just have to use your own perspective and relate in your own way. Some things you can’t really just describe to people. Some things they have to perceive. Because I make art, my identity is my work. The things I create are a reflection of me. So I really don’t separate my work from who I am. Everything that I create came from me. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will put me in an environment to create on a broader spectrum, which will give me the chance to express myself in ways where I never even imagined with people that I never thought could be possible. I’m really excited to work with the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund.”Credits: \"Safari\" - Tyler, The Creator jetsonmade jetsonmadeColumbia, South Carolina, United Statesjetsonmade: “My music identity is a reflection of me and how I am feeling. It just really depends on my vibe at the time and how I am feeling that day in the studio. My influence on my decision in becoming a producer grew due to growing up in church and with the support of my mom. I want to influence Carolina with my sound. The funding from #YouTubeBlack Voices will help me help the upcoming producers that look up to me and help me gain the proper tools to help them further their careers.”Credits: “WHATS POPPIN” - Jack Harlow Kobie Dee Kobie DeeSouth Sydney, Bidjigal Land, AustraliaKobie Dee: “I would describe my music as reality rap. A lot of my music that I make is about my surroundings and my environment growing up. It’s me telling my story and the story of my community. My identity and my lived experience informs all my work. I write music that shares insight to things I’ve gone through, battled with, and have overcome.

What inspires our sound and lyrics is definitely the people of Africa. Their nature is enough to make anyone love what they do. We do not believe you will find happier people on earth. They inspire us to put an African sound on the map so the world can watch in awe how we live and embrace each other in spite of our challenges. As artists, we were the hardest hit by the pandemic. The funding will help us ensure we continue the trajectory to take Amapiano to the world. We will continue to travel and immerse this beautiful sound to anyone and everyone that crosses our path and continue to scale it through our Balcony Mix experiences on YouTube. *It’s Piano to the world*”Credits: “Dinaledi” Major League DJz, Abidoza feat.

I've been attached to an 808 and explicit lyrics since I was a child. My mother, even though I didn't want to, influenced me to become a musician/producer. My sound is inspired by rebellion, daring, and wit. I would call it Quebrada World Music // Worldwide Hood Music. I believe the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will provide a spotlight of exponential reach. I only need to be seen, my sound guarantees me.”Credits: \"Nois É\" - Mu540, Fleezus & MC Bin Laden Nova Wav Nova WavTallahassee, Florida / Atlanta, Georgia, United StatesNova Wav: “We are known for making music that's usually based in hip-hop and R&B, but we strive to do “NOVA” in all genres. A NOVA is a binary star system in outer space that revolves around each other until they merge to create a beautiful explosion. We often say that the music we make, no matter the genre, is universal. We also try to make the lyrical messages as positive as possible because we feel those are the farthest-reaching, longest-lasting records, and the most touching records. Music is Magical. If we can give a glimmer of hope, a spec of power, a seed to grow in our music, it can touch someone, and that someone can change the world. We really appreciate the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund shining a light on us and our music. We plan to keep trying to make music we believe in and use this platform to support other young Black artists and producers, and help them make their voices heard.”Credits: \"Black Parade\" - Beyonce OG Parker OG ParkerAtlanta, Georgia, United StatesOG Parker: “As a young, successful, African-American creative, my identity is my work. I am proud of my culture and heritage, and it has been a critical part of my work. Hearing my brother playing music growing up inspired me to really dive into composing, and the fact that my grandfather was a renowned pianist who also taught music at the prestigious Morehouse College sealed the deal. You can kind of say I was born into music. My sound is inspired by personal life and experiences. I would describe it as traditional R&B inspired with hard drums. I always approach music with the goal of touching my audience. I want them to walk away feeling something every time they hear my music. The #YouTubeBlack Voices campaign gives creatives like me the opportunity to inform and provide a positive platform to help Black creatives insert themselves on more mainstream levels.”Credits: \"Thot Shit\" - Megan Thee Stallion P.Priime P.PriimeLagos, NigeriaP.Priime: “I'm from a musically inclined family, and I have fallen in love with music since I was a little boy. I was in the church choir. I played the piano and drums, and the whole process of bending musical sheets to my taste fascinated me to become a composer. I am really detailed and all about breaking boundaries generally and that tells in my music. I have made different types of songs for different artists, hence a combination of ideas and emotions. I would say as long as you can relate to my sound, then that's it. I have so many ideas I'd love to bring to life, and I know with the right resources and funding, l'll be able to achieve that.”Credits: \"Anoti\" - WizKid RDD RDDPaulo Afonso, Bahia, BrazilRDD: “In the beginning, I just wanted to make music, and only after I came to see myself as a producer. Some producers like Kanye West, Pharrell, P2J, and Jae5 inspire me a lot. My music is music made to be free, to move, to transcend. In it I bring my roots from Bahia/Brazil and mix with world pop references. I think the way I bring contemporary elements to percussive roots music from Bahia makes my DNA. People can identify me very easily in my production. My signature is different! I see this opportunity as a door that I'm unlocking to connect me more and more with the world.”Credits: \"We Go Hard\" - RDD, Agent Sasco & Dfideliz Rodriguinho RodriguinhoBauru, São Paulo, BrazilRodriguinho: “I became a musician under the influence of my family: everyone played at home and sang. Becoming a composer was a necessity. I started to see that I didn't see myself in the songs they sent me. I didn't see my stories, I didn't see my words, so it was a necessity to start composing. I like Black music a lot, so my sound was always thinking about Black music, hip hop and such. And the lyrics have to be as real as possible. That way, I can even write the story, but we have to be able to see it by listening. I don't really like to fantasize in lyrics. I write for those who identify with the music. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will impact not only mine, but the careers of many Black talents. I think there are a lot of people to be revealed, a lot of people motivated to show their work. It's going to be pretty amazing.”Credits: \"O Show (Ao Vivo)\" - Legado Telz TelzLagos, NigeriaTelz: “I'll describe my music as if it were a human. It has character and it speaks for itself. I've had influences from Travis Barker, Timbaland, and Sarz. Little things like road trips, church choir, and spoken words influence my sound. My identity is entirely different from what I do, and that's a good thing. It's unexpected. I see the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund impacting my career in various ways, most especially making my ideas become real. Also it'll help me network with other creatives globally.”Credits: \"Abule\" - Patoranking Walshy Fire Walshy FireMiami, Florida, United StatesWalshy Fire: “I'm influenced by many, but if I had to narrow it down, I'd say Burning Spear, Celia Cruz, Lord Kitchener, Rakim, Barry White, and Sade influenced my decision to produce music. Life's experiences and traveling the world has inspired my sound. I would call that sound a sophisticated fusion of Caribbean and American music — Trinidadian soca, Jamaican reggae, American hip-hop, and dance music — to dance floors across the world. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund will amplify my effort to introduce sounds and artists from different corners of the world. I hope to make the world a bit smaller through music.”Credits: \"Call Me\" - Walshy Fire, Mr Eazi & Kranium WondaGurl WondaGurlToronto, CanadaWondagurlCredits: ”Antidote” - Travis Scott YAOB YAOBMelbourne, Victoria, AustraliaYAOB: “Growing up in a mixed cultural family, I was exposed to a wide variety of musical influences. I would listen to soul and African music that my mother would play, and funk and Arabic music that my dad would listen to. The one thing that my ear was always drawn to was the bass lines in songs, no matter the genre. This variety has influenced my music to be rhythmic and diverse. I love to bring energy and smiles and happiness to people. You never know how someone is actually feeling, so to be light and happy could really make someone's day, which I think is reflected in my music. At the end of the day, to me, that’s what life is about. Lifting others up and lending your time and energy to build a community. Honestly, this opportunity couldn’t have come at a better time given the circumstances we are under at the moment. It will help fund the project and give me more time to focus on the goals I really want to achieve. Not just for myself, but for the people around me that I would love to collaborate with to create something amazing, and to build connections that will last a very long time.”Credits: \"A.O.K\" - Adrian Eagle Check out music from these songwriters and producers on the Class of 2022 playlist here."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/one-year-of-youtube-shorts-what-weve-learned-so-far","date":"2021-10-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","Shorts","News & Events"],"title":"One year of YouTube Shorts — what we’ve learned so far","text":"One year ago, we introduced an early beta of YouTube Shorts in India to further our mission to give everyone a voice and help creators grow their audiences with short-form video.

That's what we're seeing now with animated Minecraft videos - a topic that's historically been popular on YouTube, but creators are now experimenting with Shorts, too. Using more detailed renderings, fun narratives, and popular trends, creators are expanding upon the familiar tools and experiences of the game and producing inventive Shorts for their audience. Music grows and BTS inspires Music is coming to life on Shorts all over the world. Artists are creating one-of-a-kind music moments to connect with their fans and vice versa, fans are sharing glimpses into their own lives soundtracked by their favorite songs - all on Shorts.Most recently, we partnered with global pop icons BTS for this summer's “Permission to Dance Challenge.” BTS encouraged people around the world to recreate the \"International Sign\" dance moves for \"Joy,\" \"Dance,\" and \"Peace\" from their “Permission to Dance” music video, all with their own style. You can read more about the impact of the challenge here! 💜We have millions of songs in our music library and are so happy to see that artists and fans everywhere are using them to create new trends and stay connected with one another. We are breaking new ground with the music industry and will be partnering with even more artists to create special music moments only on Shorts - stay tuned for more to come this year! Early learnings as we build YouTube Shorts from the ground upAs we continue to build YouTube Shorts, we’re focused on three key areas: building a creation experience that empowers anyone to create and find an audience; refining our viewer experience to make sure we’re helping people find Shorts that they’ll love and discover new creators; and determining more ways we can reward creators for the Shorts they make that delight the YouTube community. Here’s an update on what we’ve learned so far in each area:"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/teachers-day-in-brazil-how-youtube-shorts-can-make-learning-fun","date":"2021-10-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Learning & Education","News & Events"],"title":"Teachers’ Day in Brazil: How YouTube Shorts can make learning fun","text":"Today marks Teachers’ Day in Brazil, which celebrates the work, commitment, and contributions of educators to the development of the nation. To honor the day, we’re looking at how Brazilian learning creators are helping students of various ages explore different subject areas through YouTube Shorts. Educational content on YouTube recently became even more important for students and teachers, mainly due to formerly in-person lessons moving online during the pandemic. In 2020, according to the recently released YouTube Impact Report prepared in collaboration with Oxford Economics, 100% of students over the age of 18 who use YouTube report using the platform to aid them with their homework or studies. And 92% of Brazilian teachers say that they use YouTube content in their lessons.Video lessons, exercise-solving videos, and live streaming to prepare for tests are among existing formats available to students who need extra help to absorb material and perform well in school or college. Now, with YouTube Shorts, students can use small breaks throughout the day to broaden their knowledge in a fun way with their cell phones. For those doing the teaching, it's also easier to create super dynamic videos anywhere using just their mobile device. Ever wonder why T. Rex's arms run on the short side? Tempting TriviaShorts is ideal for sharing trivia on virtually anything, serving as a starting point to pique an audience's interest on a subject and a bridge to more detailed videos. In less than 40 seconds, the MinuteEarth channel manages to entertain while explaining the potential hypotheses behind Tyrannosaurus Rex's short arms. Professor Rafael Irigoyen, from the Pura Física (Pure Physics) channel, capitalized on recent special events to share, in 24 seconds, interesting information on rocket launches. Tourism expert Marê uses Shorts to share interesting trivia and historical facts about iconic places around the world, such as why the Leaning Tower of Pisa doesn't stand up straight. Finding humour/humor in British and American English How do you spell that? How do you pronounce It?Learning how to correctly use the Portuguese language can be easy, fun and effective with short videos that answer the most common questions. Such popular inquiries include when to use \"porque\" and \"por que\", the difference between “há” and “a”, how to use the past participle correctly, and how to spell certain words we find confusing. For those starting to learn a new language, questions can also arise around pronunciation: in this fun example, teacher Carina Fragozo explores the differences between spoken British and American English. Another interesting use for shorts is to learn new vocabulary, such as in this video from TeacherIHaveaQuestion, which explains phrasal verbs through two practical examples. Take five: Dividing by 5 Tips and TricksMath and science can also be made simpler using YouTube Shorts. In this video, which already has more than 3.8 million views, teacher Sandro Curió shares an interesting tip that makes it easy to divide any number by five. If you're struggling with geometry, there are quick demonstrations of exercises that can help you learn how to calculate areas and perimeters. And for chemistry and physics, there are quick tricks for remembering the main formulas that come up in tests and entrance exams, such as measuring heat or how to find the typical concentration of a chemical solution. These are just a few ways of how YouTube Shorts can help you discover new things about the world around you during quick breaks. And with more content being added to the Shorts shelf every day, there’s no limit to what you can learn in less than a minute."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/doctors-bring-their-expertise-vaccines-youtube","date":"2021-10-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Health","News & Events"],"title":"Doctors bring their expertise on vaccines to YouTube","text":"For more than a century vaccines have been an important tool for public health, helping to prevent the spread of serious illness and saving millions of lives each year. In fact, just last week the WHO approved the world’s first vaccine to prevent malaria, which kills more than 250,000 children under the age of five each year in Africa. And every year, parents around the world protect their kids against illnesses like polio, measles and diphtheria with safe and effective vaccines. As with any healthcare decision, parents have questions about when, where, and how to get vaccines for their children as their kids come of age to get their first shot. Likewise, vaccines are important for adults to prevent diseases like flu, pneumonia, and shingles. Vaccines not only reduce the chance of infection, but also help prevent hospitalization, disability, exacerbation of chronic diseases, and death. Physicians are trusted messengers and play a critical role in educating their patients about which vaccines are recommended based on their age and risk factors.That’s why we’re excited today to announce new partnerships with the American Academy of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and the American College of Physicians on three video series to help answer top questions about vaccines, share the latest science, and make information from some of the world’s top vaccine experts available to everyone through YouTube.The American Academy of Pediatrics’ ten-part series will answer some of the most common questions that parents ask pediatricians about their children’s immunizations, including why vaccines are recommended at certain ages, what side effects to anticipate, and how to reduce the pain of shots. The AAP has recently conducted research in partnership with the FrameWorks Institute into how to improve public understanding and acceptance of vaccines, and used this research to inform its approach to the video series. The series will feature straightforward, friendly advice from practicing pediatricians who talk with parents every day about their children’s immunizations. With these videos, AAP will bring the same kind of advice parents seek from their trusted pediatrician to YouTube, making it accessible to a broad audience of caregivers seeking accurate information about their children’s health. The renowned Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has already produced an extensive library of educational content about pediatric vaccines. Through this new partnership with YouTube, it will produce a series of videos featuring Dr. Paul Offit, Director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, in some cases alongside influential pediatricians to disseminate science-based information and address misinformation. Dr. Offit is an internationally recognized expert in the fields of virology and immunology, and a leader in the global movement to reduce vaccine hesitancy. We are also partnering with the American College of Physicians (ACP) on a multi-part series for both physicians and patients that will address misinformation around vaccines and provide evidence-based, scientific information about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. ACP is a leader in providing vaccine education for adults and this content will build on ACP's ongoing vaccine education efforts. The videos will focus on supporting physicians and other healthcare professionals with effective communication strategies to build vaccine confidence and address concerns that are rooted in misinformation. ACP's videos will also educate the public about where to get trusted, credible information, and provide viewers with an opportunity to ask physicians vaccine questions as part of their Ask Your Internist Q&A series. These new partnerships build upon the library of authoritative and helpful resources for families and physicians around the world on YouTube, including Saúde da Infância, the channel from Pediatrics Hospital Sabará, Pensi Institute and Autism and Reality in Brazil, which launched a six-episode series focused on the importance of pediatric vaccination. In the videos, parents can learn more about why they should vaccinate their children, how to talk about that with kids, the vaccination calendar and other important and informative topics covered by health experts. In addition, they have produced animation videos explaining COVID and vaccines to parents and their kids. The NHS in England creates patient information videos to ensure that safe informative content is available to support people making vaccine decisions, which are shared on their channel. This includes parent information videos about vaccine safety in children, campaigns about annual flu vaccines, and COVID-19 specific videos such as vaccine development and safety, and helping to explain the COVID-19 vaccine to children.All of this helpful content complements our efforts to raise up authoritative health sources about vaccines on our platform and remove vaccine misinformation. We recently announced an expansion of our medical misinformation policies to cover all currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and the WHO. We also announced in July that we have introduced new ways to help users more easily find and identify content from authoritative sources when seeking information on health topics and questions.These new partnerships and features are just the latest step in our work to make science-based information about vaccines more accessible to users around the world, and we look forward to continuing to expand to more regions and more partners in the coming months."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/meet-rights-defenders-fighting-girls-everywhere","date":"2021-10-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Health","News & Events"],"title":"Meet the Rights Defenders Fighting For Girls Everywhere","text":"YouTube is celebrating International Day of the Girl by honoring the young women and girls who strive for, dream about, and work towards a more just world for girls everywhere. And, on this International Day of the Girl, we also pause to recognize the girls’ rights defenders in Afghanistan–those we have lost and those still fighting for their rights and freedoms. Today, with some remarkable girl rights defenders and medical experts, we are launching Body of Knowledge—a content series to provide clear, authoritative information to young women and girls about their health and well-being in partnership with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), girls’ rights activists, Young Women’s Freedom Center, and Vital Voices Global Partnership. Girls’ rights defenders understand that young women and girls need accurate information about their bodies to exercise full agency over their bodies–because knowledge is power, always. We’ll feature their conversations with adolescent health specialists from the AAP who offer straightforward, medically accurate information, and with Creator and Activist Hailey Sani. Together, these diverse voices will discuss the crucial health issues of safety, consent, mental health and self-care, and sexual well-being on YouTube and through YouTube Shorts.Each of them is remaking a world where all young women and girls–cis, trans, and gender-expansive–are healthy, safe, and free. We are honored that they, as well as girls’ rights defenders in different parts of the globe, are part of the Body of Knowledge.We hope you’ll tune in and join the conversation at #BodyofKnowledge.Get to know a few of the girls’ rights defenders below who are making it their mission to advocate and raise up girls everywhere! You can also support the efforts of Vital Voices Global Partnership’s Emergency Fund for Afghan Women and Young Women’s Freedom Center to help empower girls around the world. AarnaWhy are you an activist for young women and girls' rights and well-being?As a young woman of color myself I have experienced first hand and had to be conscious of the various barriers and threats that women face. I am passionate about women's rights because I want to ensure that future generations of women don't have to live in fear or shame. I believe it is important that we empower and celebrate all women. What's the biggest threat to girls' rights today?The biggest threat to women's rights is the constant policing and violation of our bodies. From abortion bans to sexual violence to sexual objectification in media, young women's bodies are exploited by the male gaze, making us feel as though our bodies are not our own but the property of others. What can people do to get involved to help support girls' rights and well-being everywhere?To support women's rights, one can always support organizations like RAINN and National Organization of Women. But the most important thing allies can do is uplift and empower the women in their own lives. It's important to start conversations surrounding consent, bodily autonomy and reproductive justice. Make sure that you are treating the women in your life with respect and dignity and ensuring that others around you are doing the same. BrittanyWhy are you an activist for young women and girls' rights and well-being?I have a deep-seated commitment to creating a world where all girls can live in peace and freedom from all forms of violence, access all that’s necessary to lead healthy lives, live in dignity, feel celebrated and fulfill all of their dreams. I have worked tirelessly for over a decade with organizations like Girls for Gender Equity, Sadie Nash Leadership Project, Vera Institute for Justice, and Advocates for Youth, to ensure that vision becomes fully realized. What's the biggest threat to girls' rights today?Unfortunately, there are many threats to girls’ rights both domestically in the US and abroad. I’m particularly concerned with the ongoing threats to achieving reproductive justice and reproductive equity for cis and trans girls and non-binary youth, especially those of color. Young people deserve a world that offers them unfettered access to the power, resources, and support to make informed decisions about their bodies, identities, and sexual and reproductive health.What can people do to get involved to help support girls' rights and well-being everywhere?There are many ways folks can take action to support girls’ rights especially as they concern their rights to safety, autonomy, health and reproductive justice. I recommend that folks read and learn about the work to decriminalize school environments for girls, primarily Black girls and youth of color. Other actions include advocating on the local, state and national level for K-12 comprehensive education, and organizing to codify Title IX on the local levels in every state. Finally it is important to redistribute funds and donate to organizations working alongside girls to center their leadership, reshape power structures, and amplify the demands of all young people. CandelaWhy are you an activist for young women and girls' rights and well-being?I am an activist for young women and girls because I live in a culture obsessed with the female body and everyday I see gender inequalities in education, work, and the well-being of girls and women.What inspires me is the hope that the new generation grows up free of social mandates and can take care of their mental, physical and emotional health, to prevent body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem and eating disorders.What's the biggest threat to girls' rights today?The biggest threat to girls’ rights is seeing ourselves as an object, an ornament. Emphasis is placed on our physical appearance and we are valued more for our body than for our potential. This objectification generates symbolic and physical violence, low self-esteem and body dissatisfaction, harms personal well-being, and generates inhibitions in daily life, job performance and interpersonal relationships. It's time we were valued for who we are, not how we look.What can people do to get involved to help support girls' rights and well-being everywhere?One way to get involved is by reviewing and identifying privileges, fostering critical thinking in favor of social acceptance of bodily, sexual, and gender diversity. Stop criticizing other people's bodies, and respect the choices that each person makes about their body. Question prejudices and social labels, value women for their abilities and not for how they look. Consume brands that promote diversity. And most importantly: support organizations that work day by day for gender equality. HaleemaWhy are you an activist for young women and girls' rights and well-being?I grew up seeing and being impacted by various forms of gender-based violence such as sexual harassment, state violence, and domestic violence. As a child, I did not understand why this was happening or how to stop it. My journey into young womanhood empowered me to take action, to speak up and to do something. It was because of women TGNC (Transgender and Gender Nonconforming) adults who modeled for me and mentored me that I was able to develop my own voice. I am an activist for young women and girls*, and gender-expansive youth because I can’t live knowing that half of our society is being held back, oppressed, and harmed. Fighting for the needs of girls and gender-expansive youth is fighting for fundamental human rights, rights that when granted, benefit us all. When girls thrive, we all do. What's the biggest threat to girls' rights today?The biggest threat to girls*’ rights today are toxic cultural norms that permeate all levels of our society, influencing media, government policies, and behaviors. Examples of this culture include rape culture and the gender binary which result in the enactment of violence on girls* and gender-expansive youth. At Alliance for Girls, we believe that it is imperative that our advocacy includes intentional narrative and cultural strategy to combat these harmful norms and help create new ones. What can people do to get involved to help support girls' rights and well-being everywhere?Girls and gender-expansive youth need caring adults who can support them, access to gender responsive programs, and resources that meet their expressed needs. To that end, girls organizations need to be well funded to provide this, and our government agencies are including girl leaders at the table to inform policy decisions that impact their lives. Every day, people have the power to make change. I think of leaders like Santana, a trans activist fighting for safer public transit in the Bay Area, or youth researcher Uche, as well as the the amazing individuals on Alliance for Girls’ Young Women’s Leadership Board, who have shone a bright light on the issues facing girls amid the COVID-19 pandemic. They inspire me every day with their advocacy and remind me of the power we each hold to speak up, act, and make change. *“Girls” refers to gender-expansive youth (cis girls, trans girls, non-binary youth, gender non-conforming youth, gender queer youth and any girl-identified youth). IslaWhy are you an activist for young women and girls' rights and well-being?I was born in a small town in the countryside of Brazil. There we were defined by social roles that reserved for girls a place of ascension solely related to motherhood and domestic tasks, which facilitated school dropouts, pregnancy and early marriage. My parents, on the other hand, have always encouraged me to pursue my full potential through education. I now recognize that this is what saved me to be just myself.So I fight every day for more girls to have the opportunity to fulfil their dreams and goals, no matter what the society imposes.What's the biggest threat to girls' rights today?The biggest threat to girls' rights today is the patriarchal ideology that limits our self-knowledge, our belief in our potential, and our ability to genuinely connect with other women with sorority. Because we grew up in a society structured from a male bias, we often learn to normalize situations of violence or restriction of our rights. And that is precisely why we need to work on a female network to reframe different beliefs and build a society that fully respects us.What can people do to get involved to help support girls' rights and well-being everywhere?To support girls everywhere, it is necessary to responsibly seek and disseminate knowledge, particularly about gender-based violence, financial emancipation and the autonomy of female bodies. Also whenever possible, we need to be promoting spaces of conscious dialogue—whether between only women or also with men. Additionally, it is important to support organizations that promote women's and human rights in general, such as 'O Berço,' adopting a position that questions social structures and promotes equity through gender, race and class biases. SageWhy are you an activist for young women and girls' rights and well-being?I utilize my voice to effect change and push forward the fight for liberation of all girls for three simple reasons: privilege, necessity, and fear. I have the privilege of having a support system, a family, and being equipped with the knowledge needed in order to use my voice for good. The fear of existing in an uneducated society where ignorance often equals violence drives my necessity to transform the society and therefore the reality in which I exist. Ultimately, it is my fear of remaining a victim to this violence coupled with my necessity to change the world and my privilege to do so that has made me into the changemaker I am today. What's the biggest threat to girls' rights today?Autonomy. There is a war waged on our bodies and identities as women and girls. This war has claimed many lives. Decisions are being made for us and without us, starting the harmful precedent that bodily autonomy is not a right. Girls across the world are being criminalized and harmed at the hands of not only world leaders and politicians but by every citizen that allows ourt bodies to be politicized and colonized.What can people do to get involved to help support girls' rights and well-being everywhere?You can and you must stand up and fight against these injustices by educating your community both online and in the streets. Shifts in culture begin with shifts in media and legislation. We cannot sit idly by and wait for change to happen, we must be actively changing our communities, classrooms, and workplaces. We need to sign petitions, call our representatives, and actively boycott and divest from corporate leaders and public figures that actively support these systems of oppression. Terriana Why are you an activist for young women and girls' rights and well-being?I decided to be an activist for young women and girls because we need people who know what it is like being a young woman and having to navigate the world. I wanted to show youth that even though you might have had a tough childhood, you can always create a brighter, self-determined future for yourself when you stand up and advocate for yourself and others.What's the biggest threat to girls' rights today?I believe the biggest threat to girls' rights today is criminalization. Being caught in the system because of poverty and racial bias. Criminalization means that you can end up in juvenile hall for trying to survive, for being poor, for being Black, for having mental illness, and even for experiencing trauma. It means that even in school, there is a pipeline to the juvenile legal system. If you make a mistake, teachers call the police. In foster care, parents and providers call the police. You’re not seen as a full person with the right to choose for yourself—to practice self-determination. Another threat to girls' rights is the lack of resources and safe housing. Young women need housing and safe spaces, and resources so they can take care of their needs and be able to show up confidently in the world because their basic needs are being met.What can people do to get involved to help support girls' rights and well-being everywhere?People can help support girls' rights by demanding that systems that are meant to protect and meet the needs of girls are doing their work, instead of creating more harm. Jail is no place for children, and girls should not be punished by the system for needing to survive. We need to make sure every girl has access to food, shelter, love, support, and community. We shouldn’t be removed from our communities, or be criminalized for where we come from. We need everyone to invest in the power and leadership of young women. Give us the space and resources to choose for ourselves; to practice self-determination."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/dont-stop-the-music","date":"2021-10-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"Don’t Stop the Music","text":"From introducing personalized mixes for your everyday moods and moments to bringing you the most popular music from every part of the globe, YouTube Music looks to provide its users with the most immersive music experience imaginable.

That means you won’t lose access to any of their channels, and YouTube TV will continue to offer 85+ networks for $64.99. We appreciate NBCUniversal’s willingness to work toward an agreement, and we also appreciate your patience as we negotiated with them on your behalf. We know you love watching Sunday Night Football, spending your weeknights with Jimmy Fallon, and binge watching Law and Order SVU. That's why we've been working to renew our deal with NBCUniversal to continue carrying their content on YouTube TV. Since our agreement expires on Thursday, September 30, and we haven't yet been able to reach an equitable agreement, we wanted to give you an early heads up so you understand your choices.Our ask is that NBCU treats YouTube TV like any other TV provider. In other words, for the duration of our agreement, YouTube TV seeks the same rates that services of a similar size get from NBCU so we can continue offering YouTube TV to members at a competitive and fair price.If NBCU offers us equitable terms, we’ll renew our agreement with them.

Scientific understanding evolves as new research emerges, and firsthand, personal experience regularly plays a powerful role in online discourse. Vaccines in particular have been a source of fierce debate over the years, despite consistent guidance from health authorities about their effectiveness. Today, we're expanding our medical misinformation policies on YouTube with new guidelines on currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and the WHO. Since last year, we’ve removed over 130,000 videos for violating our COVID-19 vaccine policies. Our Community Guidelines already prohibit certain types of medical misinformation. We've long removed content that promotes harmful remedies, such as saying drinking turpentine can cure diseases. At the onset of COVID-19, we built on these policies when the pandemic hit, and worked with experts to develop 10 new policies around COVID-19 and medical misinformation. Since last year, we’ve removed over 130,000 videos for violating our COVID-19 vaccine policies.Throughout this work, we learned important lessons about how to design and enforce nuanced medical misinformation policies at scale. Working closely with health authorities, we looked to balance our commitment to an open platform with the need to remove egregious harmful content. We’ve steadily seen false claims about the coronavirus vaccines spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general, and we're now at a point where it's more important than ever to expand the work we started with COVID-19 to other vaccines. Specifically, content that falsely alleges that approved vaccines are dangerous and cause chronic health effects, claims that vaccines do not reduce transmission or contraction of disease, or contains misinformation on the substances contained in vaccines will be removed. This would include content that falsely says that approved vaccines cause autism, cancer or infertility, or that substances in vaccines can track those who receive them. Our policies not only cover specific routine immunizations like for measles or Hepatitis B, but also apply to general statements about vaccines.As with our COVID guidelines, we consulted with local and international health organizations and experts in developing these policies. For example, our new guidance on vaccine side effects maps to public vaccine resources provided by health authorities and backed by medical consensus. These policy changes will go into effect today, and as with any significant update, it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up enforcement. There are important exceptions to our new guidelines. Given the importance of public discussion and debate to the scientific process, we will continue to allow content about vaccine policies, new vaccine trials, and historical vaccine successes or failures on YouTube. Personal testimonials relating to vaccines will also be allowed, so long as the video doesn't violate other Community Guidelines, or the channel doesn't show a pattern of promoting vaccine hesitancy. All of this complements our ongoing work to raise up authoritative health information on our platform and connect people with credible, quality health content and sources.Today’s policy update is an important step to address vaccine and health misinformation on our platform, and we’ll continue to invest across the board in the policies and products that bring high quality information to our viewers and the entire YouTube community."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-the-upload-the-rise-of-the-creator-economy-the-first-podcast-from-youtube","date":"2021-09-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube News","Creators","News & Events"],"title":"Introducing “The Upload: The Rise of the Creator Economy,” the first podcast from YouTube","text":"At YouTube, we’ve enabled our creators to tell their stories through videos that cover pretty much every topic under the sun, from turning your sewing passion into a million dollar business to showcasing life on the family farm to becoming the oldest rookie in NFL history. That’s why today’s announcement is a bit of a curveball—we’re announcing YouTube’s first-ever podcast, called The Upload: The Rise of the Creator Economy.

It’s an honor to build a membership that allows people to more deeply immerse themselves in music, learning, fashion, gaming, and more, all the while supporting the creators and artists that make it possible. Music and Premium subscriptions are key pillars of YouTube's monetization, enabling unique content and communities to flourish. As we continue adding new features and benefits for our members, we're focused on creating experiences at the intersection of watching, listening, and engaging that are only possible because of YouTube’s diversity of voices.Below we're sharing a letter from Lyor Cohen, Global Head of Music, who recently celebrated this milestone with our music industry partners.You’ve heard me say it many times: YouTube’s twin engine growth across ads and subscriptions is fueling our goal to become the music industry’s number one driver of revenue. We recently announced that YouTube has paid out $4B to the music industry in the past 12 months. YouTube has surpassed 50 million Music and Premium subscribers, including trialers, and is the fastest growing music subscription service out there (MiDIA).

We’re making it easy for music fans to go deep and find their thing -- whether that’s on YouTube or the YouTube Music app. When Lil Nas X released the music video for “INDUSTRY BABY” with Jack Harlow, fans from all over the world got to watch the Premiere of the new visual all together for the first time. But the fan experience and engagement with Lil Nas X’s new release didn’t stop there. They were able to learn the lyrics, hear the artists break down the meaning, create a YouTube Short with the track, listen to the rapper’s back catalogue and learn more about the rapper’s story in his own words. No other platform facilitates this level of depth and exploration for music fans.There are nearly infinite “choose-your-own-fan-adventures” made possible by the artists and fans who come together on YouTube and YouTube Music every day to watch, create, share, comment, cover and remix music content on the platform. This limitless exploration is further enhanced by YouTube Premium.

The new 6,000 seat performance venue located at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, California, will host a variety of live entertainment events including concerts, theater performances, award shows, esports competitions, community gatherings, conferences, and more. A ribbon cutting to remember “YouTube is the world’s largest virtual venue connecting artists and fans, and we realized that YouTube Theater would have the ability to blend the physical and the digital together in new and exciting ways,” says Angela Courtin, YouTube’s marketing VP of brand, media, culture, and creative.YouTube Theater was built from the ground up in a 10-year partnership with the team at Hollywood Park, a nearly 300-acre sports and entertainment destination. Its unique features focus on interactivity, including a large-scale digital YouTube icon outside the venue and a digital wall inside. Both utilize motion-sensor technology so fans can interact with the screens, and it can be programmed with content related to events. Creative flexibility“Sporting event? We can program relevant creator content so the experience is extended beyond just what’s happening in SoFi Stadium next door,” Courtin says. “Esports competition? We can feature gaming creators on these digital screens. If you can dream it, we can do it through these cool new digital components.” Welcome to YouTube Theater YouTube Theater also includes livestreaming capabilities built into the infrastructure so performers can livestream their events to billions of YouTube viewers around the world.“Being in Southern California, we wanted to have both indoor and outdoor spaces, and, because we’re YouTube and a platform for artistic expression, having creative canvases throughout the theater was also key,” Courtin explains.While this partnership has been years in the making, helping to launch a venue alongside our partner during a pandemic made it a more challenging process for the teams to navigate.“We really had to be thoughtful, flexible, and patient,” Courtin asserts. “Safety has been key throughout. We’ve been very strict in following city COVID protocols, both during construction all the way through to the ribbon-cutting. We’ll continue to follow them to ensure the safety of anyone who comes to YouTube Theater.”Coming soonThe first event is scheduled to kick off in September, and the team is continuing to work with Hollywood Park on what YouTube programming will look like. In the future, they hope to use it to celebrate YouTube creators, extending content from the platform into the real world to help creators grow their businesses, and as a place to bring our company events to life.As for Courtin, she also wouldn’t mind one day seeing Chris Stapleton or Kacey Musgraves up on the YouTube Theater stage: “As a Texan, who ran to the coasts as quickly as I could out of school, I am clearly coming back to my country music roots.”"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/next-phase-searching-youtube","date":"2021-08-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"The next phase for searching on YouTube","text":"Editor's note by Neal Mohan, Chief Product Officer: YouTube’s enormous library of content has always set us apart as a platform. No matter what you’re looking for, there’s a good chance we have it on YouTube. But we know viewers need to easily find the videos they’re looking for, and quickly access the information they need. Our teams have invested significantly in improving that search experience over the years, and in today’s installment of our Innovation Series, we’re excited to share the latest technology to help you find what you’re looking for, from how-tos to DIYs. This complements the work we're doing to raise videos from authoritative sources when people come to YouTube looking for news and health information. Everyday people come to YouTube looking for learning content like physics tutorials, how-to draw a tiger, product reviews on the latest tech products, and more. And today we’re introducing new ways to help people more easily search and find content on YouTube. Video format not supported Making searches more visual People told us that they’d like easier ways to see what a video is about on YouTube before diving into the actual content. We heard you! That’s why we’ve started to make our search page even more visual to help people get a better glimpse of what’s inside a video. Up until now, when you browsed for a video to watch on YouTube, you’d see a thumbnail image of each video. It gave you a chance to gather a quick snapshot of the video’s content. Now, you’ll be able to make even more informed decisions about what you’re going to watch through video chapters directly in the search page. When available, these time-stamped images detail the different topics covered in videos and let you better evaluate the video you’re about to watch. You can also jump directly to the section most relevant to your specific interest. Let's say you're looking for a good sourdough recipe and want to work on your kneading technique. With these new search results, you can see all the steps in the video, from feeding the starter to pulling the bread out of the oven - and skip right to the chapter on kneading. Video format not supported Getting a chance to see a snippet of each video can also bring a lot of helpful context. On desktop, you can already scroll over a video and begin to see a snippet of the content on the search page. We’re rolling a version of this out to mobile to help you easily preview different videos and decide if it’s what you’re looking for. Making more content available to everyoneWhile YouTube has A LOT of videos, they don’t always cover every topic across every language. And we’re always looking for new ways to make information more accessible and inclusive for all users globally. We now have some exciting approaches to improve content searches across the globe on YouTube. We’re starting to show search results from other languages with automatically translated captions, titles and descriptions when relevant content in the local language isn’t available. This means that someone in Thailand can learn about quantum physics from a professor at MIT or viewers in Brazil can explore the Grand Canyon from home, with captions in their local language. We’ll start supplementing search results with English videos and plan to expand to more languages. Our hope is that all global content will become more accessible through translated captions and help creators reach a more global audience. We also recognize that not all searches may have enough high-quality or relevant video content to fully address what you’re looking for. To better surface information you need, we’ve recently started experimenting with a new feature to complement search results with website links and other formats from Google Search. It’s currently available on mobile devices in India and Indonesia, but we’ll consider expanding to additional countries based on user feedback. From discovering a video that deepens your understanding of a complex topic or inspires you to kick start a new hobby, we want to help you search for the right content on YouTube. We’ll continue to find ways to make that search experience even more intuitive and helpful in the future."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/how-tokyo-played-out-youtube","date":"2021-08-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube News","News & Events"],"title":"How Tokyo played out on YouTube","text":"YouTube brought all the action from Tokyo directly to you, the fan, no matter how, where, or when you planned on watching. “ During Tokyo 2020, YouTube viewers watched over 200 million hours of Olympic Games content on YouTube... 7x the amount of hours watched on YouTube during Rio 2016.” We worked with broadcasters around the world to deliver the most comprehensive viewing experience, including live streams of opening and closing ceremonies, clips of memorable moments, highlights of all the action across the 33 Olympic sports, and athlete content straight from Tokyo.

We also saw that Games content was viewed more than 190 million times per day during Tokyo, five times more than the average daily views of Olympic Games content on YouTube during Rio 2016.  From beginning to end, YouTube remained an important place for fans to find community and catch up on the incredible sporting moments.

But it's essential that as they do, they have the options and safeguards to create the experience that's right for them. Over the years, we’ve made investments to protect kids and families, such as launching a dedicated kids app, introducing new data practices for children’s content, providing more age-appropriate experiences, and giving families more choice with supervised accounts. Today, we're announcing additional protections for people under 18 on YouTube and YouTube Kids. “ Being mindful about tech use is key to everyone’s wellbeing. These new defaults for teens are protective; they increase safe, mindful tech use by making teens think about what they want to see and who they want seeing their content.” – Anne Collier executive director, The Net Safety Collaborative Updating default privacy settings for younger people In the coming weeks, we’ll gradually start adjusting the default upload setting to the most private option available for users ages 13-17 on YouTube. With private uploads, content can only be seen by the user and whomever they choose. We want to help younger users make informed decisions about their online footprint and digital privacy, including encouraging them to make an intentional choice if they’d like to make their content public. If the user would like to make their content public, they can change the default upload visibility setting and we’ll provide reminders indicating who can see their video. Making digital wellbeing features more prominentWe want to give younger users the tools they need to understand their use of technology. In addition to our suite of digital well-being tools, we’ll be turning take a break and bedtime reminders on by default for all users ages 13-17 on YouTube. We’ll also be turning autoplay off by default for these users. If a user decides these aren’t the right digital well-being features for them, they can change their default settings.  We’ll also be adding an autoplay option on YouTube Kids and turning autoplay off by default in the app. Whether you’re driving on a roadtrip with your kids or listening to nursery rhymes together while cooking dinner, we want to empower parents to be able to choose an autoplay setting that’s right for their family. In the coming months, we’ll also be launching additional parental controls in the YouTube Kids app, including the ability for a parent to choose a “locked” default autoplay setting. What’s a paid product placement? (For Kids) Providing safeguards and education about commercial contentWe’re also making changes to how we treat commercial content for kids and families. We've never allowed paid product placements in YouTube Kids, our destination for younger kids. In the coming weeks, we’ll also begin to remove overly commercial content from YouTube Kids, such as a video that only focuses on product packaging or directly encourages children to spend money.On YouTube, we recently updated the disclosures that appear on “made for kids” content or supervised accounts on YouTube when a creator identifies that their video contains paid promotions. Developed in collaboration with child development experts, the disclosures appear in easy-to-understand text and link to a kid-friendly animated video, which provides additional information on paid product placements. We’ve also provided a parent guide which suggests ways for parents to help children understand content they may see on YouTube, including paid product promotions. We’re introducing these new safety and digital wellbeing options as part of our ongoing efforts to create age-appropriate experiences for young people on YouTube and YouTube Kids. With young people watching online videos to broaden their horizons and expand their learning experiences, we're invested in being the best version of YouTube and YouTube Kids we can be.

In April, we opened applications for two new programs focused on supporting the next generation of reporters and newsrooms. We’re excited to announce today the selection of nearly 50 independent journalists and over 40 digital-first newsrooms across the programs. Our Creator Program for Independent Journalists aims to give the growing number of reporters publishing independently the tools needed to succeed on YouTube. And the Sustainability Lab for Digital-First Newsrooms provides support for digital native newsrooms to start and expand their video operations.Altogether, the participants represent 25 countries, speak nearly 20 different languages, and report on a wide range of topics, spanning local news and national politics, to undertold stories about marginalized communities.

Participants will receive grants to help fuel their new video operations. They’ll also be connected with experts at YouTube to answer questions, and join groups of their peers to share insights and experiences. The digital newsrooms selected for our Sustainability Lab will receive grants, one-on-one support from YouTube, and have rich opportunities to learn from each other as they develop video news capabilities and business plans.We also hope to learn from our first set of participants how we can further improve and iterate on these programs for future classes.

They’re storytellers, directors, editors, marketers, and entrepreneurs — all in one. To give creators the opportunities they need to find success, YouTube has evolved from being just a place where people upload and share videos. It’s now a destination where creators can find new audiences, connect with fans in different ways, and build growing businesses. In just over the last three years, we’ve paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies. We laid the groundwork for this modern-day creator economy over 14 years ago when we launched the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) — a first-of-its kind business model that shares the majority of revenue generated on the platform with creators. In just over the last three years, we’ve paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies. And in Q2 2021, we paid more to YouTube creators and partners than in any quarter in our history.Along the way, we’ve continued investing in new monetization options for creators beyond advertising, including Paid Digital Goods, merchandise, branded content and more. Our shared goal with creators is to help them build robust and diversified business models that work with both their unique content and community of fans. Today, with the launch of the Shorts Fund, creators and artists now have 10 ways to make money and build a business on YouTube. Here’s how: 1. Shorts FundThe YouTube Shorts Fund, a $100M fund distributed over 2021-2022, launches today!

Ambar Lucid - Get Lost In The Music (Official Video) Ambar Lucid Fort Collins, Colorado, United StatesAmbar Lucid: “I have always known that I wanted to be an artist. I just knew it was what to do, even if I didn’t completely understand it at times. I would describe my music as magical, healing, and inspiring. To me, being independent means having creative control and power over myself and my art. Success means being able to do things my way while having a loyal group of supporters with me throughout my journey.” Bad Milk - Ego (Official Video) Bad Milk Medellín, ColombiaBad Milk: “I think success is inspiring other people, and that’s my main goal. My music is chameleonic; I love to experiment with different sounds and portray different emotions. I don’t enjoy putting my creativity in a box. I see music as a mission. It’s definitely what I came here to do. I’m blessed to have the most caring and hard working team by my side. Working with a humongous platform like YouTube is crazy and overwhelming in the best way possible. It creates a space for artists like me to find new fans around the world.” Dangbana Republik & Bella Shmurda - Party Next Door (Official Video) Bella ShmurdaLagos, NigeriaBella Shmurda: “The music I do connects with everybody and has a message to pass. It goes beyond just music: it’s spiritual, and that’s what it’s described as ‘conscious’. Being an independent artist can mean funding your career personally, leading and working with your team to achieve all your goals. Foundry is an opportunity to elevate my career, and being a part of the program is a big win for me and for my team.” BLESSD | ⏰ HACE TIEMPO 👀( OFFICIAL VIDEO ) BlessdMedellín, ColombiaBlessd: “Being an artist is a dream I always had and also something I needed to do for my family. As an independent artist, I feel free. YouTube is my main social network to connect with my audience and it’s incredible to be a part of Foundry. I see this as a very big moment in my career.” chilldspot - Groovynight(Official Music Video) chilldspotTokyo, Japanchilldspot: “As independent artists, we can express what we really want to say and what we feel exactly. More than anything, to enjoy music is the biggest goal for us. With this support, we will be able to produce more of the video works that we are obsessed with and fans around the world will have chances to get to know us.” Doul [Howl] × Sony \"360 Reality Audio\" Special Video スペシャルビデオ DoulTokyo, JapanDoul: “I want to share my music with people all around the world, and touch their soul through my expressions such as my sound, lyrics, fashion or makeup. Thanks to Foundry, people who have never heard of me can get to know me and my music.” Ebhoni - Rep It EbhoniToronto, CanadaEbhoni: “Everything I talk about in my music is a real moment: my story, my mood, my experience. To me, independence means individuality. I feel the most success as I achieve the goals that I set for myself, from very small to very lofty. I first fell in love with music by watching people do covers on YouTube, and starting to experiment with singing and making songs my own. I see Foundry as a way to allow more people to discover my music and connect with me.” ENNY - I Want (Official Video) EnnyLondon, EnglandEnny: “Since childhood I had a love for music and the older I got, the more the desire grew. I would describe my music as a new vibe with an old feel and a fresh perspective. Being an independent artist means being a bit more hands on with all sides of your music. It might mean more work for you and your team but it makes the wins both small and big even more gratifying. For me, success is seeing people discover and connect with your music. And also knowing you've done the best you can, when creating and releasing your art.” Fana Hues - Icarus Fana HuesPasadena, California, United StatesFana Hues: “When creating a project, I sprinkle all parts of myself throughout to build a sonic journal. Integrity is crucial; My art has to stay true to me constantly. Being an independent artist provides the freedom to dream as freely as I want, and my vision comes to fruition without compromise. With the support of Foundry, I’ll be able to add more shades and hues to my canvas, giving the world more of my vision while nurturing and growing my craft.” Junior Mesa - Pushing Away (Official Music Video) Junior MesaBakersfield, California, United StatesJunior Mesa: “Being independent is a mentality. Claiming independence is saying: We are not the same! I will not conform to your standards. I will express myself in a way that satisfies my will, not yours!” I’ve basically been raised by YouTube, and it’s a huge honor to be recognized.” MARINA SENA - ME TOCA Marina SenaTaiobeiras, Minas Gerais, BrazilMarina Sena: “To be an independent artist is to have determination, free will, freedom. I love being an independent artist, making the sound that really is all about me. I don't think Foundry could come at a better time. After starting my solo career on the right foot and being about to release my first full album, there’s nothing better than support to bet on my sound and make it reach people all over the world. MEEKZ - RESPECT THE COME UP 🚁📈 Meekz Manchester, EnglandMeekz: “Everything I've put out has been sentimental to me and had a great value, deeper than just music and shooting a video. I'm telling stories in a different way, in a Meekz way. The passion always comes through. To be an independent artist takes a lot of dedication, focus, and behind the scenes work. The bigger you get in life, the challenges get bigger, and you learn to deal with them better, and overcome them. Success for me is about improvement, progression and growing with each release. It’s about building relationships and doing for people what you’d expect them to do for you. The future of independent artists to me is looking great. We make popular happen.” Paranoid 1966 - TIC TAC (prod. Boixy) Paranoid 1966Alicante, Spain Paranoid 1966: “My friends pushed me to start singing and writing songs more seriously. Now, I always try to bring new sounds that say something about myself. With my producer Boixy, I always try to innovate. I want to be able to develop my art and music without ties to any constraints. Foundry is a great opportunity to take my creativity to a new level.” Paris Texas - HEAVY METAL (Official Video) Paris Texas Los Angeles, California, United StatesParis Texas: “Being an independent artist means your ideas mold the landscape of whatever field you're in. Success as an independent artist means that whatever you've done in your field is cemented, statued, and acknowledged by artists all across the board. I would describe our music and work as a lot of good ideas and having fun.” Raveena - Petal RaveenaNew York City, New York, United StatesRaveena: “I always had an innate desire to be an artist and to express myself and be ultra-vulnerable. My music is experimental, with a backbone of pop sensibility. Visuals are also a huge part of my artistry and I love bringing people into my colorful, dream-like world. When I have a big vision, I find friends and collaborators to help me elevate my dreams along the way. I was actually really concerned about being able to create all the visions I see in my head for my upcoming album’s music videos, but I feel so supported in my endeavors, thanks to Foundry.” reggie - I DON'T WANNA FEEL NO MORE ReggieHouston, Texas, United Statesreggie: “My music tells you about me. It gives you something to relate to. I want the world to know I’m human. To me an independent artist is someone who is free to do what they want and move how they want. It’s a constant grind: you’re always talking to your team. You’re playing the game with other artists who have a lot of people behind them. But you get to make everything exactly how you want to make it. As creators, I hope we can get to a point where we can sustain ourselves. I hope the future of independent music is that it’s not even called independent music, because it’s such a normal way of doing business.” ROTE MÜTZE RAPHI x @Aylo - TAG EIN TAG AUS (OFFICIAL VIDEO) prod. Achtabahn Rote Mütze RaphiMunich, GermanyRote Mütze Raphi: “I can’t remember when I started to sing, it must have been around the time I started to think. I always said to the people around me that making music is my biggest goal. People often laugh about clear statements like this if you are young and without experience and success. But for me there wasn’t any trigger necessary to decide to become a musician. There was no alternative. Being a musician means everything to me, I can do what I really love. For me I’m successful when I can touch people with my music and maybe even help them to go through a hard time.” 새소년 (SE SO NEON) ‘자유(Jayu)’ Official MV SE SO NEONSeoul, South KoreaSE SO NEON: “We make a spectrum of colorful music that crosses the boundaries of genres, love for vintage textures, emotions and explosive energy that resonate deep in the heart, and above all, the pursuit of novelty. We’re happy to participate in Foundry, as we’re focusing not only on our activities in Korea but also on our success as a global act.” Seedhe Maut - 'Nanchaku' ft MC STΔN | Azadi Records Seedhe MautNew Delhi, Delhi, India Seedhe Maut: “Our whole lives, we’d been told this is how we had to live or do. Hip-hop helped us articulate our hopes and ambitions and be who we truly wanted to be. Once you’ve tasted that kind of freedom, that happiness and belonging, why would you ever choose to do anything else? We represent a generation that dares to dream and wants to live life on its own terms. With our music, we hope to give a voice to others like us who go against the grain and follow through on their convictions, whether that be as an artist, gamer, accountant, or whatever. As long as it’s true to you. No compromises, no regrets. Being independent grants us the freedom to evolve in any direction that we feel like. The downside of that can be that sometimes, great ideas get sidelined due to limited resources. Foundry helps remove some of those hurdles, and we’re extremely helpful to unleash our full creative potential onto the world.” Shygirl ft. Slowthai - BDE (Official Video ShygirlLondon, EnglandShygirlhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMx2-6At2Rx0kapbSjKxwJA: “My music is lusty and precious, experimental yet familiar. Being an independent artist means choosing your own narrative on a daily basis. I see Foundry as an opportunity to expand and think even bigger.” Sinead Harnett - Ready Is Always Too Late (Official Lyric Video) Sinéad HarnettLondon, EnglandSinead Harnett: “My music is honest, and influenced by classic R&B. A healing, aural hug, if you will. Being an artist is something I’ve put so much time and work into, just simply for the love of it. I never knew it would become my career, but I knew I would want to write and sing forever. I feel lucky to be independent, in the sense that I’m living up to my expectations and no one else’s. It’s not always easy, but trusting in and carving out your own vision is exhilarating. I believe success as an independent artist lies in having creative control, and in being able to sell out tours and connect to fans. Being supported by an epic team for my visuals and music will be a huge step in my career. I’m excited to reach new audiences and introduce myself to people that don’t know about me yet. Foundry is a big look, and I’m so excited to make it count.” Snail Mail - \"Heat Wave\" (Official Video) Snail MailBaltimore, Maryland, United StatesSnail Mail: “To me, being an independent artist is about the songwriting craft and maintaining integrity, while also getting to do whatever I want creatively. Snail Mail started with basement shows and tours that my bandmates and I booked ourselves, so I take a lot of pride in the work that it took to get where I am today. I define immediate success as putting out music that I would listen to myself and long term success as being able to make music for as long as it feels right to do so.” SoFaygo - Knock Knock (Directed by Cole Bennett) SoFaygoAtlanta, Georgia, United StatesSoFaygo: “Being an independent artist means going harder than anyone else. There is more to prove. You can do and be whatever you want if you just believe in yourself.” Sycco - Time's Up (Official Music Video) SyccoBrisbane, Queensland, AustraliaSycco: “Sycco music is colourful and excitable. I think my energy tends to exude those qualities. I love being my own boss, and answering to myself even when it gets hard. The satisfaction of getting something right and ticking off goals no matter how big or small is so fulfilling, and unlike any other feeling.” Tenille Arts - Back Then, Right Now (Official Video) Tenille ArtsNashville, Tennessee, United StatesTenille Arts: “My music is country, with modern lyrics and melodies. It’s vulnerable, honest, fun, and talks about real life. Being from Canada originally, I was influenced by Shania Twain to go to Nashville and start my career there, and country music always seemed like the natural decision for me. I made my first trip to Nashville after posting covers on my YouTube channel, so Foundry giving me the opportunity to have exposure I’ve always dreamed of really feels like a full circle moment. I want to share my music with a lot of people and have a lasting impact. My big goal is to have a headlining arena tour, and I don’t feel limited at all by being an independent artist. I think it’s all possible!” Nino Freestyle x Tokischa - MALA (Video Oficial) TokischaSanto Domingo, Dominican RepublicTokischa: “My music has no labels. It’s a free, new wave. I’m excited to stand out in countries that are far from my culture.” Tuyo - Sem Mentir (Videoclipe Oficial) TuyoSão Paulo, São Paulo, BrazilTuyo: “Tuyo is more about a feeling than a type of sound or genre. We mix very delicate vocals with strong rhythms. It’s music for floating, for flying. We are whole, happy and successful when we can communicate with people through music. Foundry will help us achieve our goal of starting musical conversations with people around the world, and to improve our work and make it more meaningful.”"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/bts-and-youtubes-permission-to-dance-challenge-kicks-off-today-only-on-youtube-shorts","date":"2021-07-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","Events","Artists","News & Events"],"title":"BTS and YouTube’s ‘Permission to Dance’ challenge kicks off today only on YouTube Shorts","text":"BTS Shorts Dance your 💜 out to #PermissiontoDance 💃🕺 Only on YouTube #Shorts On Monday, July 19, BTS and YouTube announced the Permission to Dance Challenge, happening only on YouTube Shorts. 21st-century pop icon, BTS, is inviting the world to dance along with them to their YouTube Global Top Songs and Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit, “Permission to Dance” on Shorts, YouTube’s recently expanded short-form video experience for anyone who wants to create short, catchy videos using nothing but their mobile phones. The challenge encourages anyone who loves to dance to make a 15-second Shorts video right from the YouTube mobile app, sharing the dance moves from the “Permission to Dance '' music video.

Some may gravitate towards tools like channel memberships while others may double down on Super Chat. At YouTube, we’re always looking for fresh ways creators can diversify their revenue streams. That’s why I’m excited to unveil our fourth Paid Digital Good — Super Thanks. This new feature gives creators yet another way to earn money while also allowing them to strengthen relationships with viewers. Video format not supported Creators are at the heart of what we do here at YouTube, and we’re constantly exploring new ways to help them get started, grow their businesses and diversify their revenue. In fact, we offer a multitude of ways that creators can make money on our platform -- from running ads and selling merchandise to channel memberships and beyond. We’ve recently been experimenting with an applause feature that allows fans to show support for their favorite YouTube channels. Based on creator feedback, today we’re super excited to share that it’s expanding to even more viewers and creators -- along with a new name: Super Thanks. Since launching Super Chat in 2017 and Super Stickers in 2019, creators from around the globe have wanted us to bring this magic beyond livestreams and Premieres to video uploads. Enter Super Thanks! Fans watching YouTube videos can now purchase Super Thanks to express their gratitude and show support. They will see an animated GIF and, as an added bonus, get a distinct, colorful comment to highlight their purchase, which creators can respond to. Super Thanks is currently available at four price points between $2 and $50 (or local currency equivalent). Just like Super Chat and Super Stickers, Super Thanks does double duty for creators: keeping their connections with (super) fans meaningful, while also giving them a new way to make money. Over the past year, we’ve partnered closely with creators to beta test this feature and gather feedback to inform and shape the experience. In fact, while beta testing Super Thanks, psychic intuitive Nicholas Ashbaugh was able to generate a new revenue stream—one that now accounts for nearly 15% of his revenue—by tapping this new way to recognize and engage with his most active fans. Here’s what he has to say:“Having a built-in feature like Super Thanks ensures that my viewers can show their love and support while watching a video -- without interrupting their viewing. It nicely augments Super Stickers and Super Chat by allowing folks who are watching a replay of a livestream to still feel like they’re being seen (thanks to the purchase animation) and also thanks to the comment that it leaves.”Super Thanks is currently in beta and with today’s expansion, is now available to thousands of monetizing creators. The feature is available to creators and viewers in 68 countries on desktop and mobile devices (Android and iOS). Creators can check if they have early access by following the instructions here. If they don’t yet have access, fear not -- we will be expanding availability to all eligible creators in the YouTube Partner Program later this year."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/bts-and-youtube-announce-permission-to-dance-challenge-only-on-youtube-shorts","date":"2021-07-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Artists","Culture & Trends","News & Events"],"title":"BTS and YouTube announce ‘Permission to Dance’ challenge only on YouTube Shorts","text":"Today, 21st century pop icons BTS and YouTube officially announce the Permission to Dance Challenge starting this Friday, July 23 through Saturday, August 14, exclusively on YouTube Shorts.

If you’re like most Americans, you head online. Whether you want to learn how to measure your blood sugar after a diabetes diagnosis, understand the different stages of breast cancer, join a community of others who are living with rare conditions or take charge of your heart health, YouTube is here to help you make informed decisions about your health journey. “ YouTube...has the potential to be a transformative tool for public health and can positively impact communities at scale.” Dr. Garth Graham At YouTube, we’re working to make it easier for people to find authoritative information to help answer their questions, and we’re putting health professionals at the core of our efforts to connect people with helpful content. I’ve spent my career trying to advance the ways that we can better reach people with the information they need to make the right health choices for themselves and their families, and I’ve had a front row seat as our approaches evolved from pamphlets handed out at doctor’s offices to online patient portals and telemedicine. In our increasingly digital world, the next phase in health communication is video, where we can connect with people and answer their questions in a way that is both visual and personal. I joined YouTube because I believe that this platform, with 2 billion monthly active users, has the potential to be a transformative tool for public health and can positively impact communities at scale. At YouTube, we’re investing to grow our platform’s role as an effective, engaging and trusted tool for public health communication through principles, partnerships and product development. Coronavirus mRNA Vaccine Safety and Efficacy Over the last year, we've continued to expand our partnerships with leading health organizations like Mass General Brigham and the American Public Health Association, as well as with clinicians and creators, to further increase the accessibility of high quality health content on our platform. These organizations are creating engaging, evidence-based videos that really connect with people, such as JAMA's crisp explanation of mRNA, Stanford Center for Health Education's Viral Facts Series, the National Alliance on Mental Illness' mental health collaboration with Vogue and many more. We’ve introduced ways to get the latest COVID-19 information and education out and reach billions of people. And now, we’re announcing two new ways that we’ll surface credible and relevant health information for people in the United States.Starting this week, you’ll see new features next to some health-related searches and videos. We’re adding new health source information panels on videos to help viewers identify videos from authoritative sources, and health content shelves that more effectively highlight videos from these sources when you search for specific health topics. These context cues are aimed at helping people more easily navigate and evaluate credible health information. People will still be able to find relevant videos from a range of sources in their search results. To identify the right sources to include in these new features, we applied the principles developed by an expert panel convened by the National Academy of Medicine, a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that brings together the top experts in health, medicine, and biomedical science to provide unbiased, evidence-based guidance about health and science. The National Academy of Medicine regularly examines complicated questions related to health, medicine, and biomedical science and over the years they have given guidance on everything from countering the opioid epidemic to gene editing. Back in February, YouTube asked an expert panel convened by the National Academy of Medicine to consider the question of how to define “authoritative health content sources” and the ways in which those sources attain and maintain their authority. The expert panel drafted these principles for health sources, which are the first of their kind. We hope that other tech companies will also review and consider how these principles might help inform their work with their own products and platforms.This is our first step towards identifying and designating authoritative health sources on YouTube. While only accredited health organizations and government entities are currently included in our health context features, we’re exploring ways to broaden eligibility and evaluate inclusion of other health sources, as well as ways to expand these features globally.  Throughout my years of working in public health and practicing medicine, I have seen the benefits of getting the right information to patients when they need it. These new features are an important step to improve our platform’s role in connecting people with high quality information. We know that there is more work to be done and our investment will continue for the long-term. ―Dr. Garth Graham, MD"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-youtube-unlisted-links","date":"2021-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"Update to YouTube Unlisted Links","text":"Unlisted is a setting for videos that can be viewed and shared by anyone with the link to that particular video, but don't show up in search results or other tabs. In 2017, we rolled out a security update to the system that generates new YouTube Unlisted links. This update included security enhancements that make the links for your Unlisted videos even harder for someone to discover (if you haven't shared the link with them). We’re now making changes to older Unlisted videos that were uploaded before that update took place. As part of these changes, Unlisted videos uploaded before 2017 will be made Private starting on July 23, 2021. We are also giving creators the option to opt out of this security update and keep their videos in their current state if they prefer. If you have a video that is impacted by this change, we’ll notify you directly. You will need to take one of the following steps before July 23, 2021: Do nothing. We’ll set any Unlisted videos uploaded before 2017 to “Private” starting July 23. As a reminder, Private videos can only be seen by you and the people you choose. Once these videos are made Private starting July 23, any link previously used to embed or share them as Unlisted will no longer work.Opt out of this change. Fill out this form by July 23, 2021 to keep your Unlisted videos uploaded before 2017 in their current Unlisted state. If you treat your Unlisted videos like Public videos (e.g. they’re embedded on third party sites or shared on social media), we recommend you opt out of this change. If you choose to opt out, your existing links will continue working as they do today, but they won’t get the benefit of the security update. Make your Unlisted video public. You can make your Unlisted videos uploaded before 2017 “Public”, and they will be visible to anyone using YouTube.Reupload as a new Unlisted video. You can also reupload these older videos as Unlisted under the new system to benefit from the security update. However, data associated with the original upload, like views or comments, won’t transfer. Any embedded videos using the old link would also need to be updated to the new video URL. We understand that this change may be challenging, so we’re giving you time to make adjustments to your videos before it takes effect on July 23, 2021. These videos are not new and therefore receive less traffic, which we hope will minimize disruption.As a reminder, the Unlisted feature isn’t going anywhere. The option to upload new videos as Unlisted is still available. This update will affect only videos uploaded before January 1, 2017. We encourage YouTube creators to review their older Unlisted videos and choose the privacy setting that’s right for them.Google is rolling out a security update to YouTube and Drive.

As the realities of the pandemic set in, founder James Brown uploaded a video to YouTube to let their community know “We’re still here!” and open for business — pivoting from a wholesale model to selling online directly to customers. Ask Your Miller Monday They began uploading bread-baking tutorial videos, teaching bakers in the area how best to use their grains. Soon, their explainers and tutorial videos were being watched by people around the world, curious about sourdough starter, which flour to buy and how to use specialty grains. Over a year later, Barton Springs Mill continues to grow their channel with a variety of bread recipe videos and a weekly series titled, “Ask your Miller Mondays.” We’ve been astonished and heartened by stories from Barton Springs Mill’s and many others over the past year: small companies on YouTube showing remarkable resilience and innovating ways to connect with customers and grow their businesses.

But all too often, the portrayals we see are a portrait of a monolithic group. That’s a problem we wanted to address; we hope to use the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund to promote more authentic and varied perspectives and celebrate Black joy. When we announced the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund last year, we launched with the intention of investing in work that amplifies the voices, perspectives, and stories of Black people around the world. We wanted to equip Black creators and artists with the resources and support to enable them to thrive on YouTube. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made through our Class of 2021 grant program, YouTube Originals, and more. “ More than 132 creators & artist teams across six countries have participated in our inaugural three-week Black Voices Creator Fund Incubator Camps.” CELEBRATING OUR 2021 GRANTEESIn just seven months, our Class of 2021 creators and artists are increasing their impact and growing their channels because of the hard work they are putting in, the support they have received, and the dynamic communities they are continuing to build. Some of the highlights include: Each of our grantees has been partnered with a dedicated YouTube Strategic Partner manager who is working with them to optimize and grow their channels and we’ve already seen amazing results in channel growth and engagement.More than 132 creators & artist teams across six countries have participated in our inaugural three-week Black Voices Creator Fund Incubator Camps, where guest speakers covered everything from Pre-Production 101, lighting, and digital storytelling to alternative monetization, media coaching and wellbeing.

For example:Tassio from Herdeira da Beleza, hired a team and dedicated time to launch a podcast called SentidosDaBeleza (Senses of Beauty), the first podcast in Brazil about makeup for people with visual impairments.Terrell used his grant to upgrade his shooting space and launch a new cooking and comedy show called T and Coco.Tiffany from TiffanyRotheWorkouts purchased all new production equipment and hired an editor.

Already, students have started YouTube channels applying the learnings acquired through this program. Because of the program’s early success, we’ll be expanding Future Insiders globally, and will share more details later this year. “ One year ago, we 'put on our marathon shoes.'

Following are some highlights of work achieved along the way.  In January, we welcomed 21 artists to our inaugural Class of 2021, and through the resources we’ve provided -- dedicated one to one support, seed funding, and training and networking programs -- they have achieved incredible growth, not only on YouTube, but in their careers.

Even to this day – after 40 years working in music – my 90-year-old mother still asks me what I do for a living.I came to work for YouTube because I believe in its potential to help shepherd a golden age for the music business. I’m so proud to share that YouTube has paid over $4 billion to the music industry in the last 12 months alone and has added more paid members in Q1 ’21 than in any other quarter since launch. “ ... our goal is to become the leading revenue generator for the music industry and to help artists around the world build a career making music.” I’ve seen this industry evolve from an audio business, to an audio-visual business, and now – as my friend Chuck D puts it – to a visual-audio business. As a visual-audio platform, our goal is to become the leading revenue generator for the music industry and to help artists around the world build a career making music. We are uniquely positioned to achieve this goal because YouTube monetizes the end-to-end music experience globally: “ YouTube is the world’s largest stage, and advertisers are eager to tap into the deep music engagement that the platform enables.” Accelerating our twin-engine growth: Through our ad-supported free tier in 180 countries and subscription tiers in 96 countries, we give users the choice to pay with their attention or their wallets. YouTube is the world’s largest stage, and advertisers are eager to tap into the deep music engagement that the platform enables. With over 2 billion users watching music videos monthly, YouTube allows advertisers to reach audiences they can’t find anywhere else. In addition, we added more paid members in Q1 ’21 than in any other quarter in our history. Monetizing all music experiences: Music comes to life in so many ways across YouTube and YouTube Music. Both premium music content and user-generated content (UGC) are growing and driving significant value back to the industry. Whether it’s the premiere of the hottest new music video on your TV, a throwback playing on your Google Home when you ask for music that makes you smile, or the latest viral dance challenge, revenue is generated for artists, songwriters, and rights-holders. Growing viewership and revenue with unique fan content: Of the more than $4 billion generated for artists, songwriters, and rights-holders in the last 12 months, over 30% has come from UGC. Fan-powered videos have always flourished on YouTube, helping artists grow their audiences and break songs around the world. We’re thrilled it’s now also become a meaningful and incremental source of revenue alongside premium music content.Finding new sources of revenue: We’re continuing to innovate with direct-to-fan products such as ticketing, merch, memberships, paid digital goods, and virtual ticketed events. BLACKPINK’s paid virtual concert – THE SHOW – sold nearly 280,000 channel memberships across 81 countries and helped the group earn 2.7 million new subscribers to their official artist channel. “ These days when my mom asks me what I do for a living, I tell her I’m helping to make sure the next Kurt Cobain doesn’t have to become a dentist.” Building the best music experience for fans and empowering all artists to grow their careers are mission-critical for us. I couldn’t be more excited about the music industry’s future. These days when my mom asks me what I do for a living, I tell her I’m helping to make sure the next Kurt Cobain doesn’t have to become a dentist.With love and respect, Lyor Cohen"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/100th-anniversary-tulsa-massacre-conversation-cord-jefferson","date":"2021-05-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube News","News & Events"],"title":"100th Anniversary of the Tulsa Massacre: A conversation with Cord Jefferson","text":"Cord won an Emmy for his writing on “Watchmen,” the critically acclaimed HBO superhero drama that centered the 1921 Tulsa Massacre as a critical plot point. On the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Massacre, YouTube’s Malika Saada Saar sat down (virtually) with Cord to discuss the lines between history and fictional representation, the impact of generational trauma and the power of culture to educate and inspire.   The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. The massacre of Tulsa's \"Black Wall Street\" Cord, we are so grateful for your time today. The conversation around “Watchmen” has focused a lot on the series’ inclusion of the Tulsa Massacre as a central part of the story. Can you talk a bit about why the decision was made to focus on Tulsa and how that shaped the narrative of the show?Cord: The credit for that choice really goes to Damon Lindelof, who created the show. He read Ta-Nehisi Coates’ piece “The Case for Reparations” in The Atlantic, and despite being an incredibly well-read and well-educated guy, he realized he had never heard of the Tulsa Massacre before. He talked about it with friends and colleagues and realized that many people had never heard of it, either. When he came to look at adapting “Watchmen,” he was considering how to use a new lens on American history to create a fresh perspective on this comic book series from the 1980s. So we started to look at how to marry a real part of history that was largely unknown to so many people into this piece of genre fiction. We didn’t know that it would end up being the opening of the pilot episode of the show. Were there any concerns about opening the show with the Tulsa Massacre?Cord: There was a bit of fear, because there were so many eyeballs on this project, and “Watchmen” is such a beloved text for so many people. We knew that people were going to tune in expecting superheroes and instead we gave them a brutal, graphic depiction of a horrible moment in American history. It was actually a great introduction to the show -- you have people expecting one thing and give them another. It’s perhaps a bit polarizing, but that can be a good thing. People having different opinions can mean you’re on to something. Watchmen: Black Wall Street - Behind the Scenes of Season 1 | HBO And at the premiere of that episode, there was a spike in searches on Google for “Tulsa Massacre.” That conversation was beginning. Cord: “Watchmen” didn’t trend on Twitter that night, but “Tulsa” did. My friends were texting me to ask, “Is this real? Did you make this up? Were people really throwing fire bombs from the airplanes?” That was an important piece of it for us -- we wanted to make sure that the incidences of violence were not fabricated and everything we showed we could reference back to a book or an eyewitness account. The spike in Google searches was amazing, if a little scary. It is gratifying that we were able to expose people to that reality. Tulsa Race Massacre: Chapter 1; The Tulsa Race Massacre It shows the power of culture to educate people. I remember President Obama talking about the need to tell stories about people who have been previously incarcerated as a means to encourage criminal justice reform, and he said “culture eats politics for breakfast every day.” How do you think about using culture and the public square as a way of sharing this denied part of our history?Cord: I wish that the Tulsa Massacre was being taught more in America’s public education system. It should be part of the curriculum. I’m not going to take credit for things that happened after “Watchmen,” but after our show, the state of Oklahoma finally made it mandatory to teach about the Tulsa Massacre in high school. “Watchmen” isn’t solely responsible for that, but I do believe that fiction helps to move the needle. I’m incredibly proud if our show helped to expose more people to this dark chapter and to step in with my colleagues to try and fill in some blind spots. But TV shouldn’t take the place of the public school system -- most Americans do not have access to HBO, but most children have access to the public school system. Survivors share the truth of horrific 1921 Tulsa massacre: Part 1 When it comes to racial violence and generational trauma, part of what white supremacy does is mask and hide the violence that has been done and because of that, there is no way to heal properly. Can you talk a bit about how that played out between the characters of Angela and the man she discovers is her grandfather, Will? In the episode you won an Emmy for, “This Extraordinary Being,” we discover Will’s back story as a superhero through Angela’s eyes as she experiences Will’s memories in a lucid dream. Cord: There is a famous quote from Malcolm X that talks about the knife in your back -- that you can’t remove the knife and heal if they won’t even acknowledge that the knife is there. I related to the generational trauma between Angela and Will through my own father. My father wasn’t a victim of racial violence the way that Will is in the show, but my father went to Vietnam and came back with very serious PTSD. At the time, this condition didn’t have a name; they just called it “shellshock.” He did his best to white-knuckle through the worst of it, but he never saw a therapist and never had psychiatric treatment. Now, 50 years later, he’s coming to terms with how much of an impact Vietnam had on him, and I’m looking at how much Vietnam had an impact on my relationship with him. He was always closed off, there was something simmering below but he never talked about it. As a result, I grew up with resentment. He and I are now in family therapy together, and we’re learning about how much of our issues belong to the trauma that was inflicted on him in Vietnam. I was thinking about all of this while I was writing that episode. I imagined what it would be like if I could see my dad when he was 22 years old as a scared kid on a boat to Vietnam, and how differently I would feel about him if I could see that. And through the process of writing this episode, my anger towards him melted away and I understood he was a young man doing what he thought he was supposed to do for his country, and then he came back and no one helped him. These are the themes of that episode -- how the things that affected us in the past affect us still in the future, and affect the generations down the line. It’s something people don’t talk about in this country, especially when it comes to Black people. People say, “Slavery was 400 years ago, why can’t you get over it?” You can’t because there are still repercussions in America today. I can see how that intergenerational trauma from slavery and Jim Crow laws still play out today and have an effect on Black Americans. This was one of the most important and exciting themes we addressed in the show. The only way you are going to heal from something is to address it and acknowledge it, and take some direct action against it. Unfortunately there are huge swathes of people trying to banish discussions of race in school, banish things like the 1619 Project, who want to erase our past. But if we want to heal, at a bare minimum we need to acknowledge it. With today marking the 100th anniversary of the massacre, can you share with us some of the resources you have used to learn more about Tulsa? There are a lot of resources on YouTube, like Vox’s The massacre of Tulsa's \"Black Wall Street\" or the Tulsa Public Schools’ multi-part series Tulsa Race Massacre, but what are your go-to sources? Cord: Two key sources I would recommend are The Burning: The Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, by Tim Madigan, and The Case for Reparations by Ta-Nehisi Coates. But it’s important to realize that Tulsa was not a unique incident -- I’d encourage folks to look into the Rosewood massacre, any number of other episodes of racial violence in America’s history. People might be shocked to learn that Tulsa wasn’t a one-time thing and then everything got better. There was a series of these terrorist attacks around the country for decades. There’s more out there to keep learning about to help you understand America’s history. The key to growth is acknowledging these things in the first place. It’s to our peril if we don’t."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/white-house-youtube-town-hall","date":"2021-05-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Health","News & Events"],"title":"President Biden and Dr. Fauci join YouTube creators Jackie Aina, MannyMUA and Brave Wilderness to discuss COVID-19 vaccines and debunk myths","text":"It’s not every day you get to collab with the President of the United States, but that’s what YouTube creators Jackie Aina, Manny Mua, and Brave Wilderness got to experience last week, as they sat down virtually with President Joe Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci to address top questions from their audiences about COVID-19 vaccination. “ What I want is for my audience to be informed. I want them to have resources and accurate information about the vaccine, if they want to get vaccinated!” MannyMUA Each of the creators had a chance to chat individually with President Biden and Dr. Fauci, and the discussions ranged from the development and availability of vaccines to what one skincare product the President would take on a deserted island (he wisely chose sunscreen!) “ We hope our audience makes the best decisions for themselves, their families and the greater community. We want to provide a forum of information that will help society make that decision.” Mark Vins, Brave Wilderness This is an important moment in our fight against COVID-19, as all Americans aged 12+ are now eligible to get their vaccine. As a father of young kids and a doctor, I believe that it’s critical that we help motivate younger people to consider getting their shot. We need to inspire, educate and motivate younger audiences about vaccination with a message of hope that a post-pandemic world can look like it did before, with hugs, movie theaters and traveling with friends -- if we all work to be part of the solution. That’s why all of us at YouTube are focused on ensuring that everyone has access to credible information about COVID-19 vaccines on our platform. We want to make sure you hear from diverse voices who bring unique perspectives and questions to the discussion of vaccines, to help you make an informed decision about what’s best for you and your family. YouTube has also paired health experts from around the world, including experts from the Center for Disease Control and the White House, with everyone from music artists to comedians to fashion icons to FarmTubers for interviews around COVID and vaccine safety. To date, more than 60+ of these collaboration videos have been completed, with a reach of more than 65 million views.A recent campaign called Get Back to What You Love further invests in inspiring younger Americans to learn about the COVID-19 vaccines by reminding them of all we have to look forward to in a post-pandemic world. The campaign is being promoted on YouTube, broadcast TV, radio, paid social media with the goal of reaching 180M users in the United States by the end of July, serving over 2.5B impressions.People come to YouTube because of creators like MannyMUA, Jackie Aina and Brave Wilderness, who have not only built engaged communities around the world, but who provide resources and information during crucial moments. The authentic and relatable creative approaches they take play an important role in helping public health experts reimagine the ways health information can be shared. These videos exemplify how creators are helping to make public health information, truly public."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/mental-health-day-action-take-first-step-toward-better-mental-health","date":"2021-05-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","News & Events"],"title":"Mental Health Day of Action: Take the first step toward better mental health","text":"There is no doubt that COVID-19 has impacted our mental health in addition to our physical health. Last month in the U.S. we saw spikes in fatigue-related Google searches, and the question “why do I feel bad?” reached a record high.

Over 120 million people streamed YouTube or YouTube TV on their TV screens last December in the U.S.1 Why is YouTube people's Main Stream? YouTube makes people feel happy, connected, and empowered -- and that's never been a more important halo for brands.Today, at our tenth annual NewFront event, Brandcast Delivered, we brought advertisers together, virtually, to celebrate the content people need and the creators they love — as well as the brands who are making the most of the opportunity. Hosted by Hasan Minhaj, advertisers received personalized experiences based on their specific passions and business objectives. The show featured multi-platinum selling recording artist, songwriter and trailblazer, Miley Cyrus, and fan-favorite creators like Tarek Ali and ZHC. Plus, we shared key announcements, like new interactive ad features for the TV screen, original content and a celebration of this year’s YouTube Works award winners. See the top takeaways below. Top brands are seeing results with YouTube at the heart of their plansYouTube continues to generate greater incremental sales per impression than TV and other online video in virtually all MMMs. In an MMM meta-analysis we commissioned with Nielsen, YouTube had greater incremental sales per impression than TV in 91% of CPG MMMs that measured YouTube, Other Digital and TV in 2017-2019.2During today’s show, we also celebrated the winners of this year’s YouTube Works awards — representing the most creative and effective campaigns across YouTube. Earning a total of three awards, including the Grand Prix, Match embraced humor with their “Match Made in Hell” campaign, gaining a 40% increase in consideration. Brands like Comedy Central took home the award for Big Screen, Big Results by effectively capturing attention on TV screens. And other brands, like Adobe, got creative with a completely digital film festival, which also drove sales.

As YouTube CTV reach and watch time grows, we’re bringing new interactive features As viewership shifts away from linear TV and the number of streaming services increase, the CTV market might seem fragmented. But in reality, more than 80% of CTV reach in the U.S. falls on only five streaming services, according to Comscore — and only two are ad-supported. As the #1 ad-supported streaming service, YouTube represents 40% of that watch time, according to Comscore. And more and more, people are choosing to watch their favorite content with others. According to Talk Shoppe, over half of Americans (57%) surveyed say they watch YouTube videos on TV screens with others.4 This means brands can easily extend their overall reach and impact of their campaigns.To help brands better reach highly-engaged audiences where they are watching and access the most popular content on TV screens, we launched YouTube Select CTV last year. It combines the best of YouTube TV and lineups content, both on TV screens, with a single offering.New this year, we’re making YouTube CTV ads even more helpful for viewers and more engaging for brands with interactive features, like brand extensions. Brand extensions, available globally later this year, invite viewers to learn more about a product with one click of a button, without interrupting their viewing experience. Video format not supported Brands will be able to measure conversions generated by brand extensions, directly in Google Ads.

In addition to upfront exclusive sponsorships like NFL Game Day All Access — recently nominated for a Sports Emmy — we’re also offering a rolling set of seasonal sponsorships available on a quarterly basis. Our seasonal sponsorship offering celebrates diverse communities and the movements and moments that matter, like Black History Month or Pride.

From actors to musicians, make-up artists to comedians, and DJs to designers, the community influences the cultural fabric of America and the world beyond. It’s been a horrific year of increased racism and violence against Asians and Pacific Islanders, and it certainly weighs heavily on all of us. And for many in this community, words aren’t enough. So we’d like to take this opportunity -- this month of May -- to do something that educates, uplifts and inspires: This Asian Pacific American Heritage Month (APAHM), we’re showcasing the stories and creativity of API creators and artists on the YouTube Spotlight channel and across the platform. Watch Anna Akana, Steve Aoki, Hasan Minhaj, Amanda Rach Lee and many more share what it was like growing up and living in North America -- juggling multiple cultures, languages and customs. How it helped them discover their own voices and perspectives. And how all of it has made them the talented humans they are today. It’s undeniable how rich and expansive the API community’s body of work is -- so we’re just here to surface it even more. Below is a sneak peek of some of the additional celebratory content you will see across YouTube over the course of this month. YouTube MusicYouTube Music is honoring APAHM with a flagship playlist titled “Celebrating APAHM” featuring both emerging and iconic Asian American artists. You can catch rising artist AUDREY NUNA on the cover of “Celebrating APAHM” this week and on YouTube’s Spotlight channel alongside Eric Nam, Raja Kumari, keshi and more artists. Over the course of the month, fans can also enjoy several other YouTube Music playlists that showcase Asian artists across the diaspora and their extensive contributions to music and culture. Additionally, you can tune into one of our upcoming episodes of RELEASED to catch some special API programming. RELEASED drops every Thursday night at 11:45 p.m. ET. YouTube KidsYouTube Kids will feature “AAPI Storytime” videos from The Conscious Kid and Wong Fu Productions, with children’s books celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage and culture, read aloud by celebrities like Harry Shum Jr. Videos will be released weekly through May on The Conscious Kid’s YouTube channel and in the learning section of the YouTube Kids app. YouTube LearningYouTube Learning will launch two playlists to celebrate APAHM.

From day one, we’ve worked to listen to your feedback to improve the experience, bring the content providers you enjoy and make the app available on as many devices as possible. We’ve been working with Roku to renew our deal to distribute YouTube TV on their devices. Despite our best efforts to come to an agreement in the best interests of our mutual users, Roku terminated our deal in bad faith amidst our negotiation. Unfortunately, Roku has often engaged in this tactic with other streaming providers. The most important thing for us is to make sure you are taken care of, and that the experience of our shared users is a good one. As we post this, existing users still have access to YouTube TV on Roku devices. We encourage Roku not to remove the YouTube TV app so that existing users can continue enjoying the service. We wanted to explain how we have been negotiating in good faith on behalf of our YouTube TV members:Our initial conversations started with Roku simply to renew the current terms of their ongoing deal with YouTube TV, which has been in place for several years. Our offer to Roku was simple and still stands: renew the YouTube TV deal under the existing reasonable terms. However, Roku chose to use this as an opportunity to renegotiate a separate deal encompassing the YouTube main app, which does not expire until December. Our agreements with partners have technical requirements to ensure a high quality experience on YouTube. Roku requested exceptions that would break the YouTube experience and limit our ability to update YouTube in order to fix issues or add new features. For example, by not supporting open-source video codecs, you wouldn’t be able to watch YouTube in 4K HDR or 8K even if you bought a Roku device that supports that resolution. We can’t give Roku special treatment at the expense of users. To be clear, we have never, as they have alleged, made any requests to access user data or interfere with search results. This claim is baseless and false.We understand the concern members may have about this and we don’t take this lightly. We are committed to ensuring our members continue to have access to YouTube TV and will continue advocating on behalf of our members."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/covid-19-vaccines-get-back-what-you-love","date":"2021-04-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Health","News & Events"],"title":"COVID-19 Vaccines: Get back to what you love","text":"Hugging your grandparents. Traveling with friends. Having family over for the holidays. Seeing co-workers in person. These are just some of the things people around the world are eager to get back to doing as we aim to return to a more normal way of life. Today we’re excited to launch the first chapter of a public service announcement series in partnership with the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine to encourage people to get informed about the vaccine and also remind us of all that we have to look forward to in a post-pandemic world. The campaign will launch in the U.S. today and roll out to other countries in the weeks to come and coincide with the local vaccine availability timelines. A year ago, the idea that things could return to normal felt distant — maybe even impossible. But since then, COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and are now becoming more readily available every day, such as in the U.S. where vaccines are now available to all 16+. The light at the end of the tunnel is starting to feel closer.The pandemic has been a time of great uncertainty, fear, and anxiety for so many people, so it’s natural for people to be cautious about another aspect of the pandemic: multiple new vaccines. In fact, the theme of this past year — if it had to be summed up in a single word — could be “caution.” And that’s a good thing. Caution has saved lives. People have been cautious when it comes to protecting their health, the health of their loved ones, and the health of their communities amidst the pandemic. The next step in that caution is trusting the science and listening to the advice of health authorities about getting vaccinated so that we can continue to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities for the long term. At YouTube, we are committed to making sure that people have access to reliable information about the vaccine, including how it was developed and tested, what they can expect when they get the vaccine, and how every person plays a part in the public’s health. Hearing inaccurate information can breed doubt in someone’s mind and that’s why trusted scientific and medical organizations are partnering with YouTube to make sure credible information is reaching people in accessible and culturally relevant ways.The videos for our PSA campaign will run across YouTube, as well as on television, radio and paid social posts through July, with the goal of reaching Americans between the ages of 18 to 34, a key demographic to help control the spread of the virus. To watch the full series of PSA videos, and additional content from local health authorities, visit youtube.com/vaccineinfo.We are not only focused on ensuring the public has access to credible information, but also ensuring that information is delivered through diverse voices who bring unique perspectives and experiences. We are pairing health experts from around the world with everyone from music artists to comedians to fashion icons to FarmTubers to help reach users in new ways and unearth the hard questions around COVID vaccine safety and efficacy. Let’s all get informed and listen to the experts urging us to get vaccinated so we can get back to what we love."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/celebrating-our-humans-earth-day","date":"2021-04-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","YouTube News","News & Events"],"title":"Celebrating our Humans of Earth Day","text":"Happy Earth Day!

Since the launch of YouTube 16 years ago, our platform has been a place where people come together, and we see this more than ever during difficult times. In times of social unrest, YouTube is a place where people come to make their voices heard, find community, and advocate for change. You may have seen some recent reporting about our ad placement process that suggests that YouTube prevents advertisers from running campaigns targeting social issues and movements like Black Lives Matter. We want to make two things clear:Videos about topics like Black Lives Matter, Black culture, and Black excellence, can and do monetize on YouTube, along with topics related to a wide range of social justice issues. We do not allow targeting of advertising against hateful terms. Content that is hateful towards Black and other marginalized communities, including videos with themes of “white nationalism” or other offensive topics, are not eligible to monetize on YouTube. And when we find this content on our platform, we remove it. But while our policies are clear, our systems sometimes fall short, though we work quickly to correct them. We want to clarify how our ad placement system works, and address the issue at the heart of these concerns, which is what kinds of content are able to earn revenue on YouTube.This is how the ad placement tool works. Advertisers enter words or phrases, the tool then suggests videos that could be related to the terms they search. The tool has no impact on which content can or cannot monetize. Reporters entered offensive terms to see which ones returned suggestions. Though our system did block many hate terms, we failed to catch some others. We regret that these terms were searchable in our ad placement tool and have corrected this gap. But we want to be clear: this does not mean that the videos that surfaced were eligible to run advertising, or that advertisers can run campaigns connected to those offensive terms -- and in fact, neither of these things happened. And much of the content that was suggested was news stories related to those issues, and not hateful content. We’ve also had some questions about why terms that are not hateful or harmful were blocked in the ad placement tool. Search terms may be blocked because we have detected the potential for abuse, such as creators seeking to run ads against another creator’s channel to showcase an opposing viewpoint. At times, we may block terms, even temporarily, that seem counterintuitive, but it is done to protect our creators, our community, and promote user safety. We will continue to take action to dismantle embedded racism on our platform. We have hundreds of employees working on social justice efforts every day and we’re committed to tackling these issues over the long term.A critical part of our commitment to social justice has been to ensure that creators can build thriving channels on our platform, earning revenue to sustain their businesses and their creativity. Many advertisers have made public commitments to support diversity and racial equity. Similarly, their customers come to YouTube to watch content on these topics and to hear from creators. To help ensure that creators are able to earn the full value from their videos, we have been partnering with our advertisers and their agencies to help them expand their advertising campaigns on YouTube to reach wider and more diverse audiences, by reviewing their Brand Suitability settings such as their keyword exclusions. We also have a dedicated Multicultural Strategy & Sales team whose remit is Advertiser Cultural Effectiveness, with a focus on increasing revenue opportunities for diverse creators and meeting inclusive advertising goals for advertisers via our premium CultureLab service, which delivers culture-first and privacy-first insights, inclusive creative best practices and inclusive media solutions. Black creators and artists have and continue to play an important role in shaping the culture on YouTube, propelling our platform forward. We are invested in these creators, artists, and their stories. And we will continue to ensure that they can succeed on YouTube."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/susan-wojcicki-and-molly-burke-conversation-about-free-expression","date":"2021-04-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","Creators","News & Events"],"title":"Susan Wojcicki and Molly Burke: A conversation about free expression","text":"Susan sat down with Molly Burke to receive a Free Expression Award from the Freedom Forum Institute and discuss YouTube’s commitment to responsibly protecting our community while also providing a space for free expression. Watch their conversation here: Transcript:Molly Burke: I'm so excited to be here tonight to present Susan Wojcicki with the Free Expression Award. As the CEO of YouTube, Susan is facing some of the most critical issues around free expression today. When billions of people are on your platform every day, how do you make sure that everybody has a voice, but also feels safe? And how do you do that across the versions of YouTube that exist in a hundred different countries and 80 different languages? These questions are important to me because YouTube is where I found my voice. You might not be able to tell by looking at me, but I'm blind. I lost the majority of my vision when I was 14. And that year, it felt like my life was falling apart until I found a group of girls, online, who loved beauty and fashion as much as I do. When I no longer had friends in real life to turn to, I found these online creators to turn to, and they felt like my friends. I knew that one day I wanted to be able to build that same sense of community for other people around the world who felt like they didn't fit in. And six years ago, that's what I did. Now, every single day, I get to share my story and advocate for a world that's more accessible for everyone. YouTube gave me that opportunity. And every day YouTube gives people the opportunity to express themselves and the freedom to feel like they have somewhere that they belong. The freedom that YouTube gave me is so important to me, and I'm so grateful. And that's why I feel honored to introduce to you Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. She's been called one of the most powerful women in technology today, but for creators around the world, we just know her as Susan. Susan, I'm so honored to be able to present you tonight with a Free Expression Award for your incredible leadership with YouTube. And I just want to say thank you for all the work that you've done to empower people around the world to share their story. And I'm thrilled to be able to ask you some questions about your perspective on free expression.Susan Wojcicki: Thank you, Molly. Thank you so much for being here and joining me here tonight. Molly Burke Molly: Now I know that your passion for free speech has been in part impacted due to your family's history. Can you share how your family's experience has shaped your ideas of free speech?Susan: Sure. Well, so on both sides of my family, they came to the United States because of the need -- or different kinds of persecution. On my father's side, it was due to political persecution. My father came from Poland and for a variety of reasons after World War II, it became important for them to leave. And my father escaped from Poland and wound up coming to the United States. And, you know, my grandfather was never able to leave. He remained in Poland and was behind the Iron Curtain, and I saw how difficult it was to communicate with him, to be able – to worry about what you were saying to him and for him to have concerns about what was said or what was even sent to him. And then, on my mother's side, they came to the United States for religious persecution. And so I've just seen the real benefits that freedom of speech has as well as representing all people of all different backgrounds and all different perspectives and that the freedoms we have, we really can't take for granted. That we really have to make sure that we're protecting them in every way possible. And I feel, because of my family history, a deep connection to those freedoms. And I'm very thankful for the freedoms that I have.Molly: Absolutely, as we all should be. Now when I started on YouTube, all I really wanted to do was just be authentic and share my story. But of course, as I've grown, there's been more pressure to speak for others in my community. And with that becomes a lot of responsibility. And I know at YouTube, you guys are always juggling responsibility at such a high level, always needing to try to balance people's right to free speech with protecting our community from content that can be harmful. So can you talk to us a little about that? Susan: Sure. Well, first of all, we want to be able to have as diverse and open a platform as possible and represent as many views as possible on the platform, but we also need to make sure that there are limits and that we can see that sometimes that we've always, since the very beginning of YouTube, have had Community Guidelines, because we've realized that there are certain types of content. Like since the very beginning we wouldn't allow adult content, hate content, dangerous content. All of those types of content could really make it that YouTube was no longer a platform that was viable for all these other voices out there. And so we've always had Community Guidelines, but as YouTube has become bigger and has had more of an impact, we've seen the need to increase what we're doing from a responsibility standpoint. And this has been an area of increasing importance for us as we have certainly gotten bigger and we call this whole work -- the responsibility work. And we actually talk about the four R's of responsibility. It involves literally thousands of people and a large amount of work across the entire company. But if I sum it into these four different Rs, the first one would be Remove, which is that we're always updating our policies and when content is violative of any of the policies, unfortunately, we need to remove it. And so we removed 9 million videos last quarter and almost all of them – over 90% – we removed with machines, which is good because it means if there's content that's violative, we find that really quickly. And the second one is Raise -- so being able to raise up authoritative information. So for example, in the pandemic we served hundreds of billions of impressions that came from different health organizations, like whether it was the CDC or the equivalent and countries all over the world and making sure that people get information from the right medical sources in the case of COVID or news from authoritative sources. So we're working to make sure that we can raise up the information that we -- is valuable for our users. And then, you know, there's a lot of content that technically meets the spirit of what we're trying to do, but it is -- it's borderline. And so for that content, we'll just Reduce, meaning we're not going to recommend it to our users. It's still on the platform, but it's content that is not necessarily recommended by our platform. And the last one is Reward, which is that we have a higher standard for where we serve our advertising dollars. And that has many reasons why we want to, you know, we want to do the right thing for our advertisers and they care a lot where their ads show up, but we also want to protect creators like you who have built businesses with really, really valuable content and make sure that you're -- that we don't have a situation where advertisers pulled their spend because there's some content on it that they're not comfortable with. So we want to make sure we're protecting all the valuable creators like you. So those are the four Rs of responsibility that we think about as we are -- as YouTube is growing and we're continuing to invest. And it's been a huge priority for me at YouTube to make sure that we are balancing the openness of YouTube, but also the responsibility.Molly: That's fantastic. I think all of those are very valuable steps that YouTube has taken. And I'm curious to hear how you feel free speech plays out on YouTube with creativity.Susan: Well, first of all, I think that YouTube has really enabled a lot more creativity, and I think it's amazing we have creators like you on the platform and that we can hear from you -- from different perspectives that we probably wouldn't have heard with traditional media. And I also just look over my lifetime. So when I was a kid, I remember there were just, I don't know – not that many channels! Probably less than a hundred at the most channels. And maybe when I was a teenager, there were a couple hundred. And now with YouTube, we have millions and millions of channels, and that has just unleashed a huge number of different views and perspectives. And we can hear from people that we never would have heard from beforehand.Molly: Absolutely. Thank you, Susan, for chatting with me and congrats on your very well-deserved award.Susan: Thank you so much to the Freedom Forum for having me here today. And for this award, I recognize the significance of freedom of speech, and I'm so honored to be here today to receive this award."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/justin-bieber-live-from-paris-concert-justice","date":"2021-04-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","Artists","News & Events"],"title":"Justin Bieber’s ‘Live From Paris’ concert special is happening tonight, only on YouTube","text":"Tonight, Grammy® Award-winning global superstar and the #1 most-subscribed-to artist on YouTube, Justin Bieber,will be performing songs from his #1 album, “JUSTICE” for the first time on his “Live from Paris” concert special.

Watching the live streaming space evolve over the years from a lean-back experience to an interactive, intimate, best-seat-in-the-house... has been pretty incredible. But nothing could have prepared me for the past year. Post Malone x Nirvana Tribute - Livestream As COVID hit and the world shut down, people came together like never before, and much of that happened right here on YouTube. Fans tuned in to connect with their favorite artists, and artists leaned right in to feel closer to fans, using YouTube as their virtual venue. We watched legendary artists like Elton John, Grateful Dead, Radiohead, The National and many other new and iconic artists release concerts from the vault, giving fans that nostalgia they needed while staying safely at home. Others like Post Malone, Rei Ami, The Roots and Yungblud served up new music and content, even from their own living rooms. Brittany Howard - Live from Ryman Auditorium (#SOSFEST​) Almost a year ago to the day, we witnessed Andrea Bocelli’s groundbreaking live moment from “Music for Hope: Live from the Duomo.” Soon after, Global Citizen’s “One World Together at Home” live event brought the world to tears. Later in the year, YouTube and NIVA (the National Independent Venues Association) joined hands for #SOSFEST, a three-day virtual music fest that raised over $2 million to help Save Our Stages. We brought 35 artists and crews back into 25 U.S. independent venues, safely, to perform for fans -- many for the first time since doors were closed. These music experiences have helped keep people around the world hopeful and bonded in a time of need. What has emerged and become clear is that YouTube is the world’s biggest virtual stage and live streams are not just a trend. The desire for artists and fans to stay connected through music is constant and as they continue to creatively adapt to the times. Radiohead, January 16, 2008. (Photo Credit: Andy Willsher) This morning Radiohead announced their second series of live archival shows to be streamed on YouTube from the Radiohead Public Library vaults. Following up their archival concert releases from last year, each new edition will Premiere on Radiohead’s Official YouTube channel on Fridays at 8 p.m. British Summer Time (BST), for the next 7 weeks. The first of the new episodes premiering this Friday will be a seldom-seen January 16, 2008 impromptu club gig at London’s 93 FeetEast. This is just one example of how one of the world’s most legendary bands has created a way for their fans to relive and rediscover some of their most rare musical moments all together. We’ve seen live stream music content flourish in many forms. We’ve made it a point to educate artists and their teams about the variety of ways they can connect with their fans, while also enhancing our features to enrich the experience. In January of this year, we partnered with BLACKPINK for their first-ever virtual concert experience, THE SHOW. This paid, interactive concert experience used a slightly modified version of our Channel Memberships feature, and it brought fans from more than 80 countries around the world together. Fans could dance, sing, chat and scream with excitement as their favorite group performed from an arena in Seoul, Korea. It was next level! We’ve witnessed an evolution in the live space... artists getting more comfortable live streaming from anywhere, venues getting wired for live, fans watching on their TVs and on mobile. My hope is that when the world opens up again, artists will continue to live stream as a way to reach all of their fans in far-off places that they might not have reached otherwise. That first moment back on stage in front of a crowd should be one that every fan across the world gets to experience -- the fans who have been here, tuning in, supporting, listening and watching together, all along."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/hip-hop-and-advertising","date":"2021-03-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Ads","News & Events"],"title":"If you don't know, now you know","text":"I remember the first time I ever heard “Juicy” by Notorious B.I.G. DJ Peter Johns, who always had the latest songs, played it, and I knew the sample from my dad’s records. A line in that song goes: “You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far” stood out, and it stays true to this day. The growth of hip-hop continues to blow the minds of those who love it and follow it closely.The year 2020 was hard, but that challenge didn’t stop the music. And it didn’t stop fans from connecting and engaging with artists on YouTube, particularly in hip-hop. Artists broke new records and released empowering anthems. Despite the pandemonium of the pandemic, over 2 billion viewers logged in and watched a music video each month on YouTube. The genre that stood out during that time: hip-hop. “ ... of the top three genres on YouTube in the U.S. ... hip-hop is the fastest growing” Now we gotta back up that claim. Well, here are some facts: of the top three genres on YouTube in the U.S. — hip-hop, rock and pop — hip-hop is the fastest growing.1 And between October through December 2020, hip-hop was the most-viewed music genre on YouTube in the U.S.2 Finally, hip-hop artists occupied all 10 spots in YouTube’s top 10 most-viewed artists in the U.S. list last year, meaning its influence on culture is not just here to stay, it’s increasing. Facts!Back to “Juicy” for a second. There’s another line that says “reach for the stars.” We are the world’s largest and most comprehensive music platform and we recognize where viewers are spending their time. We’re also here to help advertisers reach music fans. The rise of hip-hop on YouTube presents advertisers with a tremendous opportunity to reach music fans where they’re watching, and support diverse creators and artists. That’s why we’ve introduced an expanded YouTube Select music lineup that includes even more popular, verified hip-hop music. We’re also adding more hip-hop artists to our dynamic hip-hop music lineups across the globe. In January, we launched the #YouTubeBlack Voices grant program as part of our global, multi-year commitment to center and grow Black creators and artists on our platform. The grant program is an initiative dedicated to equipping and amplifying Black creators and artists with the resources to succeed on our platform. We’re adding the artists from the Black Voices Class of 2021 to existing dynamic music lineups for advertisers to buy. Levi’s® is leveraging the dynamic hip-hop music lineup and videos from the Black Voices Class of 2021 to promote its independent film, “Beauty of Becoming,” an inspirational story from filmmaker Oge Egbuonu that challenges us all to be our most authentic selves.Meanwhile, advertisers like BET are seeing tremendous success from their investments in hip-hop music content on YouTube. BET leveraged the rap and hip-hop dynamic lineup and other relevant contextual and audience-based solutions to drive 4% lift in consideration and 21% lift in searches for the 2020 BET hip-hop Awards. We’re proud to offer brands more opportunities to reach hip hop fans on YouTube, and support diverse creators and artists at the same time.

Now that effective vaccines have been approved by many health authorities around the world, the focus has shifted toward two new challenges: ensuring access to vaccines for everyone, and ensuring that as many people as possible actually get vaccinated when it is offered.  As we’ve discovered throughout the pandemic, effective communication is a crucial part of improving public health. When it comes to our global vaccination efforts, building confidence and trust in these new vaccines will be the difference maker that ends the pandemic and allows a return to normal life. YouTube is committed to leveraging our platform’s reach (2B+ monthly logged-in viewers) and the diversity of the YouTube creator community, to help make the science of COVID-19 vaccines easy to understand and more accessible to people all over the world. This is a pivotal moment in history and in public health, and we are deeply invested in ensuring we meet the moment as the platform where the world comes to watch and learn.  We will do this in three ways: First, we’ll continue to raise up authoritative information from Local Health Authorities and community-based health organizations. Second, we are investing in a new, multimillion-dollar campaign to address vaccine hesitancy in countries around the world. And lastly, we will build on our success to-date in connecting our creators with trusted health experts to reimagine how vaccine information is shared. Highly visible information from local health authorities Since March 2020, we have worked closely with more than 85 local health authorities and public health experts across the world, and have created highly visible methods of sharing information from public health authorities across YouTube. We’re continuing these efforts as the pandemic evolves to share information about the development, safety and efficacy of the vaccines. All of this is making an impact -- our authoritative partner content and COVID-19 information panels on YouTube have been viewed 400B times, making them an important source of authoritative information. In addition to these efforts to share vaccine information to a broad audience, we have also sharpened our focus on communities who are most at-risk and most in need of this critical — and in some cases — life-saving public health information.   We are working with a wide range of partners who have experience and expertise in public health communication with key at-risk groups, to help create, amplify and promote their campaigns on YouTube, including the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Greater Than COVID video campaign, featuring their series for Black America and two upcoming series that seek to reach both the Latinx community and low-income rural communities across America; and the Black Coalition Against COVID-19 and Black Doctor Org video series to help answer top questions from the Black community about COVID and vaccines. New campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy We’re excited to share today that we will be working with the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine towards an upcoming global campaign that will feature the personal stories of people getting vaccinated and help to remind us of all we have to look forward to as a vaccinated world recovers from the pandemic. YouTube is also working with Global Citizen on a global special, airing in May 2021, that will focus on overcoming vaccine hesitancy and ensuring equitable distribution. Additional details of this global special will be announced in the coming weeks. “ To date, more than 60+ of these collaboration videos have been completed, which have received more than 65M views.” Reimagining ways to share public health information  People come to YouTube because of the creators and artists who they have developed connections with, and we believe creators have an important role to play in helping public health experts to reimagine the ways in which health information has traditionally been shared.  That’s why we’re expanding our efforts to connect influential creators and artists with relatable, trusted scientists and public health experts for thoughtful, science-based but ultimately engaging and compelling videos that will answer the questions that are top of mind for each creator’s unique audience. To date, more than 60+ of these collaboration videos have been completed, which have received more than 65M views. We’re building on the success of conversations like the ones between Dr. Fauci and Monica, CDC officer TIa Rogers and Asia Jackson, and Andy Slavitt and Jim Gaffigan, to connect with more audiences, ranging from rural and farming communities to family vloggers.   In fact, YouTube creators have been so successful in reaching their audiences with COVID-19 health messages that President Emmanuel Macron of France issued a challenge to creators Carlito and McFly that if they could create a video about COVID safety that reached 10M views, he would invite them to the Elysée Palace for a Q&A. Their video, a hilarious musical tribute to COVID safety measures, hit 10M views in just three days, showing how a creative approach can share helpful information in ways that are relatable, digestible and easily accessible. Dr. Garth Graham Additionally, we have a large and growing community of YouTube creators who are also clinicians. These creators are an invaluable part of our ecosystem and have large audiences who depend on them for credible information about a number of health questions, including COVID-19 vaccination.  We’re also continuing to rigorously enforce our policies against misinformation related to COVID-19. To-date, we have removed over 850K videos for violating these policies, including more than 30K since the last quarter of 2020 that specifically violated our policy on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.  With the effects of the pandemic still being felt around the world, we’re constantly evolving our priorities to meet the changing needs of our global community. This is the first step in our vaccination education work with much more in the works for the coming months. “Our work at the Vaccine Confidence Project is focused on monitoring and identifying the levels of public confidence and trust in vaccination -- work that has been brought into sharp relief with the rollout of new COVID-19 vaccines. We are excited to collaborate with YouTube on a global education campaign to help address vaccine hesitancy and help to remind us all of what we have to look forward to as a vaccinated world recovers from the pandemic.\" (Professor Heidi Larson, Director of The Vaccine Confidence Project)"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-shorts-united-states","date":"2021-03-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"Bringing YouTube Shorts to the U.S.","text":"Last September, we announced that we are building YouTube Shorts, a short-form video experience for anyone who wants to create short, catchy videos using nothing but their mobile phones. Since introducing our initial beta in India, we’ve already started to see creators having fun with Shorts, and the number of Indian channels using our creation tools has more than tripled since the beginning of December alone. People are also watching more and more Shorts around the globe - the YouTube Shorts player has now surpassed 6.5 billion daily views globally.  Starting today and over the next several weeks, we’ll gradually expand our Shorts beta to the U.S. We plan to introduce more features as we continue to build Shorts alongside creators and artists. Here’s an update on where we’re headed with YouTube Shorts based on feedback from our community. Unlocking a new playground of creativityWith our Shorts beta in India, we had foundational creation tools, like a multi-segment camera to string multiple video clips together, the ability to record with music, control speed settings, and more. And today we’re adding more features, like the ability to add text to specific points in your video. You’ll also be able to sample audio from other Shorts so you can remix it into your own creation. Same Moves Different Energy ⚡️ #shorts​ Same Moves Different Energy ⚡️ #shorts​ In the coming months, we’ll launch the ability to use audio from videos across YouTube - which includes billions of videos worldwide - unlocking a new playground of creativity like never before. This means you can give your own creative spin on the content you love to watch on YouTube and help find it a new audience — whether it’s reacting to your favorite jokes, trying your hand at a creator’s latest recipe, or re-enacting comedic skits. Creators will be in control and will be able to opt out if they don’t want their long form video remixed. We’ve also worked alongside our music partners to make sure artists and creators have a large library of songs to use in their Shorts. As we launch our beta in the US, we’ll have millions of songs (and growing), music catalogs from over 250 labels and publishers, including Universal Music Group’s labels and publishing companies, Sony Music Entertainment and Publishing, Warner Music Group and Warner Chappell Music, Believe, Merlin, 300 Entertainment, Kobalt, Beggars, CD Baby, Empire, Peer, Reservoir, OneRPM and more. As we expand Shorts, the library and number of partners will continue to grow.Stay tuned for more Shorts creation tools rolling out in the future as we expand to more countries. Delivering a seamless viewing experience across YouTubeWe know that creation is only one part of the Shorts experience. We also want to help people find Shorts to enjoy and help creators get discovered. We’ve introduced a row on the YouTube homepage especially for Shorts, have launched a new watch experience that lets you easily swipe vertically from one video to the next, and are testing adding a Shorts tab on mobile that makes it easier for you to watch Shorts with a single tap.We’re also exploring how to deepen your connection with Shorts content, creators, and artists you’re most interested in by integrating it with the YouTube you already know and love. For instance, if you hear a snippet of a song on Shorts, you can easily find the full song, watch the music video, or learn more about the artist —all on YouTube. And soon it will work both ways. Loving music from Megan Thee Stallion? Tap the create button right from the video to make your own Short with that audio, or check out how others are using it on Shorts.As more people create and watch Shorts, we expect that our systems will get even better, improving our ability to help you discover new content, trends, and creators you’ll love. Supporting mobile creators YouTube has helped an entire generation of creators turn their creativity into businesses and become the next generation media companies. Over the last three years, we’ve paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media companies.Shorts is a new way to watch and create on YouTube, so we’re taking a fresh look at what it means to monetize Shorts and reward creators for their content. We are deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators with Shorts, and are actively working on what monetization options will look like in the future.

To honor the day, YouTube has partnered with the African American Policy Forum and Professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, founder of the #SayHerName movement, to elevate the stories of women of color and their personal experiences with police brutality and racial injustice. You can watch our playlist here. We had an opportunity to speak with Professor Crenshaw about the movement and the road ahead. You coined the term ‘intersectionality’ over 30 years ago to describe the layered experiences of racial and gendered discrimination of women of color at the intersection of race and gender, as well as class and sexuality. This started as a legal term, but in recent years it has taken on increased urgency as a necessary way of challenging the constant erasure of Black women from conversations of racial and gender equity. What do you want people to understand about intersectionality? “ What I want people to understand about intersectionality is that it is a way of seeing; it’s a prism that can inform advocacy, policy, and everyday practice in a way that encourages more equitable futures.” What I want people to understand about intersectionality is that it is a way of seeing; it’s a prism that can inform advocacy, policy, and everyday practice in a way that encourages more equitable futures. It’s not some formulaic, additive, academic doctrine—it is a concept that is capacious enough to take in and understand the many overlapping social dynamics that inform how inequalities are produced and sometimes overlooked by prevailing ways of thinking about discrimination.I first theorized intersectionality in a 1989 essay after examining the ways in which Black women in the workplace were discriminated against not just as women, nor just as Black people, but as Black women. Decades later, when we at the African American Policy Forum started the #SayHerName Campaign, we drew attention to the fact that Black women’s vulnerability to state violence was not being seen as a part of traditional anti-racist and feminist frames. What we saw was that the same intersectional failure that I’d written about in 1989 was playing out on an even broader scale. That’s the power of an intersectional framework—it allows us to see how the limited and siloed approaches we’ve taken to discrimination create crevices that swallow up countless issues. To build more capacious approaches to social justice, we have to attend to people who fall between the cracks.It’s Women’s History Month, and earlier this week we celebrated International Women’s Day. How should we be thinking about an intersectional approach to women’s history in 2021 and beyond?An intersectional approach to women’s history understands that women’s history is world history. It’s Black history; it’s colonial history; it’s queer history; and it’s the history of the working class. The history of women is informed by all the ways the social and political world has been shaped. That’s because women are constitutive of every moment in human history.This history should, of course, be celebrated and uplifted. But still, after what happened at the Capitol on January 6, we must understand that there is much left to do in order to protect what’s been accomplished. The corrosive story that this country belongs to just some of us is rewriting our past, gutting equality, and reversing efforts to make “liberty and justice” a reality. “ We can’t fight for inclusion if we cannot name exclusion. It’s true of the history of women, and it’s thus true of the history of humanity.” All across the nation, efforts to ban frameworks like intersectionality, structural racism, and gender equity rob future generations of the tools they need to ensure that no one is left behind. After all, we can’t fight for inclusion if we cannot name exclusion. It’s true of the history of women, and it’s thus true of the history of humanity.Movements like #SayHerName and #MeToo have mobilized both online and offline with great success. How do you think that digital and social media have changed or influenced activism and community organizing? Like all new technologies, the internet has enhanced our capacity to communicate instantly and directly. For the #SayHerName Campaign, that’s meant that we’ve been able to circumvent the usual limitations on telling stories about Black women—stories that haven’t been reported because they fall outside of conventional narrative lines. In that sense, our very capacity to know the stories of Black women killed by police, and connect with their families, has been advanced by digital and social media. Still, as has been the case throughout history, we are collectively adjusting to the ways in which social media can be used as a tribalistic echo chamber. It’s no accident that in study after study Black women receive a disproportionate number of death threats and hateful messages online—it’s an experience that I know all too well. This hatred, injustice, and disproportionate impact are a reflection of the fact that the internet is beholden to the same structural dimensions of racism and sexism that the rest of American society is plagued by. And although the internet presents incredible possibilities for marginalized communities to come together, it still requires the same intervention and the same reckoning with histories of injustice that other facets of society do.We’re now one year on from the death of Breonna Taylor and while no one from the police force has been held accountable, there have been changes to policing procedures such as the ban on no-knock search warrants enacted by the city of Louisville. Do you feel that these measures will have a positive impact or do they fall short? “ So long as the structural dimensions of policing that insure disproportionate impact on Black people go unchallenged, all reforms are going to be piecemeal.” So long as the structural dimensions of policing that insure disproportionate impact on Black people go unchallenged, all reforms are going to be piecemeal. That’s not to say that such reforms are not incredibly important, and that they won’t save lives as they are enacted. But new rules that change some features of law enforcement, while leaving untouched the overall project of constraining and punishing Black populations, will always fall short.This means that the struggle is greater than just one reform on particularly egregious police tactics. We have to go much further, and probe much deeper, to talk about the role of police unions in insulating violent state actors from consequences, the role of prosecutors in targeting the most vulnerable, the role grand juries in parroting the same biases that have been reflected in the law for generations, and the role of our political system in reinforcing policing’s status quo and rewarding “tough on crime” narratives.Case in point, it wasn’t just the existence of a no-knock warrant that took Breonna Taylor’s life. It was the War on Drugs and its targeting of the distribution level of the drug trade rather than elites in gated communities. This focus on the most marginalized predictably and repeatedly placed people of color and low-income people at the brunt of draconian policing practices, resulting in innocent people like Breonna losing their lives. The same focus on the flaws of the downtrodden is present in the media privileging of the police story. Taken together, we have a system—and a broader social discourse—that supports an industry of life-taking. Because that industry has been the status quo in America for so long, people mistakenly think it can only be this way. That’s thinking that is being transformed by movements today. The #SayHerName Mothers Network has been focused on centering and sharing the stories of mothers affected by police brutality and police violence against their daughters. Why is it so important that we hear from these mothers? Historically, Black women, girls, and femmes have not fit the most accessible frames of anti-Black police violence. Their precarity is buried beneath myths, stereotypes, and denial. But the heartbreaking truth is that Black girls as young as 7 and women as old as 93 have been killed by the police. They’ve been shot, beaten, and tasered to death for driving while Black, having a mental health crisis while Black, being homeless while Black, and sleeping in their own beds while Black. They’ve been killed when they don’t conform to gender stereotypes, and executed when their very existence strikes fear into the hearts of police officers. Many times, they’re killed for simply being while Black. “ The #SayHerName Campaign—and #SayHerName Mothers Network in particular—breaks the national silence around the killing of Black women by the police.” The #SayHerName Campaign—and #SayHerName Mothers Network in particular—breaks the national silence around the killing of Black women by the police. The work of AAPF and the mothers of the movement is grounded in the belief that while Black women’s names are not on our tongues, their mothers don’t grieve for them any less, their children don’t miss them any less, and we should not protest their killings any less than the killings of their Black brothers. #SayHerName has no marquee women. There is no one story that rises above, no family grief that is more important than another's, and no demand for justice that rings louder than the rest. This equal footing is the glue that holds the campaign together, and entrenches the work of the #SayHerName Mothers Network. What are you optimistic about as this movement progresses? Where do you envision we are five years from now?Although optimism is often hard to find in times like this, I glean hope from the fact that our collective consciousness is now grounded in the reality that Black women have lost lives to police violence, and that these lost lives have inspired massive, collective outrage. With that outrage, we can forward legislation and advocacy that we’ve never seen before—we can marshall a truly intersectional moment, while restructuring and reimagining what’s possible for this country.Over the next five years, I hope that we’re able to equip thousands of change agents to enact a new story—an intersectional one, that demarginalizes Black women in order to build a more just society for all. You are a legal scholar, a beloved law professor, a movement leader, and the pioneer of Critical Race Theory as well as intersectionality. What made you want to fight for justice in the classroom, the courtroom, and on the streets? “ We’ve got a ways to go, but the only way to move ahead is together.” To take seriously the possibility of progress, you have to take seriously that any theory of change must be collaborative and cross-institutional. Growing up in Canton, Ohio, I knew early on that my experience as a Black girl was affected by the law, and I witnessed—as the daughter of a generation of Black folks who advocated for racial justice—the possibilities of activism. From those early days, I knew that embarking on a journey to create a more egalitarian society required speaking out and talking back to injustice. The on-the-ground activism that I saw around me was supplemented by substantive work on the history and theory of transformative change that I learned in college, law school, and over the course of my career. I’m still learning, adapting, and re-imagining. It’s a lifelong process.My orientation is to marry the often-disparate arenas of activism and academia, integrating tools and resources to promote the legal, institutional, and mass mobilizations that are necessary for true, structural change. We’ve got a ways to go, but the only way to move ahead is together."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/three-trends-are-redefining-video","date":"2021-03-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"Three trends that are redefining video","text":"The video landscape today is rapidly changing in ways that are redefining how we watch, what we watch, and why we watch—developments that impact not just viewers, but also advertisers, creators, and artists. And while some of these trends have been years in the making, the pandemic dramatically accelerated their evolution in our lives. Earlier this morning, I participated in IAB’s annual leadership meeting to talk about three trends driving digital video into the future. Streaming platforms and CTV are on the riseEven before the pandemic, streaming was quickly becoming the preferred way to enjoy content. The last year solidified this trend, with increasing numbers of people abandoning traditional linear TV. According to eMarketer, more than 106 million U.S. households are projected to watch streaming content in 2021, eclipsing pay TV. Viewers are leaving behind traditional primetime, and we’re finding at YouTube that the new primetime is personal. People want the freedom to stream anything whenever they want, whether it’s a favorite movie, a hard-to-find music performance, a premiere sports event, or even a tough workout. Viewers are also increasingly streaming content on their connected TV screens as they spend more time at home. In fact, though mobile still makes up the largest percentage of how content is consumed on the platform, our fastest growing viewing experience is on the TV screen. Last December, over 120 million people in the U.S. streamed YouTube or YouTube TV on their TV screens. And there’s another interesting viewing behavior emerging. A new generation of viewers chooses to watch YouTube primarily on the TV screen: Also in December, over a quarter of logged-in YouTube CTV viewers in the U.S. watched content almost exclusively on the TV screen.1 For advertisers, the move to streaming on TV screens brings both challenges and opportunities. Some challenges, like planning what to buy and measuring impact, aren’t exactly new. Solutions are being developed to address these issues and have already broken new ground. For example, for the first time ever this 2021/2022 upfront season in the U.S., advertisers will be able to measure their YouTube CTV campaigns with Nielsen. As for opportunities, streaming gives advertisers more places to reach those customers who have been abandoning TV for streaming platforms, including hard-to-reach viewers. And while much has been made about the complexity and fragmentation of audiences, the number of ad-supported platforms with scale is actually pretty small. According to Comscore, 82.5 percent of CTV reach in the U.S. falls on only five streaming services: Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+, but only two sell ads. 41 percent of all ad-supported streaming watch time in the U.S. happens on YouTube.2 All of this makes clear how CTV has opened a significant new chapter for video on YouTube and beyond. E-commerce is growing faster, powered by digital videoIt’s no secret that e-commerce has been growing for years, but the pandemic further fueled its jump last year. In 2020, online shopping’s share of total retail sales hit 21.3%, a 44% spike from the previous year.3 And as this shift only continues to grow, video will play an increasingly important role. One reason is that consumers want the convenience of researching and reviewing products online at home, but with the trusted guidance of an in-store experience. That’s where YouTube’s creators come in. They’ve committed considerable time and effort into building authentic connections with fans, and as a result, deliver trusted brand and product recommendations to their audience. Just look at iJustine, who vlogs about virtually all tech gear - from mobile phones to consumer drones - and gives expert reviews her fans have come to depend on. Not surprisingly, according to a study we partnered with Talkshoppe on in 2020, 70% of YouTube viewers say they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube. In my recent blog post launching this innovation series, I discussed how we’re beta testing a new integrated shopping experience that lets viewers tap into the credibility and knowledge of creators to make informed purchases directly on YouTube. Short-form content is here for the long runThe growth of short-form content on mobile has been remarkable to watch and it can be explained by two related developments: easy paths to creation and consumption. Mobile devices offer simple but powerful tools for anyone to create or watch compelling content.To give viewers the short-form content they’ve grown to love, we’ve been developing our own short-form mobile experience called “Shorts.” We began beta testing Shorts last year in India with various creation tools, including a multi-segment camera, the ability to record with music, speed controls, as well as a timer and countdown feature. Since the beginning of December, the number of Indian channels using Shorts creation tools has more than tripled. In the next few weeks, we’ll begin expanding the beta to the U.S. As these three trends lay out, it’s an exciting time for digital video. Video empowers viewers to watch content as never before; advertisers to reach customers as never before; and creators and artists to find an audience as never before. CTV, e-commerce, and short-form video will continue to play out in the years ahead, and I’m looking forward to seeing what new trends redefine the place of video in our lives.1 Exclusive defined as >=90%.2 Comscore, OTT Intelligence, Mar. 2020, U.S.3 According to one review of U.S. Department of Commerce data for 2020."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube","date":"2021-02-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"A new choice for parents of tweens and teens on YouTube","text":"This generation of tweens and teens has grown up online, and it’s where they go to learn, laugh, and connect. Every family has a different approach to how they use technology, access the internet and set digital ground rules. Over the years, we’ve made investments to protect families and kids on YouTube, such as launching a dedicated kids app, better protecting their privacy, restricting features and improving age restrictions. Today, we are announcing a new choice for parents who have decided their tweens and teens are ready to explore YouTube with a supervised account. Supervised experiences on YouTubeFrom our earliest days, YouTube has been a platform for people over 13, and we’ve always recommended that parents co-watch with their kids if they choose to watch YouTube. In 2015, we created YouTube Kids, a safer destination for kids to explore their interests while providing parental controls. But since then, we’ve heard from parents and older children that tweens and teens have different needs, which weren’t being fully met by our products. As children grow up, they have insatiable curiosity and need to gain independence and find new ways to learn, create, and belong. Over the last year, we've worked with parents and experts across the globe in areas related to child safety, child development, and digital literacy to develop a solution for parents of tweens and teens. In the coming months, we’ll launch a new experience in beta for parents to allow their children to access YouTube through a supervised Google Account. This supervised experience will come with content settings and limited features. We’ll start with an early beta for families with kids under the age of consent to test and provide feedback, as we continue to expand and improve the experience. Giving parents content options on YouTubeWe know that every parent has a different parenting style and that every child is unique and reaches different developmental stages at different times. That’s why we’ll give parents the ability to choose from 3 different content settings on YouTube. Explore: For children ready to move on from YouTube Kids and explore content on YouTube, this setting will feature a broad range of videos generally suitable for viewers ages 9+, including vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, educational content and more.Explore More: With content generally suitable for viewers ages 13+, this setting will include an even larger set of videos, and also live streams in the same categories as “Explore.”Most of YouTube: This setting will contain almost all videos on YouTube, except for age-restricted content, and it includes sensitive topics that may only be appropriate for older teens.This option was designed for parents who think their children are ready to explore the vast universe of YouTube videos. We will use a mix of user input, machine learning and human review to determine which videos are included. We know that our systems will make mistakes and will continue to evolve over time. We recommend parents continue to be involved in guiding and supporting their child’s experience on YouTube. To help parents get started, we’ve developed a guide in partnership with National PTA, Parent Zone and Be Internet Awesome. We’ll also launch an ongoing campaign that features creators discussing themes like bullying and harassment, misinformation, digital well-being and more. New features for familiesWe understand the importance of striking a balance between empowering tweens and teens to more safely gain independence, while offering parents ways to set controls. In addition to choosing the content setting, parents will be able to manage watch and search history from within their child's account settings. Parents can also use other controls offered by Google’s Family Link, including screen timers. We’ll continue adding new parental controls over time, such as blocking content. When a parent grants access to YouTube, their child’s experience will feel much like regular YouTube, but certain features will be disabled to protect younger audiences. For example, we won't serve personalized ads or ads in certain categories. At launch, we'll also disable in-app purchases, as well as creation and comments features. Since self-expression and community are integral parts of YouTube and children's development, over time we'll work with parents and experts to add some of these features through an age-appropriate and parent controlled approach. Investing in YouTube KidsWe’re building this new supervised experience for parents who think their older kids are ready to use YouTube, but we still recommend YouTube Kids for younger kids to watch independently and have a more contained viewing experience. With availability in over 80 countries, now over 35 million viewers use YouTube Kids every week. We’ll continue expanding product availability, adding new features, and offering several new parental tools, such as a highly-requested option for parents to select specific videos and channels from the main YouTube platform that they’d like their child to explore on YouTube Kids.We know that we have a long journey ahead of us as we design this experience for parents of tweens and teens. Over the long term, we hope this will provide a safer environment for older children to explore their interests, learn new skills, connect with communities that share their passions, while giving parents more ways to support their kids' online experience."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-originals-black-renaissance-jason-reynolds","date":"2021-02-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Originals","News & Events"],"title":"Q&A with Jason Reynolds of YouTube Originals’ 'Black Renaissance'","text":"On February 26, YouTube Originals, in partnership with Google Arts & Culture, will premiere “Black Renaissance,” a new special from the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund, celebrating the contributions of Black history makers who shaped the world.Black art and culture have defined the American experience.

We did a quick Q&A with executive producer and on-camera talent, Jason Reynolds, to give viewers an inside look at what inspires him: Jason Reynolds (photo credit: Dayo Kosoko) What called out to you about “Black Renaissance” and spurred you to be part of the project?Jason Reynolds: “As someone who works in storytelling, any chance I get to be a part of something that explores the vast narrative of Blackness — and in this case, specifically through the arts — is a chance that can't be passed up. My life is about celebrating us, and that's what this project is meant to do.”Which Black creatives inspire you these days? Who are you excited to see featured in “Black Renaissance”?JR: “I'm inspired by so many. Kiese Laymon, Adebunmi Gbadebo, Kendra Allen, Cheryl Dunye, Joy Oladokun, and the list goes on. Who I'm most excited about seeing in Black Renaissance has to be Anderson .Paak. I think he's the leader of his pack, and his dynamism feels both broken-in and brand new.”Being an author takes a lot of persistence and hard work, which you talk about in your BookTube episode. What keeps you persisting, despite the struggle?JR: “The work doesn't stop until all the stories have been told. And since all the stories will never be told…”What is the biggest takeaway you hope viewers get from “Black Renaissance”?JR: “That Black people have been. And will be. Period. And to be honest, I hope Black folks watch it, and smile, and snap, and do what we do when it's good to us. When it's good for us.” #YouTubeBlack Voices shines a spotlight on the unique Black talent behind the scenes of “Black Renaissance.” This project would not have been possible without Leah Harper-Lane (EIC / Executive Producer), Clover Hope (Co-Executive Producer / Wordsmith), Dave Schilling (Co-Executive Producer / Wordsmith), Pauli Lovejoy (Music Supervisor & Lead Composer), Ele Woods (Producer / Wordsmith), Courtney Neal (Producer), Chris Freeman (Associate Producer), Christopher McQueen (Associate Producer), Andrea Torres (Production Coordinator), JaMar Jones (Director for History Breaks), LaTonya Joyce (Coordinator for History Breaks), Kirby Griffin (DP for History Break), Yaffraa (Music Composer), Fatima Robinson (Producer of Dance Story Development Dance), Aaron Tucker (Asst.

And to keep their needs at the forefront of everything we do, we continuously look for new ways to support them in their drive towards creativity and success. “ In just over four years, we hosted over 45 Pop-up events reaching over 15,000 creators and artists...in over 20 cities that normally wouldn’t have access to a physical Space.” One of these efforts was the creation of YouTube Spaces. Nine years ago, we launched Spaces in major cities around the world. These physical locations across key markets provided our creators and artists with important resources, including state-of-the-art studios, events, and classes. Most importantly, they offered a place to build valuable creative connections. In 2016, we began seeing that community stretched beyond the four walls of our physical facilities, and we launched YouTube Pop-up Spaces: smaller, more nimble physical locations to bring the best programming of our Spaces temporarily to over 20 additional countries.In just over four years, we hosted over 45 Pop-up events reaching over 15,000 creators and artists, as well as NGOs and educational institutions. These were located in over 20 cities that normally wouldn’t have access to a physical Space, from Buenos Aires and Mexico City, to Madrid, Milan, Cairo, Jakarta, Taiwan, and Mumbai. And they all brought with them a unique local flavor, like our music-focused Pop-ups in Stockholm and Nashville. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we refocused our partner programming and plans even further to a completely virtual model. Over the course of 2020, we ran over a thousand online events, from introductory Shorts workshops for creators in India, to a U.S. virtual series helping creators produce great content from home, to programs like Boss & Bloom in the UK, which focused on supporting diverse female creators. All in all, in spite of closing our facilities last year, our virtual events reached over 70,000 people across 145 countries worldwide. “ This flexible new strategy will allow us to reach more regions, positively impact more new and existing creators and artists by giving them the guidance and resources they need to take their craft to the next level.” Today, our YouTube partner community continues to expand at an exponential pace, and we need to better meet the needs of our creators and artists, no matter where they might be. Moving forward, we’re doubling down on the more scalable and nimble strategy to reach more creators and artists with the tools and workshops we offer. As a result, we won't be reopening our physical YouTube Spaces locations in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rio, and Tokyo, but will instead focus on a hybrid model that combines virtual and in-person Pop-up programming.We truly believe this flexible new strategy will allow us to reach more regions, and positively impact more new and existing creators and artists by giving them the guidance and resources they need to take their craft to the next level. In 2021, we are committing to the following:Multi-week virtual development programs to invest in the growth and success of our first-ever #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund for creators and artists—recipients span the U.S., UK, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria Brazil and Australia. Ongoing investment in the NextUp program to support fast-rising creators in markets like Russia, Japan, the Philippines and Germany.Multiple live and recorded online workshops as part of the Creator Academy’s Learning Toolkits. These offerings help creators produce great content at home, explore new ways to earn money with YouTube tools, and learn best practices for livestreaming.YouTube artist and label workshops to preview the latest product developments, content strategies, and case studies.Once in-person events are allowed, we will once again bring Pop-up events and experiences to even more new communities. Programming will include trainings on new products like Shorts, and events like Music Nights.Our vision at YouTube is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. This new approach will help us deliver more than ever on this promise."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/2021-youtube-adblitz-awards","date":"2021-02-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Ads","News & Events"],"title":"The 2021 YouTube AdBlitz awards go to...","text":"The Big Game is bigger than one day, and that’s especially true for the ads.

That is, until a few months ago when he came across a tutorial on YouTube.“It inspired me to pick up the brush after many years,” Khalid says. “I also wanted to make sure I purchased my materials from my local art shop which had been suffering due to many closures and restrictions.”Khalid, a program manager who works on Google Cloud, is an avid traveler who loves exploring new places. Since that’s not possible right now, he instead decided to paint his favorite travel destination: Rio de Janeiro. In his piece, he incorporated some of the famous landmarks he saw when he visited, including the Carioca Aqueduct and the Selaron Steps. Khalid and his grandmother working on the Rio de Janeiro painting together. “Painting feels great because it allows me to take time away from screens and always being on the internet. I like to paint on really large canvases and get my family to join in too,” Khalid says. “I was really excited to be able to get my grandma involved who had never used a paintbrush before in her life! It helped us pass the time while isolating together at my family home in London.”He’s also been experimenting with abstract art, and watched YouTube tutorials to learn how to create paintings using palette knives for the first time. Palette knives are blunt tools made from thin steel blades in a range of sizes. They’re primarily used to mix or apply paint, but you can also use them in place of paintbrushes. “I’ve been able to create some unique pieces with this process,” he says. “It’s been awesome to use YouTube as a tool to quickly learn new skills from so many talented content creators.” Geometric Art - October 2020 - Acrylic on Canvas Khalid’s YouTube channel recommendations for painters:One of his favorites is Suraj Fine Arts, which Khalid says is perfect for beginners.Createful Art is great for Acrylic paintPaintings by Dusan is fantastic for Palette Knife tutorialsAlan Art - an awesome YouTuber who has great tutorials for small canvases"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/then-and-now-creating-life-day","date":"2021-02-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Originals","News & Events"],"title":"Then and now: creating 'Life in a Day'","text":"A photographer walking through Kabul, Afghanistan, looking for a good shot. A woman having a virtual date night with her husband while he serves overseas in the U.S. army. A boy named Sasha’s first shave. Three Angolan women singing as they work to produce corn flour.These seemingly disparate moments were all part of the same day in July 2010. From a Googler’s scrappy pitch to 80,000 video submissions from people around the world came \"Life in a Day.\" It was the biggest crowdsourced feature film ever made, directed by Kevin Macdonald and executive produced by Ridley Scott. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and has received over 17 million views to date on YouTube.Now, a decade later, the same team set out to create another global time capsule: this time, with a dedicated YouTube Originals team at the helm, and more than 324,000 submissions to document one of the most noteworthy years in recent history. (We’re talking, of course, about 2020.) We sat down for a conversation with YouTube’s Director of Marketing, Sara Pollack, and producer Jack Arbuthnott to reflect on making the two films.Jack: Let’s take this back to the beginning. Sara, remind me where this all started?Sara: In 2009, Tim Partridge, a former Googler, came up with the concept of a global crowdsourced documentary—at the time it was called “A Day in the Life of the World.” Shortly after, Tim joined my team, and we built out a small team and partnered with Scott Free Films, a production company out of London, to make it happen.Jack: And that’s when I got involved! The idea that Tim pitched, of having this lens on the whole world together on one day, was very winning. But we really had no idea if it was possible—technically or creatively—to make a wonderful, cohesive film made from thousands of disparate clips shot on different quality devices, with no guiding narrative. The project needed a singular vision and the ability to synthesise reality into cinema. We immediately approached Kevin Macdonald. A boy in Omsk, Russia, reading with his pet rat, Rex, on July 25, 2020. Together with his mother Mariia, who submitted the footage, he spends his days conducting science experiments and reading about outer space. Sara: YouTube was only five years old at the time, and still getting over the hump of being thought of exclusively as a platform for dogs on skateboards, silly home videos, etc. This was a big opportunity for us to show how YouTube could be used for creative storytelling, and how we could bring the world together in that pursuit. Creating a film with Ridley Scott and Kevin Macdonald, and screening it at the Sundance Film Festival, was all pretty uncharted territory.Jack: This definitely felt radical at the time. It also felt really important that everyone who was a part of the film got to be a part of that first experience. So when the 2010 film premiered at Sundance, they took a leap and let us live stream the premiere from the event in Park City, Utah, so anyone in the world could watch it together.Sara: It’s kind of ironic now that most entertainment experiences are happening virtually, and our 2020 film had its premiere in the first all-virtual Sundance. Jack, what were some of the other standout changes for you in terms of production?Jack: The change over only 10 years has been extraordinary. The industry itself has transformed entirely, and most people now see films by streaming them. But also, the way we made the film this time around was different. Crowdsourcing, reviewing, tagging and editing down the 80,000 videos from 2010 was a complete nightmare. Ten years later, with four times as many clips, working remotely, and with vastly more file formats, we were able to address every deficiency and create a really seamless system. We became entirely reliant on Google Cloud Services, as we began to realise quite how much it could do— and with such delicious scalability! We used machine learning to categorize and tag submissions, and for translation. We stored everything in the cloud. The editors could search for anything and find it instantaneously.Sara: Shout out to Google Cloud! Thank you for the support! Jack: It’s true! It really was a game changer. We also used Google technology in creating the score. In 2010, one of the composers, Matthew Herbert, asked everyone to submit a breath and a clap. This time, he used Google AI to parse every submission we received— and there are elements of the score derived from every single video. Matthew also extracted over 26,000 different dog barks, to create a kind of dog bark piano, amongst other strange feats.Sara: That will never stop being cool for me. It was also great to bring everyone back together for another project. Kevin, Ridley, Sundance—even Tim Partridge was back with us again, albeit this time as a producer working from his own creative agency. We also had the opportunity to add more in-house expertise this time around, as the 2020 film is officially a YouTube Originals film, which didn’t exist when we made the first one. The 2020 film benefited from the fresh perspective added by Susanne Daniels (Global Head of Original Content), Alex Piper (Head of Unscripted) and the entire YouTube Originals team with Nicole Emanuele leading as the development executive. Life In A Day 2010 Film Jack: And some of the contributors! It was amazing to have some of them return and show the ten year time jump. So much so, that we created an additional segment focused on them.Sara: Yes! YouTube Premium subscribers have access to bonus content including “Then and Now,” which shows contributors from the original film and where they were in 2020. It also includes some scenes that didn’t make the final cut for the second Life in a Day, but are remarkable nonetheless.Sara: There’s also this deep connection you’re able to build with the contributors in the film. It’s easy to get attached to the people, so it felt really good that we had quite a few folks from the 2010 film return for 2020. You see Taiji Aikawa, the little boy from Japan, all grown up. There’s also some sadness; Suzanne Lucas shares in the 2020 film that her son Alex, who appeared in the first film, passed away from COVID-19 last February, at only 23 years old. The 2020 film is dedicated to his memory.Jack: This year, there is definitely a different tone and range of emotions in the film. A lot has happened in the world over the last decade, and particularly over the last year. It truly felt like the perfect time to revisit this project and let people share their stories. Let’s do it again in 10 years!"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-destination-for-sports-fans-youtube-select-ctv-offering","date":"2021-02-03T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Ads","YouTube Sports","News & Events"],"title":"YouTube launches new destination for sports fans and expands its YouTube Select CTV offering","text":"The way we watch video has forever changed.

The meaning and importance of our hair, the way we dance, the rhythms we create, and the beauty of our different skin tones.How are you inspired by Black creativity that happens on YouTube?LA: Black creativity on YouTube was the thing that empowered me. I see so many people who look like me, talking about things that I need to hear, and I think that it’s really inspiring. Is there a message you would like to share with young Black people who are thinking about becoming artists?LA: No matter what you do, don’t let go of your Blackness.

This is occurring as we approach a time when Holocaust survivors and other eyewitnesses will no longer be alive. The Museum preserves these stories as a living memorial to the Holocaust, inspiring people around the world to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity. In the words of Irene Weiss, who survived Auschwitz-Birkenau but lost most of her family, “I need you to remember, because the Holocaust happened during my lifetime, not in ancient history, and the world stood by and did not help.” Irene Weiss points at a photograph that shows her shortly after she arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944 and was selected for forced labor. It is part of the main exhibition at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, where Weiss is a volunteer.

Several of those survivors will speak on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, urging us to listen and carry their stories forward to future generations. Their message will be echoed by U.S. Senators Ben Cardin of Maryland and Tim Scott of South Carolina, as well as leaders of three memorial sites in Europe. “The hope is, first of all, that we understand the history from the view of the victims ... and to try to learn ... how we should behave in the future to prevent such a crime,” said Dr. Thomas Lutz, of Germany’s Topography of Terror Foundation.Together, we can defend the truth of this history."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/blackpink-and-late-late-show-james-corden","date":"2021-01-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"BLACKPINK will be on The LATE LATE SHOW with James Corden","text":"This Wednesday at 12:37 a.m. ET or 2:37 p.m. KST, the YouTube record-breaking, international K-pop sensations, BLACKPINK, will make an appearance on CBS’ The Late Late Show With James Corden to give fans a first look of what they can expect to see and hear on their upcoming YouTube exclusive live stream concert experience, “THE SHOW.” The group will chat with Corden from the concert venue in Seoul, Korea and give fans a sneak peek performance.

As part of this ongoing commitment to supporting credible health information, we will be working with organizations including the American Public Health Association, Cleveland Clinic, The Forum at the Harvard School of Public Health, Mayo Clinic, Osmosis, Psych Hub, and the National Academy of Medicine. We’re working to make high-quality health content available for viewers around the world. Led by Dr. Garth Graham, the team will further YouTube’s efforts to bring quality content from authoritative, evidence-based sources to be front-and-center on the platform. Please meet Dr. Garth Graham, Director and Global Head of Healthcare and Public Health Partnerships at YouTube. Why did you become a doctor?Garth Graham: “Growing up, I saw, firsthand, how important health and access to health information is. My parents emigrated to the United States from Jamaica so that my mom could take a job as a nurse in Miami, and day after day she would leave for the hospital to do the selfless work of treating her patients. But she did more than just treat them -- she fostered community with them, equipped them with the information they needed to understand their diagnoses, and encouraged them with helpful ways to improve their health going forward. My admiration for the work she did and how she positively impacted people’s lives was a large part of my decision to become a doctor.” Where were you before YouTube and what led you here?GG: “Over the past 20 years, I’ve worked in a number of areas of healthcare -- as a cardiologist treating patients, as a researcher educating people about public health, and as a member of the health policy community, advocating for improved healthcare. Prior to joining YouTube, I worked as Chief Community Health Officer at CVS Health and as Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — under both the Bush and Obama Administrations. I’ve also been President of the Aetna Foundation and served as the Assistant Dean for Health Policy and Chief of Health Services Research in the Department of Medicine at the University of Florida School of Medicine. For some, coming to YouTube may seem like an outlier in my resume, but I am excited to bring together all of the facets in my experience to serve as a bridge between the clinical world and YouTube.” How do you see health education evolving through digital video? GG: “As clinicians, we’re constantly looking for ways to move patient care forward and stay current with how the world around us is changing. Don’t let the outdated pagers fool you. We’re keenly aware that people are not watching talk shows or reading newspapers the way they used to. People around the world are more mobile, consuming video online and increasingly getting their most important health information from the Internet — and more specifically, YouTube. For anyone who wants to be at the forefront of change in healthcare education, YouTube is an important part of this digital revolution.” What is your vision for health content on YouTube?GG: “My team’s mission is to empower people to live their healthiest lives through knowledge, support and inspiration. Most importantly, we want to ensure access to credible, evidence-based information from trusted sources. But with so much information out there, the question becomes: How do you know which information is credible? And how do you find sources that make the complicated medical jargon more accessible and easy-to-understand?” How do you plan to bring additional credible content to the platform?GG: “Well, the short answer is that my team is working hard to surface easy-to-understand medical information from some of the most respected organizations and clinicians in healthcare. Some of our newest collaborators include the American Public Health Association, Cleveland Clinic, Harvard School of Public Health, Mayo Clinic, Osmosis, Psych Hub, and the National Academy of Medicine. They are creating high-quality health content for viewers around the world. Healthcare professionals are also a key part of the vision for health on YouTube. Building on the success of healthcare professionals on YouTube like Kati Morton, Doctor Mike (Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, DO) and Mama Doctor Jones, we have partnered with the Association for Healthcare Social Media to provide resources to healthcare professionals who use social media. Together, we will work to educate and empower new audiences with medical information on YouTube.” How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected how public health information is shared?GG: “The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored that good communication is one of the most powerful tools in healthcare and it has never been more important to ensure valid information reaches people who need it most. Health authorities around the world have a tremendous challenge in the months ahead to continue to educate people about the new COVID-19 vaccines. But the scale and reach of platforms like YouTube, that allow for engaging, easy-to-understand information to be shared easily and efficiently, can help meet that challenge and improve community health long into the future. Since March, we’ve served over 400 billion impressions of information panels that relate to COVID-19, and our creators have conducted more than 60 interviews with leading health officials, including Fat Joe’s conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci and Roshni Mukherjee’s discussion about how to manage stress during COVID-19 with Dr. Manoj Sharma. Creator health interviews have received more than 65 million views worldwide, and we look forward to more of these conversations in the year ahead.” What’s next?GG: “As a clinician myself, I can’t tell you how exciting it is that patients will be able to arm themselves with the right information so that they can ask the right questions of their doctors and take a more active role in their own health, overall. For years, medical information has mainly existed in an “ivory tower” - accessible only to clinicians, academics, scientists, or anyone not intimidated by medical jargon in Latin. We want to change this. We want to make public health truly PUBLIC. This is the first step in that direction with many more to come. I look forward to providing you with more updates in the coming weeks and months. Until then, stay safe and stay healthy.”"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/5-things-to-look-forward-to-in-youtubes-global-new-years-eve-celebration","date":"2020-12-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Originals","News & Events"],"title":"5 things to look forward to in YouTube’s global New Year’s Eve celebration","text":"YouTube Originals will kick off the New Year with a monumental and uplifting worldwide celebration by chasing midnight around the globe with “Hello 2021,” a virtual New Year’s Eve event.

They include entrepreneurs, journalists, entertainers, teachers and a wide diversity of voices that reach a global audience through the platform. For Turkish users, YouTube is a source of information, a venue for creativity, curiosity and learning — a place to explore ideas and be entertained. At YouTube, we understand the important role our open platform plays and we will continue to make decisions to nourish and protect this ecosystem.Over the past few months, we have been thoroughly analysing Turkey’s recently amended Internet Law No. 5651, which provides new requirements for social media platforms such as appointing a local representative, complying with removal & response turnaround times and publishing semi-annual transparency reports. YouTube respects the laws and regulations in the countries where we operate, while maintaining our commitments to freedom of expression, access to information, and transparency. We have been able to find a way forward and will commence the process of appointing a local representative legal entity in compliance with the law, without compromising our values. YouTube will set up a legal entity in Turkey to serve as a local representative, providing a local point of contact for the government. This step toward compliance will not change how YouTube reviews content removal requests, nor will it change how YouTube handles or holds user data. Currently, we review government removal requests when notified through the correct legal processes and disclose these requests in our transparency report, in keeping with our stance on transparency. We will continue to evaluate these requests against the law and our own policies, maintaining the processes we have in place.We remain committed to our Turkish users, creators and business partners, and will continue to preserve the platform’s vibrance and openness."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/welcome-artist-rise-live-week","date":"2020-12-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"Welcome to Artist on the Rise LIVE Week","text":"At its core, YouTube’s Artist on The Rise program is about breaking artists, and amplifying music’s most compelling up-and-comers.

We’ve seen news organizations grow their audience. And we’ve seen people turn to YouTube for the latest election results or simply to follow an historic event with the highest voting turnout in over a century in the U.S.  Our main goal going into the election season was to make sure we’re connecting people with authoritative information, while also limiting the reach of misinformation and removing harmful content. The work here is ongoing and we wanted to provide an update. Removing content that violates our policiesOur Community Guidelines prohibit spam, scams, or other manipulated media, coordinated influence operations, and any content that seeks to incite violence. Since September, we've terminated over 8000 channels and thousands of harmful and misleading elections-related videos for violating our existing policies. Over 77% of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views. We also work to make sure that the line between what is removed and what is allowed is drawn in the right place. Our policies prohibit misleading viewers about where and how to vote. We also disallow content alleging widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of a historical U.S. Presidential election. However in some cases, that has meant allowing controversial views on the outcome or process of counting votes of a current election as election officials have worked to finalize counts. Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect. Given that, we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections. For example, we will remove videos claiming that a Presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. We will begin enforcing this policy today, and will ramp up in the weeks to come. As always, news coverage and commentary on these issues can remain on our site if there’s sufficient education, documentary, scientific or artistic context. Connecting people to authoritative informationWhile only a small portion of watch time is election-related content, YouTube continues to be an important source of election news. On average 88% of the videos in top 10 search results related to elections came from authoritative news sources (amongst the rest are things like newsy late-night shows, creator videos and commentary). And the most viewed channels and videos are from news channels like NBC and CBS. We also showed information panels linking both to Google’s election results feature, which sources election results from The Associated Press, and to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) “Rumor Control” page for debunking election integrity misinformation, alongside these and over 200,000 other election-related videos. Collectively, these information panels have been shown over 4.5 billion times. Starting today, we will update this information panel, linking to the “2020 Electoral College Results” page from the Office of the Federal Register, noting that as of December 8, states have certified Presidential election results, with Joe Biden as the President-elect. It will also continue to include a link to CISA, explaining that states certify results after ensuring ballots are properly counted and correcting irregularities and errors. Additionally, since Election Day, relevant fact check information panels, from third party fact checkers, were triggered over 200,000 times above relevant election-related search results, including for voter fraud narratives such as “Dominion voting machines” and “Michigan recount.” Now let’s look at recommendations, one of the main ways our viewers find content. Limiting the reach of borderline content and prominently surfacing authoritative information are important ways we protect people from problematic content that doesn’t violate our Community Guidelines. Over 70% of recommendations on election-related topics came from authoritative news sources and the top recommended videos and channels for election-related content were primarily authoritative news. In fact, the top 10 authoritative news channels were recommended over 14X more than the top 10 non-authoritative channels on election-related content. Despite these encouraging results, we recognize there's always more to do. For example, while problematic misinformation represents a fraction of 1% of what's watched on YouTube in the U.S., we know we can bring that number down even more. And some videos, while not recommended prominently on YouTube, continue to get high views, sometimes coming from other sites. We're continuing to consider this and other new challenges as we make ongoing improvements. We understand the need for intense scrutiny on our elections-related work. Our teams work hard to ensure we are striking a balance between allowing for a broad range of political speech and making sure our platform isn't abused to incite real-world harm or broadly spread harmful misinformation. We welcome ongoing debate and discussion and will keep engaging with experts, researchers and organizations to ensure that our policies and products are meeting that goal. And as always, we'll apply learnings from this election to our ongoing efforts to protect the integrity of elections around the world."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/seeing-believing-launching-hdr-live-streams","date":"2020-12-07T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"Seeing is believing: Launching HDR for live streams","text":"Back in 2016, we added support for HDR (high-dynamic range) videos to bring a whole new level of color to YouTube.

This year, we also hosted five YouTube Gaming charity tournaments in Mexico, the United States and Europe to benefit COVID-19 relief efforts.And while we couldn't get together in person, we were still able to share communal experiences virtually.

We’re committed to supporting the diverse creator communities on YouTube and their continued success. As our CEO, Susan Wojcicki, wrote in June, we’re examining how our policies and products are working for everyone — and specifically for the Black community — and working to close any gaps. Today, I want to share an update on that progress. While the work we're sharing today is anchored in this effort, we think these changes will ultimately benefit the entire YouTube community. Removing harmful and hateful commentsWe know that comments play a key role in helping creators connect with their community, but issues with the quality of comments is also one of the most consistent pieces of feedback we receive from creators. We have been focused on improving comments with the goal of driving healthier conversations on YouTube. Over the last few years, we launched new features to help creators engage with their community and shape the tone of conversations on their channels. We’ve heard from creators that while these changes helped them better manage comments and connect with their audience, there’s more we can do to prevent them from seeing hurtful comments in the first place. To address that, we’ll be testing a new filter in YouTube Studio for potentially inappropriate and hurtful comments that have been automatically held for review, so that creators don’t ever need to read them if they don’t want to. We’ll also be streamlining the comment moderation tools to make this process even easier for creators. To encourage respectful conversations on YouTube, we’re launching a new feature that will warn users when their comment may be offensive to others, giving them the option to reflect before posting. In addition, we’ve also invested in technology that helps our systems better detect and remove hateful comments by taking into account the topic of the video and the context of a comment. These efforts are making an impact. Since early 2019, we've increased the number of daily hate speech comment removals by 46x. And in the last quarter, of the more than 1.8 million channels we terminated for violating our policies, more than 54,000 terminations were for hate speech. This is the most hate speech terminations in a single quarter and 3x more than the previous high from Q2 2019 when we updated our hate speech policy. Continuing our commitment to support creators Our goal is to make YouTube a place where creators can thrive in the long term, and we’ve done extensive work in this area, but we've heard concerns across various communities about their ability to grow their channels. We want to ensure our systems do not reflect unintentional bias and the existing process is currently limited because we only have information about content, not identifying information about the creators themselves.To better evaluate a concern from a specific creator community (e.g., concerns that our monetization systems are working differently for different creators) we need to have data about which videos come from which communities. Today, we can identify what a video is about but this does not take into account who the creator is or how they identify. For example, our systems can evaluate how videos about Black Lives Matters are performing against other content on YouTube regardless of the creator, but we’re currently not able to evaluate growth for Black beauty creators, LGBTQ+ talk show hosts, female vloggers or any other community. Today, we’re announcing a new effort to help us more proactively identify potential gaps in our systems that might impact a creator’s opportunity to reach their full potential. Starting in 2021, YouTube will ask creators on a voluntary basis to provide us with their gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity. We’ll then look closely at how content from different communities is treated in our search and discovery and monetization systems. We’ll also be looking for possible patterns of hate, harassment, and discrimination that may affect some communities more than others. This survey will be an additional way for creators to participate in initiatives that YouTube hosts, like #YouTubeBlack creator gatherings and FanFest, if they’re interested.Identity is something that is inherently personal and sharing this information should always be optional. Our creators’ privacy and ability to provide consent for how their information is used is critical. In the survey, we will explain how information will be used and how the creator controls their information. For example, the information gathered will not be used for advertising purposes, and creators will have the ability to opt-out and delete their information entirely at any time. YouTube is consulting with creators as we develop our survey, which will launch initially in the US in early 2021, and we’ll continue this project with the guidance of civil and human rights experts. If we find any issues in our systems that impact specific communities, we’re committed to working to fix them. And we’ll continue to share our progress on these efforts with you.The steps we’re announcing today are part of our ongoing work to ensure that YouTube continues to be a platform where creators of all backgrounds can thrive. We appreciate the partnership of the Black, LGBTQ+ and Latinx creator communities who have consulted with us in these efforts.

Not only have they been able to generate excitement in advance of a video debut, but they’ve also enabled fans to virtually gather, engage, and enjoy a shared experience together. In fact, since March 1, 2020, we've seen over 85% growth in daily Premieres from over 8 million channels. And over 80% of these channels had never before used Premieres.We want to continue enabling these real-time, communal experiences now more than ever. That’s why we’re launching three new features to help creators, artists, and publishers deliver an even more interactive experience with Premieres: Live Redirect, Trailers, and Countdown Themes. BTS (방탄소년단) 'Dynamite' Countdown Live Live RedirectLive Redirect allows you to host a live stream as a pre-show in advance of a Premiere. After the live stream ends, the live audience is seamlessly directed to the upcoming Premiere right before it starts.From We Are One Film Festival and New York Comic-Con, to BTS, Cardi B, and Justin Bieber, we’ve been testing this feature over the last few months and have been amazed with how it’s brought the community together. Just like a pre-party or a red carpet, we’ve seen partners use Live Redirect to engage with their audience live and create excitement and anticipation just before the main event. TrailersTrailers allow you to upload a pre-recorded hype video that will be played on the watch page in advance of the Premiere. With the option to range from 15 seconds to 3 minutes in duration, Trailers help create an even more compelling experience and encourage viewers to set a reminder to tune into the Premiere. Countdown ThemesAt the beginning of every Premiere, a countdown video is played to build excitement as fans tune in. We heard you want the ability to select a custom countdown video that matches their content though. That’s why we’re launching Countdown Themes, which will allow you to select a custom countdown for their Premiere across a range of themes, vibes, and moods. Whether you’re looking for something calm, playful, dramatic, or sporty, with the new countdown themes we’ve got you covered. Live Redirect and Trailers will begin rolling out to eligible creators starting today, and Countdown Themes will be available in the coming months.

Since the song was released in 2019, tens of thousands of Billie Eilish fans from across the globe have uploaded their own versions of “Bad Guy” to YouTube. The covers span nearly every genre, language, and country — ranging from professional to amateur — and from ridiculous to sublime. These covers reveal the very best of the YouTube creator community’s breadth and diversity, and shine a light on Billie’s passionate fans. To celebrate one of the most-covered songs on YouTube and the billion views milestone, YouTube and Google Creative Lab have built an infinite music video, \"Infinite Bad Guy.\" This unique AI experiment uses machine learning to bring thousands of covers together, seamlessly aligning them in endless combinations, creating a music video that’s different every time you watch it. Bringing a global fan base togetherInfinite Bad Guy brings together music fans and creators from around the world, and celebrates the global reach and impact of music on YouTube. From French autoharpists to Japanese rubber chickens, each of the 15,000 “Bad Guy'' covers couldn’t be more different. With approximately 10.5 million seconds (and counting) of Billie fan love, every play creates a never-before-seen and can-never-be-seen-again combination of videos performed by her talented fans from around the world. Mathematically this means 1.46 x 10^100 years of video combinations. Two people wouldn’t see the same sequence twice, from now through the end of the universe.To create this experience, Google Creative Lab had to perfectly align the audio from thousands of videos with different tempos, instruments, keys, and styles. Conventional algorithms couldn’t do the trick alone, so we turned to machine learning. For videos that deviated from the original track — like acoustic or a cappella versions — we built a neural network that could predict matches between covers and the original. With this data, we were able to line up all kinds of different covers, and switch seamlessly between them.To navigate through all of these covers, we used the Google Knowledge Graph to find patterns — identifying the different musical styles, instruments, props, and more — that make up the key moments of each video. This allows fans to explore covers that sound or look alike, or sample a little bit of everything. In combining all of these elements and more, Infinite Bad Guy was brought to life. How to play 'Infinite Bad Guy' Fans can experience Infinite Bad Guy at billie.withyoutube.com. It starts with Billie Eilish’s original music video. Within seconds, you can start exploring covers. Use the scrolling hashtags to discover different instruments, genres and more. Or just hit the autoplay button, sit back, and go for a journey through randomly selected, awe-inspiring covers. Hit pause to see all the videos you’ve watched and get stats about your unique viewing experience. You can click through to any creator’s YouTube channel and support them by hitting subscribe. Without skipping a beat, the song starts all over again with another unique mix of videos. Celebrating Billie Eilish and music fans across the globe This year alone, Billie Eilish has earned over 4 billion global views on her Official YouTube Channel, which has amassed over 35 million subscribers, making her amongst the top 15 most-subscribed artists on the platform. “Bad Guy,” her first video to reach 1 billion views, has also appeared on over 50 of YouTube’s Top Songs Charts around the world.Please join us in celebrating Billie Eilish’s billion-views milestone and thanking the thousands of music fans who made it possible, by playing \"Infinite Bad Guy\" now. This one-of-a-kind experiment will allow you to see and hear what Billie and 15,000 (and counting) creators from across the globe can make together, only on YouTube."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/updates-to-youtubes-terms-of-service","date":"2020-11-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube News","News & Events"],"title":"Updates to YouTube’s Terms of Service","text":"We periodically update our Terms of Service to make sure they are clear, easy to understand and meet the needs of our partners, advertisers and viewers. Starting today, we’re rolling out an updated Terms of Service in the United States. These new terms will be effective in countries outside of the United States in mid-year 2021. Please read through the updated terms carefully, they include the following changes.First, our Terms of Service already expressly state that you are not allowed to “collect or harvest any information that might identify a person (for example, usernames), unless permitted by that person.” This has always included facial recognition data, and with today’s updated Terms of Service, we are making that explicitly clear.Second, ads can now appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), and we will begin gradually placing ads on brand safe videos. This is part of our ongoing investments in new solutions, like Home Feed ads, that help advertisers responsibly tap into the full scale of YouTube to connect with their audiences and grow their businesses. Advertisers will continue to have full access to our brand suitability controls. Over the past three years, we improved our ability to identify appropriate placements for advertisers, in part by working closely with our advertising partners and industry organizations. Because these channels are not in YPP, there is no creator revenue share, but creators can still apply to YPP once they hit the eligibility criteria, which remains the same.Finally, for U.S. creators in YPP, our updated Terms state that any revenue payments from YouTube will now be treated as royalties from a U.S. tax perspective, and that Google will withhold taxes from these payments if it is required by law. U.S. creators will generally be unaffected by these withholding taxes as long as they provide valid tax documentation in Adsense. For creators outside of the U.S., we will provide more details in 2021 as the terms become available in their countries.You can view the previous Terms of Service and how it compares with this update in our help forum."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-music-brings-personalization-your-everyday-moods-and-moments","date":"2020-11-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"YouTube Music brings personalization to your everyday moods and moments","text":"Whether it’s pushing you through the last five minutes of your workout or helping you unwind after a stressful day, music breathes life into your daily routine.

Every year, YouTube FanFest takes YouTube’s biggest stars from screens to live stages all over the world. Thousands of fans join their favorite creators and artists in events across different countries that showcase the diversity, creativity, and YouTube communities. This year, to keep everyone safe during COVID-19, FanFest went virtual for the first time, ever. Featuring over 150 talented creators and artists from across Asia-Pacific, alongside some of the top global artists and YouTube stars such as Alex Wassabi, Matt Steffanina, Merrell Twins, Mike Chen, HRVY, and ITZY, the multi-hour live stream was a showcase of creativity and positivity across the region. For the first time ever, creators from nine different countries in Asia-Pacific joined a night filled with jaw-dropping performances, special collaborations, and lots of fun. While a live stream allowed fans to enjoy the show from the comfort of their homes, it also presented multiple challenges. A unique part of FanFest has been the in-person engagement between fans and creators, but due to the show being completely virtual, it was hard to capture that energy and make fans feel like they were truly part of a show. We decided to experiment with a special element and created YouTube FanFest Dance Movement. In the weeks leading up to YTFF 2020, we invited fans to film themselves dancing along with Matt Steffanina through a custom web experience. There were three dances to choose from, with each fan able to download their unique dance video, remixed alongside Matt on a virtual stage. To achieve this, we used an AI technique called body segmentation that cropped the fan out of their environment, and placed them into the virtual environment alongside Matt. This required some creative design solutions to allow for variations in device performance, lighting and recording quality. The sticker-style art direction gave us a consistent look and feel that allowed for imperfect capture and cropping. Finally, during the live stream, we augmented Matt’s performance on the virtual stage with a selection of the best fan-submitted videos, putting the fans directly into the show (with their consent). With millions of people tuning in from around the world, this year’s YouTube FanFest helped bring fans together to celebrate, interacting with their favourite creators and showcasing what’s possible when we all come together to do something amazing - at a time when that’s never felt so important."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-approach-to-election-day-on-youtube","date":"2020-10-26T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Civics","News & Events"],"title":"Our approach to Election Day on YouTube","text":"We are one week away from Election Day in the United States. This election season, you’ve come to YouTube for timely news and information, whether it’s to hear directly from the candidates running for office who use YouTube or to watch live coverage of key election moments from major news providers.Over the last few years, we’ve significantly increased our investments in the systems and processes that enable us to effectively remove violative videos, raise up authoritative content and reduce the spread of borderline content. Throughout this year, we’ve shared updates on how these efforts allow us to make YouTube a more reliable source for election-related news and information—for example, our information panels for federal and presidential candidates or voting by mail—as well as offering an open platform for healthy political discourse. Here is a look at how we’re applying this framework to Election Day.Our Community Guidelines do not allow misleading claims about voting or content that encourages interference in the democratic process. In addition, we have established policies prohibiting hate speech, harassment, deceptive practices and incitement to violence. For example: under our violent or graphic content policy, we remove content inciting others to commit violent acts against individuals or a group of people at polling places; and under our voter suppression policy, we remove content falsely claiming that mail-in ballots have been manipulated to change the results of an election. We consistently enforce our policies regardless of political viewpoints or who expresses those viewpoints. Content providing sufficient educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context is allowed on YouTube.The removal of violative content is just one of the ways we protect the YouTube community. Fast-moving events, like elections, may produce unverified claims, which can then lead to uncertainty. Providing viewers with accurate information is critical in moments like this, which is why we work to raise up authoritative election-related information and reduce the spread of harmful election-related misinformation in the following ways: Our suite of information panels provide additional context directly under videos and in search results, so you can make your own informed decisions. For example, earlier this year, we expanded our fact check information panels to the U.S. Beginning on Election Day, we’ll prominently surface a new election results information panel at the top of search results for a broad range of queries related to the election and under videos that discuss the election. This information panel will note that election results may not be final and link to Google’s election results feature, which will enable you to track election results in real time. As in previous years and for this year’s primaries, Google will be working with The Associated Press to provide authoritative election results.To help you learn more about participating in the democratic process, we’ll continue to promote links to timely, relevant information towards the top of your YouTube homepage. Leading up to Election Day, you’ll be able to find a link to Google’s how to vote feature and on Election Day itself, a link to Google’s where to vote feature. Then, as polls close, you’ll see a shelf of live streams of election night coverage from authoritative news partners so that, like in previous elections, you can come to YouTube throughout the evening to watch election night unfold.Finally, we’ll continue to elevate authoritative sources, including news publishers like CNN and Fox News, for election-related news and information queries in search results and “watch next” panels. And our recommendations systems will also keep limiting the spread of harmful election-related misinformation and borderline content. Our teams have been working around the clock to make sure we have the systems and policies in place to prevent the abuse of our systems and provide access to authoritative information this election season. We remain vigilant, and are committed to maintaining the important balance of openness and responsibility, on Election Day and beyond."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/tips-and-tricks-watching-your-favorite-videos","date":"2020-10-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"5 tips and tricks for watching your favorite videos on YouTube","text":"With a global community of two billion people on YouTube, we’re always looking for ways to make it easier to watch and interact with your favorite videos.

Today, we’re extending this feature to include a new list view that you can find by tapping or clicking the chapter title in the player. You’ll be able to see a complete list of all chapters included in the video you’re watching, each with a preview thumbnail of what you’ll find in that chapter. Save time by quickly jumping to the part you’re interested in! 2. A more streamlined player pageTo make captions more accessible, we’ve moved the button to a more prominent location, directly on the video player on phones. We also have moved the autoplay toggle to make it easier to turn on or off while you’re watching. (We’ll be testing this on Desktop soon, too.) You’ll also notice small improvements to the player, like re-arranged buttons that simplify its look and snappier controls that make any action you take even faster. 3. Use gestures to make YouTube more efficient and work for youPeople love being able to double tap to the left or right of a video to fast forward or rewind 10 seconds. Today, we’re making it easier to enter and exit full screen mode - simply swipe up to enter full screen and down to exit. And if you'd rather see how much time is counting down vs. the time that's elapsed in a video, now you can simply tap the timestamp to switch back and forth. 4. New suggested actions enhance experience We’re starting to roll out suggested actions, which prompt you to rotate your phone or play a video in VR when we think you can have a better experience. We plan to introduce more suggested actions in the future, too! 5. Go to bed with Bedtime Reminders We’ve recently introduced bedtime reminders, a new digital wellbeing tool that lets you set reminders at specific times to stop watching videos and go to bed, which joins our suite of features to help you manage your time on YouTube.

To address this kind of content effectively, it’s critical that our teams continually review and update our policies and systems to reflect the frequent changes. Today, we are taking another step in our efforts to curb hate and harassment by removing more conspiracy theory content used to justify real-world violence. This builds on our work over the last several years to strengthen and evolve our policies and enforcement — work that has been organized around four pillars: removing violative content, reducing the spread of harmful misinformation, raising authoritative voices, and rewarding trusted creators. “ In fact, when we looked at QAnon content, we saw the number of views that come from non-subscribed recommendations to prominent Q-related channels dropped by over 80% since January 2019.” Nearly two years ago, we took a major step to limit the reach of harmful misinformation by updating our recommendations system. This resulted in a 70% drop in views coming from our search and discovery systems. In fact, when we looked at QAnon content, we saw the number of views that come from non-subscribed recommendations to prominent Q-related channels dropped by over 80% since January 2019.Additionally, we’ve removed tens of thousands of QAnon-videos and terminated hundreds of channels under our existing policies, particularly those that explicitly threaten violence or deny the existence of major violent events. All of this work has been pivotal in curbing the reach of harmful conspiracies, but there’s even more we can do to address certain conspiracy theories that are used to justify real-world violence, like QAnon.Today we're further expanding both our hate and harassment policies to prohibit content that targets an individual or group with conspiracy theories that have been used to justify real-world violence. One example would be content that threatens or harasses someone by suggesting they are complicit in one of these harmful conspiracies, such as QAnon or Pizzagate. As always, context matters, so news coverage on these issues or content discussing them without targeting individuals or protected groups may stay up. We will begin enforcing this updated policy today, and will ramp up in the weeks to come. Due to the evolving nature and shifting tactics of groups promoting these conspiracy theories, we’ll continue to adapt our policies to stay current and remain committed to taking the steps needed to live up to this responsibility."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-fantasy-view-youtube-tv","date":"2020-10-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube TV","News & Events"],"title":"Introducing Fantasy View on YouTube TV, a new way to track your fantasy football team","text":"From the ability to rewatch key plays and catch up to a game live, hide spoilers from your favorite team, or check out real time stats from the game you’re watching, the YouTube TV team is always working to design and build innovative features that are changing how our members watch live TV. Today, we’re excited to be expanding this suite of interactive features with the introduction of Fantasy View. With Fantasy View, you can link your NFL.com fantasy account to YouTube TV, so you can effortlessly check how you’re stacking up in your fantasy league while you’re watching the games live. We’re bringing you behind-the-scenes with our design team to see how Fantasy View came to life, from talking with sports fans themselves and our first sketches, to the YouTube TV fantasy experience that launches today on Android and iOS. Here was our game plan: With Fantasy View, you can quickly check your team’s current score, or dive deeper with more stats from individual players and from around the league. Pre-game analysis: Learning from the people who know sports bestBefore even sketching initial ideas on paper, last year, we met with sports fans for some serious inspiration on their own turf: their living rooms. We wanted to see how our members watch live sports from the comfort of their own homes and saw that they’re often multitasking - checking player stats, following scores from around the league, rewinding to rewatch an awesome play, and tracking their fantasy team’s performance. It became clear early on that fantasy sports wasn’t just a niche hobby, but a different way to engage with live sports:Fantasy players are information hungry. They sought the most current stats and player info to stay up-to-date on their team’s performance, often keeping their phones nearby while they watched so they could constantly check for updates and get notifications about their favorite teams and players.They’re looking for more ways to engage with sports. Playing in a fantasy league often deepened fans’ involvement in the season and made watching sports more enjoyable.Participating in fantasy leagues is an easy way to connect with people. Many fantasy players we talked to said it helped them feel closer to their friends, family, and co-workers. Here, we mapped out all the information you can find on fantasy apps. Kicking off: Identifying opportunities early on and brainstorming our design principlesWith these foundational research insights in mind, our team of designers got right into the action and built their own leagues on popular fantasy apps. We analyzed the entire journey for a fantasy player, from setting up a team, managing it week-to-week, and watching games live. Once we mapped out that information, we grouped the most relevant and frequently checked stats to highlight during games. We identified opportunities to enhance the overall fantasy experience by improving the hierarchy of data, while making sure our experience felt familiar enough that fantasy players could easily jump right in, with the ability to quickly scan player performance plus get an overview of your matchup and others around your league. From here, we started to map out and rank all the key information that fantasy players needed to understand their performance.Based on this, we decided on some key design principles for the feature: be flexible, informative and effortless. Before moving to digital tools, designers sketched ideas on paper. Here’s an early iteration of preliminary explorations of Fantasy View. Drawing up the plays: Sketching out our initial design concepts and building the productOnce we settled on our design principles, it was time to sketch out our design directions. We explored different ways fantasy players could access information, ranging from a team-focused view, game-focused view or a live feed of mixed content. We wanted to present information in a more dynamic manner so you could access stats and info that were relevant to the game - similar to our Key Plays or Stats Views. We didn’t want YouTube TV to replace the fantasy apps that people relied on and enjoyed, but instead augment and deliver a more integrated viewing experience while they watched football. Scoring the touchdown: Bringing Fantasy View to your phones for game day We took those first design directions, plus the initial insights from our user research that fantasy brings more enjoyment to sports, to hone in on some key features and finally bring the experience to life. When you explore Fantasy View during a live game, which is available on Android and iOS devices to start, you’ll see:A live feed of the current scores in your matchup plus your projected total points, A quick look at players on your team - and your opponent’s - that are playing in the game you’re currently watching so you can see how a recent play may have impacted your score immediately,A comprehensive view of how your entire team is performing in your matchup overall,And an overview of all of the matchups in your league. Football fans, we can’t wait for you to try out Fantasy View for this weekend’s games, starting at 1 p.m. ET Sunday on CBS and FOX.

And we’ve all been finding our own ways to cope.But despite the uncertainty, something profound has been happening on YouTube. People are coming together to support each other, and creators are doing what they do best: showing up for their communities. Whether it’s pausing to check in, celebrate a moment of joy, reflect on ways to find calm, or simply express vulnerability, creators are sharing their expertise, stories, passions, and a little bit more of themselves. And these simple acts are making a difference.On World Mental Health Day — observed every year on October 10 to raise awareness of and mobilize efforts toward mental health around the world — we want to celebrate creators and the community they foster on YouTube. Thank you to the licensed mental health professionals on the platform for sharing your expert knowledge and resources with us. And thank you to the many other creators — from yoga instructors to musicians, from gardeners to gamers — for providing emotional support and a sense of connection just by opening up and talking about what you’re going through. You are all helping us take better care of ourselves and each other. Mental health exists on a spectrum from illness to wellness and, as such, impacts every single one of us. If you’re looking for ways to take care of yourself or a loved one but don’t know where to start, below are a few creators to explore.

I pass by it all the time. It’s on Bleecker Street. I see its closed doors and think about how this pandemic robbed us of live music, crowded spaces, and people coming together to hear a song that could only be played exactly that way, in exactly that space, at exactly that moment in time. Independent concert venues, like (le) poisson rouge, are hanging by a thin thread of hope. They are the heart and soul of the music industry, and we need to do our part to help save them. So before it’s too late for some of them, YouTube Music is partnering with the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA) to host a three-day virtual music festival called the Save Our Stages Festival (#SOSFEST).

For me, as a kid growing up in the Bronx in the 80s, I had a passion for technology and storytelling. Computers were the new kid on the block. And my family, like so many others, couldn’t afford the Commodore 64, but somehow my mom made a way to buy that computer for me, and my life was forever changed because of it. My story isn’t unique, though. Being given access to resources – whether they are physical or even financial tools – can be a game changer for an individual or an entire community. Back in June, we announced a $100 million fund to center and amplify Black voices and perspectives on YouTube, alongside a commitment to doing better as a platform to protect Black creators, artists and users. Since then, we’ve been doing a lot of work behind-the-scenes to bring these commitments to life because we believe when we center Black and other diverse voices, we reflect back the power of our global community.  The fund – now officially named the “#YouTubeBlack Voices Fund” – will invest with an intention: to present fresh narratives that emphasize the intellectual power, authenticity, dignity and joy of Black voices, as well as to educate audiences about racial justice. Over the next three years, this global fund will be used to acquire and produce YouTube Originals programming, focused on Black experiences around the world, and to directly support Black creators and artists so that they can thrive on YouTube. Today, we are excited to announce five YouTube Originals from the fund, including a documentary series from Patrisse Cullors, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter; an HBCU Homecoming special; a sequel to the recently launched “Bear Witness, Take Action;” a family series to encourage open communication about real world issues; and a new series that tackles public health: Here are the new and returning YouTube Originals from the fund:ResistSeries Premieres on October 20This 12 episode documentary series follows the grassroots work of multicultural/intersectional organizations fighting the Los Angeles county’s $3.5 billion jail expansion plan in 2018 and examines the issues of cash bail, unlawful arrest, over-policing of Black and brown neighborhoods, and mass incarceration. The series is an emotional look into the motivations and daily struggles of the movement workers on the ground, featuring incredibly inspiring stories from Patrisse Cullors (co-founder of Black Lives Matter), members of JusticeLA including Jayda Rasberry of Dignity and Power Now, Helen Jones of Dignity and Power Now and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, Bamby Salcedo of TransLatina Coalition, and Johnathan Perez of Immigrant Youth Coalition. The docuseries is produced by Blackpills and Pulse Films. Executive Producers are Patrisse Cullors, Dream Hampton, Mervyn Marcano, Thomas Benski, Marisa Clifford, Robin Frank, Tani Ikeda, Kai Bowe, Davey Spens, Clara Levy and Philipe Haim.

In addition to the livestream, “Bear Witness, Take Action” Part Two will feature unique voices from the Black community producing short form content to share their perspectives and experiences on racial inequity, which will live on YouTube. Viewers will be encouraged to donate to racial justice initiatives directly on the YouTube livestream. The special is produced by the SpringHill Company, Fly On The Wall Entertainment, and Byron Phillips.

Now, we’re working to give these awesome creators and artists the resources to match.” Separately, we also have a number of YouTube Originals that were developed prior to the launch of the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund, but which also center on global Black experiences and address racial justice, including: Together We Rise (streaming now on GRM Daily’s YouTube Channel ), Trapped: Cash Bail in America (premieres October 12; Watch official trailer here), a special episode of BookTube featuring Jason Reynolds (premieres October 22), The Outsiders (premieres February 2021), Glad You Asked Season 2 (premieres February 2021), and new episodes of the award-winning Kids & Family series Lockdown (new episodes premiere November 19). The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund is only part of the work currently underway to ensure that YouTube is a place where Black artists, creators and users can share their stories and be protected. Along with our commitment to amplify marginalized voices on the content side, we are also investing in product and policy changes that will continue to advance YouTube’s mission of giving everyone a voice and showing them the world. It is only when we take a stand against those who would try to bully, harass, silence and intimidate others that we truly move closer to achieving this mission. Our new efforts include ramping up enforcement and terminating more accounts that repeatedly post hateful comments, and we are in the process of rolling out product changes to make creator moderation tools more streamlined. Our YouTube Black community is filled with so many passionate, talented, brilliant, and driven creatives. Now, we’re working to give these awesome creators and artists the resources to match. As always, there is more work to be done, but our teams across the company care deeply about this work and making sure we get it right.

But despite that uncertainty, millions of you have taken to YouTube over the last few months to remind us all that, together, we can find our way through.  We started the #WithMe campaign in the early days of Covid-19, to encourage folks to do things at home, together. Our first video launched in April, ‘Get by together’ came a few weeks after that, followed quickly by ‘#GraduateWithMe.’  In our latest chapter, “Find a way #WithMe,” we take a look at all the uniquely creative ways we are getting through 2020— not just as consumers of video, but as human beings trying to find a way together. From learning new skills to meet new challenges...(DIY face mask sewing tutorials have been viewed over 1 billion times since March 15*)…to finding new ways of teaching and learning...(In January and February 2020, just over 300 videos were uploaded to YouTube with \"remote teaching\" or \"distance learning\" in the title. In March 2020, alone, that number was over 23,000.*)...together we’ve found new ways to laugh...  (Tiny face makeup challenge videos have gained over 9 million views.)…and shared creative strategies to help us cope through these times. (Average daily views of videos related to guided meditation increased over 40% after March 15.*)This #WithMe chapter, based on trending content on YouTube over the past six months, recognises all the unique and creative ways you’re finding a way on YouTube. *Source: Views of videos related to DIY, Tutorial, and How-To with \"face mask\" [Global views, 3/15/20 - 9/20/20]*Source: Views and uploads of videos with “remote teaching” or “distance learning” in the title.

Here is an overview of our efforts.YouTube’s Community Guidelines protect the community from harmful content and we enforce these policies consistently, regardless of who expresses it. Our policies prohibit claims that mislead voters on how to vote or encourage interference in the democratic process. Additionally, we demonetize content with claims that could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process. Alongside the consistent enforcement of our policies, we’re continuing to raise up authoritative voices and reduce harmful misinformation. One of the ways we do this is through our information panels, which provide relevant context alongside content. For example, in 2018, we started to show information panels linking to third-party sources around a small number of well-established topics that are subject to misinformation, such as the moon landing or COVID-19. We’re expanding this list of topics to include voting by mail. This means that under videos that discuss voting by mail, you’ll see an information panel directing you to authoritative information from the Bipartisan Policy Center, a bipartisan think tank. To further connect you with timely, authoritative voting information, searches for 2020 presidential or federal Congressional candidates on YouTube will now show an information panel with information about that candidate above search results. We’re also providing two additional information panels on voter registration and how to vote, in English and Spanish:When you search for specific queries related to voter registration on YouTube, we’ll surface an information panel at the top of the page that directs you to Google’s “how to register to vote” feature. We know election deadlines and requirements vary by state, so no matter where you live, you can use the tool to find information about voter registration in your state—including deadlines, registration options, and an easy way to check the status of your registration.When you search for specific queries on how to vote, we’ll show an information panel that directs you to Google’s “how to vote” feature. This tool provides authoritative information about how you can vote in your state—such as ID requirements, registration and voting deadlines, and guidance for different means of voting, like in person or mail. Google works with non-partisan, third-party data partners, such as Democracy Works, who aggregate official data directly from state and county election administrators, and link to your state government’s official website for more information. Additionally, for key moments leading up to November 3 — including Election Day itself — we’ll provide you with timely reminders across YouTube and our social handles on how to register, how to vote and where to vote. We’ll also share information from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission about volunteering at the polls, so you can learn more about how to get involved this election season. And as in the past, you’ll be able to easily access live coverage from authoritative sources during key election-related events, such as the debates, election night and inauguration.In the coming weeks, we’ll also launch two new YouTube Originals to bring you helpful election-related information through innovative and creative ways. “YouChoose 2020” is an interactive voting special that takes you through the key steps in the voting process using the YouTube meme of your choosing — from a cooking tutorial that compares voting to following a recipe, to an auto repair video that breaks down the ‘nuts and bolts’ of voting. “Kid Correspondent” is a four-part election special on YouTube and YouTube Kids that helps parents and families better understand and talk about civic engagement and the democratic process, such as how to use a decision tree to make tough decisions. As we approach November 3, we’re working hard to make YouTube a more reliable source for news and information, as well as an open platform for healthy political discourse. We’ll continue to keep you updated on our efforts to support the 2020 U.S. election and others around the world."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/using-technology-more-consistently-apply-age-restrictions","date":"2020-09-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Policy","News & Events"],"title":"Using technology to more consistently apply age restrictions","text":"Over the last several years, we’ve taken important steps to make YouTube a safer place for families, like launching the standalone YouTube Kids app for users under the age of 13. Today, we’re announcing a continuation of these efforts to live up to our regulatory obligations around the world and to provide age-appropriate experiences when people come to YouTube. We recognize that users and creators are generally the best judge of who should see their content, so we empower them with tools to manage access. Not only can they use privacy settings to make sure they are sharing videos with just friends and family or small groups, but we also encourage them to age-restrict their own content when appropriate. When content is age-restricted, users coming to YouTube must be signed-in and their account age must be 18 or older in order to view the video. If they aren’t, they see a warning and are redirected to find other content that is age-appropriate. Our Community Guidelines include guidance to uploaders about when content should be age-restricted. Today, our Trust & Safety team applies age-restrictions when, in the course of reviewing content, they encounter a video that isn't appropriate for viewers under 18. Going forward, we will build on our approach of using machine learning to detect content for review, by developing and adapting our technology to help us automatically apply age-restrictions. Uploaders can appeal the decision if they believe it was incorrectly applied. For creators in the YouTube Partner Program, we expect these automated age-restrictions to have little to no impact on revenue, as most of these videos also violate our advertiser-friendly guidelines and therefore have limited or no ads. To make sure the experience is consistent, viewers attempting to access age-restricted videos on most third-party websites will be redirected to YouTube where they must sign-in and be over 18 to view it. This will help ensure that, no matter where a video is discovered, it will only be viewable by the appropriate audience.Because our use of technology will result in more videos being age-restricted, our policy team took this opportunity to revisit where we draw the line for age-restricted content. After consulting with experts and comparing ourselves against other global content rating frameworks, only minor adjustments were necessary. Our policy pages have been updated to reflect these changes. All the changes outlined above will roll out over the coming months. Expanding Age-verification in EuropeIn line with upcoming regulations, like the European Union’s Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD), we will also be introducing a new age verification step over the next few months. As part of this process some European users may be asked to provide additional proof of age when attempting to watch mature content. If our systems are unable to establish that a viewer is above the age of 18, we will request that they provide a valid ID or credit card to verify their age. We’ve built our age-verification process in keeping with Google’s Privacy and Security Principles. We understand that many are turning to YouTube at this time to find content that is both educational and entertaining. We will continue to update our products and our policies with features that make sure when they do, they find content that is age-appropriate."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts","date":"2020-09-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News & Events"],"title":"Building YouTube Shorts, a new way to watch & create on YouTube","text":"YouTube has always been a place to be entertained — from your favorite dance trends, like Evolution of Dance, Roller Skate Dances, or the Jerusalema Challenge — to highly replayable short videos, like Charlie Bit My Finger, Good morning yall or even Lockdown Trick Shots. Over the years, YouTube has enabled an entire generation of creators who have shared their voice and found an audience of more than two billion people. User-generated short videos were born on YouTube starting with our first upload, a short 18-second video called “Me at the zoo.” As technology advances, creators and artists can now take advantage of the incredible power of smartphones to easily create and publish high-quality content wherever they are in the world. And people can be entertained and informed by bite-sized content in the spare minutes of the day.That’s why we’re excited to announce that we are building YouTube Shorts, a new short-form video experience right on YouTube for creators and artists who want to shoot short, catchy videos using nothing but their mobile phones.Over the next few days in India, we’re launching an early beta of Shorts with a handful of new creation tools to test this out. This is an early version of the product, but we're releasing it now to bring you — our global community of users, creators and artists — on our journey with us as we build and improve Shorts. We’ll continue to add more features and expand to more countries in the coming months as we learn from you and listen to your feedback. Here are more details on what to expect. What is Shorts?Shorts is a new way to express yourself in 15 seconds or less, and our team is focused on building its foundation across three main areas:Create: Creation is at the core of short-form video, and we want to make it easy and fun to create Shorts. We’re starting to test just a few new tools for creators and artists with our early beta in India: A multi-segment camera to string multiple video clips together,The option to record with music from a large library of songs that will continue to grow,Speed controls that give you the flexibility to be creative in your performance,And a timer and countdown to easily record, hands-free.We also recently rolled-out a prominent new spot for the create icon on Android, starting in India. We'll continue to expand to iOS devices and in more countries soon. You can also expect more creation features in the coming months. Get discovered: Every month, 2 billion viewers come to YouTube to laugh, learn and connect. Creators have built entire businesses on YouTube, and we want to enable the next generation of mobile creators to also grow a community on YouTube with Shorts. We encourage any mobile creator or artist to start uploading their existing short videos on YouTube today to start getting discovered.Watch: You may have recently seen a row on the YouTube homepage especially for short videos, and starting today we’re also introducing a new watch experience that lets you easily swipe vertically from one video to the next, plus discover other similar short videos. We're also going to make it even easier to start watching Shorts. There’s much more to come, and over the next few weeks and months, we’ll continue to roll out more creation tools and easier ways to watch short videos on YouTube as we listen to your feedback. If you want to learn more about how to create Shorts, check out our forum post.Have fun with it and let us know what you think. We can’t wait to see what you do with Shorts and look forward to empowering a new generation of mobile creators and artists on the world's largest video platform."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/happy-anniversary-fashion","date":"2020-09-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Fashion","News & Events"],"title":"Happy anniversary, /Fashion!","text":"Can you believe it’s been a year since we launched youtube.com/fashion? Like anyone celebrating anything nowadays, I couldn’t have imagined our one-year anniversary would be happening virtually. A year ago, New York Fashion Week was in full swing, and we were celebrating with the biggest names in the industry. (Gigi! Bella! Kendall! Serena! And more!) Today, I’m safely working from home, like the rest of the fashion team, whom I affectionately call my GGG’s. (Why? They’re the glitter, gold and the glue, obviously. They hold it all together and make it shine!) But our goal this year is the same as last year: Assert YouTube as your front-row seat to Fashion Week. Especially since most of the shows are rolling out digitally this year. Designed to be the ultimate destination for style content, /Fashion is a place where creators, fashion professionals, brands and publishers share, connect and inspire. In the past 12 months, /Fashion has put YouTube’s stake in the fashion ground, and brought some of the industry’s biggest names to YouTube. Naomi Campbell turned into a talk show host with her series, “No Filter with Naomi,” which kept us entertained during stay-at-home orders, and engaged in racial justice through conversations with the likes of Black model activist Bethann Hardison, photographer Tyler Mitchell and poet Cleo Wade. Also, a true trendsetter, who can forget Naomi’s iconic travel sanitizing routine? Vogue Paris has taken us inside fashion’s favorite kitchens and Interview Magazine has given us new ways to connect with our favorite celebrities, including Jennifer Aniston, Selena Gomez, and all the guys at the Sway House. We all got to go to the Met Gala this year when Anna Wintour hosted a “Moment for the Met” exclusively on Vogue’s YouTube channel. And YouTube creators like Juanpa Zurita, Emma Chamberlain, Liza Koshy and Bretman Rock brought us along as they experienced Fashion Week for the first time. We’ve welcomed fashion professionals like makeup artists Hung Vanngo and Gucci Westman, hairstylist Chris Appleton, and designer Alexander Wang to the world of YouTube. They’ve given expert makeup and hair styling advice, while entertaining us with some of their friends and helping us stay chic before and during quarantine. One my favorite moments was watching Wang give comedian Pete Davidson advice on how to be a runway model for his catwalk debut: Of course, this year was like nothing any of us expected. But if there’s one thing I know about fashion, it’s this: We’re resilient. I was thrilled to watch the industry pivot and give back to its community, whether that was transitioning fragrance companies into hand sanitizer plants, New York designers asking their ateliers to make masks, or designer Aurora James (who’s on the cover of this month’s September Vogue) introducing The 15% Pledge. On my own channel, I was thrilled to host YouTube’s first ever fashion show “from home,” which raised funds for amfAR’s Covid-19 relief initiative: So here we are, one year in: a home for fashion on YouTube. As the world turned to digital platforms, brands also turned to YouTube to engage with fans and continue the fashion week traditions. During the Haute Couture and Men’s Fashion Week in Paris this July, 93 brands showed their collections on YouTube, with 58 of them coming to the platform for the first time. From creators, who remain at the heart of YouTube, we’ve seen similarly strong growth. From 2016 to 2019, the number of Fashion & Beauty creators on YouTube grew by >400%. It’d be impossible to pick a favorite, but a show that I thought struck the right tone was Dior Homme’s video, which was a diary from designer Kim Jones’s collaboration with African artist Amoako Boafo. To help us celebrate, join me in rewatching some of my favorite fashion moments of the year, which I’ve sprinkled throughout this post. Perhaps most importantly, we want to thank you for coming to our style destination and supporting all the amazing content we’ve been lucky enough to host. Lastly, be sure to check out youtube.com/fashion, starting Monday, for incredible Fashion Month content from New York, London, Milan and Paris. (Not all of these tips I taught Emma Chamberlain for fashion week still apply, but some still do!)September is the January of fashion, so happy new year!Derek"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/expand-your-playlist-experience-youtube-music","date":"2020-09-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"Expand your playlist experience on YouTube Music","text":"There’s nothing like the perfect playlist!

Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial to hear Dr. King and the other movement leaders describe the dream of an end to systemic racism and white supremacy in the United States, in one of the most famous speeches in American history. It has now been six decades since that speech, and we are in another movement for racial justice that brings us closer to Dr. King’s dream. Today, we remember civil rights leaders, such as John Lewis, Philip Randolph, Rosa Parks and Roy Wilkins. They fought for change all those years ago, and we march alongside those who are fighting for change right now. Across YouTube today, you’ll see ways to learn more about racial justice: Explore the rich history of the civil rights movement, join in the Commitment March from home, and be inspired by the songs and stories of changemakers. We have collected some of the seminal moments from the march in our playlist The History of the March on Washington, where you can revisit the speeches and hear from the leaders of the movement.John Lewis was just 23 years old when he addressed the crowd. Here, he shares his perspective on that moment: Within YouTube Music, you’ll see a shelf presenting our newly rebranded programmed playlist, “Freedom Songs.” This programmed playlist includes powerful anthems of joy, protest and hope featuring an eclectic assembly of past and present artists such as Beyonce, Marvin Gaye, and Prince.When navigating to the Music destination on YouTube, you’ll be introduced to a March On banner that will redirect you to our livestream of the Commitment March.

This day of action — in support of criminal justice reform — will feature remarks from the Rev. Al Sharpton and alongside Martin Luther King III. We remember Dr. King’s dream. But we must also remember his call to justice:“Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.

Back in February, we provided an overview of how, over the last few years, we worked to make YouTube a more reliable source for authoritative information. And we’re continuing to build upon those priorities. Here’s an update on the work we’re doing behind the scenes.Remove election-related content that violates our policiesOur Community Guidelines set the rules of the road and we’re often reviewing and updating them, to make sure they continue to provide the appropriate protections for the YouTube community. These policies prohibit hate speech, harassment, and deceptive practices, including content that aims to mislead people about voting or videos that are technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm. We always enforce our policies consistently without regard to political viewpoints and do allow exceptions for content with sufficient educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA) value.Other timely examples include: Removing content that contains hacked information, the disclosure of which may interfere with democratic processes, such as elections and censuses. For example, videos that contain hacked information about a political candidate shared with the intent to interfere in an election.Removing content encouraging others to interfere with democratic processes, such as obstructing or interrupting voting procedures. For example, telling viewers to create long voting lines with the purpose of making it harder for others to vote.We continue to stay vigilant and coordinate closely with Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) to identify and remove the channels and accounts of bad actors engaged in foreign and domestic coordinated influence operations. TAG provides regular updates on actions taken against these operations, in its quarterly bulletin.Help you access authoritative election content from homeAs you spend more time online due to COVID-19, YouTube is a destination with a front seat for major election events. This year, most of the Democratic & Republican National Conventions will be conducted virtually. Like we have in the past, YouTube will live stream both conventions and you can follow the coverage on the YouTube channels of major news providers. Other key moments, like the debates and election results, will also be widely available on YouTube. Our work to help you easily access authoritative voting-related information on YouTube continues, and we'll continue to share updates.Additionally, we’re continuing to raise up authoritative voices and reduce the spread of harmful misinformation and borderline content, including for election-related news and information. One of the many ways we do this is through our information panels, which provide further context underneath videos and in search results, so you can make your own informed decisions. For example:In the coming weeks, when you search for 2020 presidential or federal candidates on YouTube, we’ll surface an information panel with information about that candidate—including party affiliation, office and, when available, the official YouTube channel of the candidate—above search results.Earlier this year, we expanded our fact check information panels to the United States. This feature expands upon the other ways we raise and connect you with authoritative sources, by providing fresh context from third-party fact-checked articles above search results for relevant queries—including specific claims about the election. Equip campaigns, candidates, and political creators to show up on YouTubeThroughout this election season, we’ve seen candidates and campaigns use YouTube to directly speak to and hear from a diverse set of communities. They’ve hosted town halls, sat down for in-depth interviews with creators, and created videos explaining how they’ll address America’s most pressing issues. To do this, they’ve used a range of YouTube’s features such as:Cards and end screens, to encourage action beyond YouTube, including links to approved crowdfunding sites—which now include ActBlue and WinRed.Live streaming, to hold events such as roundtables and press conferences, allowing for substantive discussions directly with the audience, in real time.Stories and Community, to interact with voters and continue the conversation, even after an official campaign event.To help navigate these features and ensure they’re using YouTube effectively, candidates and campaigns across the political spectrum receive support from our partnerships team.At YouTube, we strive to be a place where a broad range of voices can be heard. This is particularly important when we come together in the democratic process, which is why our teams at Google and YouTube are working around the clock to ensure we maintain the important balance of openness and responsibility. You can read more about the work Google is doing here, such as the expansion of our political ads policies to prohibit ads that disseminate illegally obtained materials. Our work allows us to provide access to helpful, authoritative information, prevent abuse of our systems, and enable connections with creators from a myriad of viewpoints and will continue well beyond the next Election Day."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/iseeyou-covid-19","date":"2020-08-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube News","News & Events"],"title":"#ISeeYou: Ensuring survivors are seen and heard during Covid-19","text":"While the advice for the past several months has been to “stay at home,” we know that home is not a safe place for everyone. When survivors are forced to stay in the home or in close proximity to their abuser more frequently, an abuser can use any tool to exert control over their victim, including a national health crisis such as COVID-19. During the pandemic, many survivors have been sheltering at home with abusive partners, and the spread of COVID-19 has created housing, childcare, financial, and other barriers that will continue to impact survivors’ safety long after the pandemic has ended.Recently, there have been reports of increased domestic violence during the lockdowns necessitated by COVID-19 across countries in North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia; the UN Population Fund additionally projects at least 15 million more cases of domestic violence as a result of COVID-19. During these uncertain times, it’s important to remind everyone that there are always resources available for you or someone you care about.That’s why the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) is pleased to be part of the #ISeeYou public service campaign and video to get the word out that help is available as incidents of domestic violence continue to rise. Supporting survivors of domestic violence at this time has taken on a more urgent dimension, and we honor the tireless efforts of advocates, hotlines, and programs across the country who are working every day to support survivors in need. As stay-at-home orders begin to lift in some parts of the country and survivors may no longer be in close proximity to abusive partners, requests for shelter and assistance continue to surge. NNEDV’s WomensLaw.org Email Hotline reported that COVID-related inquiries increased more than 350% from March to April and more than 200% from March to May. The National Domestic Violence Hotline reported that from March 16 to May 16, there was a 9% increase in total contacts received by the National Domestic Violence Hotline, with over 6,200 total contacts citing COVID-19 as an issue.Moreover, the pandemic, and the nation’s response to it, has further exposed the already-existing inequities in our culture in healthcare access and outcomes, employment and economic supports, and more. Data shows that women of color and Indigenous women are disproportionately affected by domestic violence. Sheltering in place is not a viable option for frontline and essential workers, many of whom are women, particularly women of color, already facing the disproportionate impacts of historical trauma, discrimination, and violence, while now facing increased exposure to the virus. Simultaneously, the historic loss of economic opportunity in this country has been especially acute for women, Black and brown communities, and workers of color, who already hold the majority of low-paid work, suffer from pay inequality, and do not have access to paid sick leave and other health benefits.  While this pandemic has significantly increased demands in a short period of time, the resilience of survivors and our work to end domestic violence in the face of overwhelming challenges is not new. But it is also crucial to support these and other hotlines and local programs, especially now. That’s why NNEDV is honored to join the #ISeeYou social campaign. We need to get the word out that there is help, especially now. And we need these large platforms for reach, so that as many victims, survivors - and those who love them - know about us. The #ISEEYOU campaign give us this crucial visibility to hotlines and other sources of support for survivors, including: The National Domestic Violence HotlineCall 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)Text LOVEIS to 1-866-331-9474Chat online at www.thehotline.org/help WomensLaw Legal Email HotlineEmail the hotline at hotline.womenslaw.org  Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN)Call 1-800-656-4673Chat online at hotline.rainn.orgOn behalf of NNEDV, #ISeeYou and I want you to know that NNEDV and our partner national organizations are here to help and support during the pandemic and beyond."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-music-will-replace-google-play-music-end-2020","date":"2020-08-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"YouTube Music will replace Google Play Music by end of 2020","text":"Over the past couple of months, we’ve been welcoming Google Play Music listeners to YouTube Music as they effortlessly transfer their music libraries, personal taste preferences and playlists to YouTube Music. Today we're announcing two important updates. First, YouTube Music will replace Google Play Music by December 2020. Users will have the opportunity to transfer their music libraries from Google Play Music to YouTube Music in that timeframe. Second, in the coming months, Google Play Music users will no longer be able to stream from or use the Google Play Music app. Additionally, we are making changes to the Google Play store and Music Manager. Starting in September 2020 in New Zealand and South Africa — and in October for all other global markets — users will no longer be able to stream from or use the Google Play Music app. But don’t worry, we will be holding onto things like your playlists, uploads, purchases, likes and more until December 2020 to make your transfer to YouTube Music easier. Users who wish to transfer their music libraries from Google Play Music to YouTube Music, can do so through December 2020, after which their Google Play Music libraries will no longer be available.Simple transfer and additional changes to Music Manager Starting in late August, users will no longer be able to purchase and pre-order music or upload and download music from Google Play Music through Music Manager. To ensure users don’t lose any of their content, they’ll need to use the simple transfer tool to migrate any purchases over to YouTube Music or use Google Takeout to export data and download their purchased and uploaded music. Once the Music Store is no longer available, users will continue to be able to upload any tracks purchased elsewhere to YouTube Music.For Google Play listeners that have not yet started the transfer process over to YouTube Music, now’s the time. Listeners can also choose to delete their Google Play Music data, and we will clearly notify all users before they lose access to their Google Play Music library and data. Enhancements to your new home for music: YouTube Music   Since introducing the transfer tool in May, we’ve continued to improve and add new features to YouTube Music for all music lovers to enjoy, including many that are important and familiar to Google Play Music users. Playlists: We’re continuously evolving the way listeners can create and enjoy playlists, including:Assistive Playlist Creation - Quickly and easily create playlists by adding recommended songs based on existing songs in the playlist, as well as personalized signals, such as watch history and likes.Collaborative Playlists - Collaborate with other music fans to create shared playlists for any occasion.New Programmed Playlists - Explore newly launched programmed playlists like Highline, Caribbean Pulse, Conditions Underground, and more.New Features and Improvements: Player Page Redesign - Updates to the player page, available for Android mobile users, provides a more modern design that allows better playback controls and easier access to related music and other features like song lyrics.Explore Tab - The new Explore tab, available on both mobile and the web is the consistent destination to find new releases including albums, singles, and music videos, as well as browse our vast catalog of diverse playlists through the Moods & Genre section More Ways to Enjoy YouTube Music:Android TV - An update for Android TV brings YouTube Music to the big screen, letting listeners enjoy videos and live performances from their favorite artists, along with all their favorite music.Google Maps - The Android integration lets listeners seamlessly listen to music and get personalized music recommendations within the Google Maps interface.Discover music with Google Assistant - You can now ask your Google Home and Nest smart speakers, “Hey Google, play recommended music from YouTube Music.” Then, Google Assistant will share personalized recommendations based on your favorite artists and genres. Over the last few years, we've worked to build a fantastic fan experience on YouTube Music, merging the very best of Google Play Music with the very best of YouTube. For users who decide not to transfer their Google Play Music account to YouTube music, we will be sure to cancel your subscription at the end of your billing cycle so you aren't paying for a subscription. This will happen in September in New Zealand and South Africa and in October for all other markets. And, of course, we will be sure to notify all users ahead of subscriptions being canceled.We can’t wait for you to start exploring YouTube Music features and discovering new music favorites along the way.

The video’s size on the page, the video resolution we deliver, our homepage’s layout — not to mention the breadth and depth of our vibrant creator and artists communities, many of whom now earn a living on YouTube. One thing that’s remained the same, though, is our YouTube blog built on Blogger. After 15 years on the site — from our very first post on July 7, 2005 — it’s time to change things up. So today we are bringing you a new destination to deliver announcements, information, updates and behind-the-scenes insights into what’s happening. This will be in addition to the other communications channels we already have across social, in-product notifications and workshops. And while I’m a little embarrassed it’s taken us 15 years to make this change, I’m really excited about the new stuff we’re going to bring you. The new YouTube Official Blog (yes, yes, I know, the name is pretty boring, but it’s the one that works best with SEO) will now be split up into four topic pages that outline the different kinds of content we want to bring to you:News & Events: You’ll see the latest happenings, launches, and biggest news here, including letters from our CEO, Susan Wojcicki.Creator & Artist Stories: Creators and artists are at the heart of YouTube, and we want the blog to reflect that. We’ll be doing more profiles on inspiring creators and artists like Beleaf in Fatherhood. You’ll see what creators are popularizing and doing on YouTube these days.Culture & Trends: So much is happening around the world and being shared on YouTube every single day. This is where we’ll write about raising chickens and how people are getting by, or finding connections, while in quarantine. Expect to see insights from our new monthly series, where we interview a Culture & Trends manager.Inside YouTube: At YouTube, there are a lot of people working day and night to make the site better. We want this section to give you an opportunity to meet some of these people. For example, in Work Diaries, one of our new series, you’ll get to follow a standard five-day workweek of YouTube’s human rights lawyer, Malika Saada Sar; and Director of Black Music & Culture, Tuma Basa (coming soon). And every month, you’ll get to know our YouTube Liaison, Matt Koval, with his column, Koval’s Corner, where he’ll do deep dives on creator issues.These are stressful and exhausting times, and it feels weird launching a blog redesign when there’s so much to feel uneasy about. But we also believe it’s more important than ever to double down on further opening the lines of communication between us and everyone in our community. So take a moment to click around, check the tires and take the new site for a spin. There’s a long way to go, but we hope it feels a bit bigger and more spacious, and ultimately, more helpful to all of you."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youre-invited-to-participate-in-life-in-a-day-2020-on-july-25","date":"2020-07-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events","News & Events"],"title":"You’re invited to participate in 'Life In A Day 2020' on July 25","text":"On July 25, executive producers Ridley Scott (“The Martian,” “Gladiator”) and Kai Hsuing (“Lords of Chaos”), along with director Kevin Macdonald (“Whitney,” “One Day in September,” “The Last King of Scotland”), invite you and the YouTube global community to pick up your cameras to create “Life In A Day 2020.”Exactly 10 years after the original “Life In A Day,” the world will once again come together to create a YouTube Original feature-length documentary that tells the story of a single day on Earth. Selected footage sourced from participants like you will be woven together in this documentary to tell the story of an ordinary day during these extraordinary times. “Life In A Day 2020” will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival and on YouTube in 2021.How the project worksOn a single day, Saturday, July 25, people around the world are invited to film their day.Maybe you'll be filming from home as you continue to navigate the coronavirus pandemic, or maybe you're in a part of the world where you're figuring out how to move forward in a transformed world. Maybe you're connecting with friends, reuniting with family, or going to work. Maybe it's a special day - you’re getting married, moving out, sharing important news. Or maybe it’s just a normal day. We want to weave together these unique experiences and perspectives to create a time capsule of this moment.The final feature film will be edited over the course of five months, crafted entirely through what is found in the submitted footage. Once the submission window closes, a 30-person team of multilingual reviewers stationed around the world will begin reviewing and translating submitted videos. Three principal feature editors - Nse Asuquo (House of My Fathers, The Jazz Ambassadors), Mdhamiri Á Nkemi (The Pale Horse, Blue Story), and Sam Rice-Edwards (Whitney) - will then undertake an enormous post-production effort, working alongside director Kevin Macdonald, to shape the film's final narrative out of the submitted footage. Who can take partThe filmmakers are encouraging people from all over the world to take part, and they hope to capture a wide perspective on life. Submissions are open from July 25 to August 2, which means you will only have one week to submit your footage at lifeinaday.youtube.While only a small number of the submitted clips will make it into the movie, YouTube and the filmmakers hope the filming day itself becomes a significant day of global participation. The “Life In A Day 2020” project celebrates the importance of everyone coming together in a moment of equal, worldwide collaboration. About the original filmIn 2010, “Life In A Day” brought the YouTube community together for a massive participatory feature film project that attracted 80,00 submissions. The final film premiered at Sundance in 2011, was released globally in theatres, and has been watched on YouTube over 16 million times."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-update","date":"2020-06-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube TV","News & Events"],"title":"To our YouTube TV members: an update to our content and price","text":"In 2017, we introduced YouTube TV, live TV designed for the YouTube generation — those who want to stream TV when and how they want, without commitments.

This feature is available on TV screens now and will come to mobile devices in the coming weeks.Control over your recorded content: In addition to your unlimited DVR space, YouTube TV members can pause, rewind, and fast forward through all their recorded shows, regardless of network.Go easy on the eyes with Dark Mode: We recently introduced a dark theme to both desktop and mobile devices to help tone down your screen’s glare and experience YouTube TV with a dark background.Mark a show as watched: You now have an option to select “Mark as Watched” on desktop and mobile devices for any TV show you’ve already seen, a top requested feature from our members.A fresh new look for the Live Guide: Based on your feedback, we’ve updated the Live Guide on desktop so you can see what’s on, now, and also scroll ahead 7 days into the future.An update to your priceAs we continue to evaluate how to provide the best possible service and content for you, our membership price will be $64.99.

Existing subscribers will see these changes reflected in their subsequent billing cycle on or after July 30.We don’t take these decisions lightly, and realize how hard this is for our members.

It's all included in the base cost of YouTube TV, with no contract and no hidden fees.While we would love every member to continue to stay with our service, we understand that some of you may choose to pause or cancel your membership.

But one thing remains consistent: When they’re looking for something personally relevant to them, they turn to YouTube.Whether it’s celebrating this year’s graduating class with the likes of President and Mrs. Obama, Beyoncé and BTS in YouTube Originals’ “Dear Class of 2020,” reminiscing over Game 6 of the 1993 NBA finals or attempting quarantine glow-ups from James Charles, YouTube’s extensive video library creates a truly meaningful and personal experience for viewers.And, this year more than ever, we’re seeing people make time for what matters. On June 13, viewers tuned in to watch “Bear Witness, Take Action,” a YouTube Originals live stream that assembled artists and activists to learn, heal and raise awareness for the Equal Justice Initiative. This was part of a new multi-year, $100 million-dollar fund to help amplify the voices and stories of Black Creators.Today, at our ninth annual NewFront event, we celebrated moments like these through a more personal experience for brands and advertisers with “Brandcast Delivered.”Throughout the completely reimagined virtual event, we celebrated the diversity of YouTube’s voices and content. Featuring appearances from creators like Lilly Singh, Questlove, Emma Chamberlain and Gordon Ramsay, we constructed a “personal primetime” for each attendee based on their passions and shared how YouTube’s deep connection to people’s lives means better results no matter a marketer’s goal – from reach and awareness to action.

In the U.S. alone, over 100 million people watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month.5 And, according to Comscore, YouTube makes up 41% of ad-supported video streaming watch time.6Last month, we announced YouTube Select — a reimagination of Google Preferred — to make it easier to reach your audiences where they are watching, and find the right content for your brand. YouTube Select includes the same popular creator content, plus a dedicated streaming TV lineup that combines the best of YouTube TV and core lineups content, both on TV screens.YouTube Select also includes YouTube Originals programming, including the breakout hit, “Instant Influencer with James Charles,” which hit over 50 million views in its first month alone;7 “Retro Tech,” featuring tech guru Marques Brownlee; and “Liza on Demand.” And they’re all returning for new seasons.Additionally, today we announced that Demi Lovato will be returning for a new YouTube Originals project. Demi’s new docuseries will be a follow-up to her 2017 documentary, “Simply Complicated,”which will bring you on her personal and musical journey over the last three years. David Blaine will also be joining the YouTube Originals slate with a first-of-its-kind special event. We are excited to share more on these shows, among many others, throughout the year.Uncover new audience insights and convert demand into actionYouTube has become an important part of the modern purchase journey with 70 percent of YouTube viewers saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on our platform.8 We’re introducing tools to help marketers understand their audience, as well as complement their awareness initiatives with campaigns that drive conversions.As people turn to YouTube to discover their next purchase, we’re also seeing an increase in conversions from ads on the platform.

That’s why we’re hosting Camp YouTube: a digital learning experience to help parents recreate the fun of summer camp at home.With Google searches for “virtual summer camps” spiking over the past few weeks, we want to help parents structure this new normal. Starting today, Camp YouTube will spotlight content on the Learn@Home site and YouTube Kids across beloved summer camp themes, such as arts, adventure, sports, STEM, and more.

FOR THE ADVENTURE LOVERIf you’re looking to bring the outside in, we’ll have an adventure camp that will help you explore the world around you and appreciate nature. Teenagers can enjoy wildlife, unscripted and unedited, with Explore.org; learn how to examine the outdoors the way scientists do when they’re doing fieldwork with The Brain Scoop or discover dinosaur fossils and organisms from all over the planet with the American Museum of Natural History.We’ll also have a dedicated section for families with kids under 13 across each camp theme, where parents and kids can watch summer camp-themed videos on YouTube Kids that encourage creativity, curiosity, playfulness and offline activities.

They can learn coding with Goldieblox, or complete fun and weird science activities with PBS KIDS. We know this summer may be a bit different for a lot of us. However, with the help of creators on YouTube, we hope you and your families can experience the magic of camp from home!"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-youtube-brandconnect-platform-creators-and-brands-collaborate","date":"2020-06-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","News & Events"],"title":"Introducing YouTube BrandConnect, a platform for Creators and Brands to collaborate","text":"Every day, people come to YouTube to connect with their favorite creators, and in the process, they discover new products they love. In turn, this creates a valuable opportunity for brands to reach new audiences on YouTube and partner with creators to amplify their message. Over the years, we’ve seen branded content grow on YouTube, thanks to the direct connection creators have with their fans. In fact, the influencer marketing industry as a whole is projected to reach $15 billion by 2022.Given the success our brands and creators have seen with branded content on YouTube, we are evolving FameBit to YouTube BrandConnect. What YouTube BrandConnect offersThrough YouTube BrandConnect, we’re making it easier for creators and brands to create branded content that is both authentic and effective. Our focus will continue to be supporting and driving revenue to creators, providing measurable campaigns for brands, and reaching viewers with authentic and relevant content. We’ve built unique, industry-first features within our branded content platform to support each of these goals.On the creator side, we’ve developed insights-based matchmaking tools that allow more access to branded content deals for eligible creators across YouTube. Because of the connection that creators have with their fans, our proactive matchmaking produces highly engaging and relevant branded content. And it’s working - over the past two years, average deal size across the full service product grew more than 260%.YouTube creators have a real-time pulse on their community and have the flexibility to pivot their content to serve audience (and brand) needs, something we’re seeing firsthand right now. For example, the Reese’s brand’s March Madness campaign took a turn when the annual basketball tournament was cancelled due to the pandemic. Creators including 2Hype, Smosh Pit, and Eh Bee Family were able to adapt their previously-shot content to still bring a relevant vibe to fans at home, while driving strong consumer engagement and awareness for Reese’s Miniature Cups newly designed packaging, which was perfect for a stay-at-home game of couch basketball.For brands, we’ve added new measurement solutions like Brand Interest Lift, Influencer Lift, and organic view-through conversations that provide them with real-time campaign results and bring the accountability of digital advertising to branded content campaigns. Brand Interest Lift allows advertisers to measure consumer search behavior resulting from viewing the creator’s video, and Influencer Lift measures consumer sentiment on Purchase Intent, Brand Recall, and more. Through Google insights and tools, it is possible for brands to measure the impact and ROI of influencer marketing for the first time on YouTube.We’ve also introduced several ads technology innovations such as the shopping shelf and app shelf to help viewers buy products and download apps being discussed in creators' videos directly from the watch page. This will soon expand to a new media shelf, where viewers can buy or rent movies and shows. We’ve also introduced new technologies like the AR try-on experience that allow viewers to virtually try on and shop products, alongside their favorite creators.Eligible creators in the U.S. with 25,000+ subscribers will be able to sign up for YouTube BrandConnect directly in YouTube Studio, where we’ll be adding more campaign management features in the coming months. With YouTube BrandConnect, brands can easily connect and measure branded content campaigns with their Google and YouTube advertising strategies - allowing for full-funnel influencer marketing integrations. Looking forward with YouTube BrandConnectWe’re always looking for new ways to help creators earn more money, and we’ve added additional resources to help creators get started making branded content on Creator Academy. We’ll continue investing in our technology and expanding internationally to bring new experiences to creators, brands and their fans globally. This is just the beginning for YouTube BrandConnect, and we’re excited to bring even more value to creators, brands, and viewers through branded content campaigns in the months ahead."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/bear-witness-take-action","date":"2020-06-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Originals","YouTube Black Voices","News & Events"],"title":"Bear Witness, Take Action","text":"“ 'This is a time when we can actually make some ground' — Kimberlé Crenshaw, Executive Director of the African American Policy Forum and Professor of Law at UCLA and Columbia.” Over the past few weeks, we have mourned the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade — and the other known and unknown victims of racial terror and violence. These killings occurred against the backdrop of a global pandemic that disproportionately ravaged the Black community and surfaced entrenched racial inequities. In our anguish, we have taken to the streets in protest — in every state and around the globe — to demand the dismantling of systemic racism in society.On Saturday, June 13, Common and Keke Palmer hosted a conversation called \"Bear Witness, Take Action\" to create a virtual space. It raised awareness on the urgent need for racial justice, and supported the Equal Justice Initiative. It featured conversations with creators including Jouelzy and Ambers Closet; prominent activists including co-founders of Black Lives Matter; Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors; Bryan Stevenson, founder of Equal Justice Initiative; bestselling author Roxane Gay; journalist Soledad O’Brien; and powerful musical performances from John Legend, Trey Songz, Brittany Howard and many more important voices. The effort to combat racial inequality will take continued work from all of us. Last week, Susan Wojcicki shared YouTube’s commitment to the Black community, and we will continue those efforts in the months and years ahead.These are some ways that you can take action to end police violence against Black Americans and promote a more equitable world for all people:ReadLearn about policies and proposed changes like those available via The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights or Center for Policing Equity. Learn about the history and struggle for racial justice through resources like those available at the Equal Justice Initiative.

It’s a strange and hard time to be entering this new stage of life, but each speaker delivered a unique message of hope to the next generation of leaders. There were tributes, there were performances and moments of surprise-and-delight planted throughout. (Hint: You’ll hear an arrangement from Finneas O’Connell, plus an appearance from a classic, animated American sitcom.) From the Obamas to Lady Gaga and Beyoncé, the over four-hour event also peppered in celebrity powerhouses like J.Lo and Mariah Carey. “Dear Class of 2020” definitely can’t replace the feeling of physically walking across a stage to receive your diploma, but it was memorable. The 10 following quotes left more than an impression on us. These words will be ringing in our heads in the days to come, as we ready ourselves for the second half of 2020. 1. President Barack Obama“America changed — has always changed — because young people dared to hope. As someone once said, 'Hope is not a lottery ticket. It’s a hammer for us to use in a national emergency to break the glass, sound the alarm and sprint into action.” 2. Beyoncé “Look how far you’ve come and how much you’ve contributed. Keep pushing. Forget the fear. Forget the doubt. Keep investing and keep betting on yourself.”3. Jimmy Kimmel“I know this is a lousy time to enter the real world, but years from this, you will have what few people do: a cool story. Know what year I graduated high school? 1985. You know the most interesting thing that happened in 1985 was? “Police Academy 2,” ‘kay? Look it up. But when you tell people the year you graduated, everyone will be super interested, they’ll wanna know what was it like? Did you live underground? Did you used to touch hands with each other? Who did you take to the prom: your mom or your dad? Did the president really tell people to drink bleach?”4. Alicia Keys: “You, my friends, you are graduates in the most powerful time to be coming of age. And there’s nothing and no one that can stop you from changing the world. I see you. You’re unstoppable. We honor you and celebrate you.” 5. Sundar Pichai“You will prevail.” (Read his transcripted speech here.)6. Michelle Obama“In an uncertain world, time-tested values like honesty and integrity, empathy and compassion — that’s the only real currency in life.” 7. Liza Koshy“You should also know you’re not alone. You’ve got a lot of company. And being stuck at home meant you had to find creative new ways to celebrate, which made #DearClassof2020 really blow up.8. Stephen Colbert“I have no doubt you will be the heroes of so many who have not yet been born. And years from now, if you have the good fortune to hold your own child’s face in your hands and tell them how proud you are of them, you’ll understand how we feel about you right now. And they’ll wonder how you did what you are about to go do.” 9. Malala Yousafzai“Don’t be defined by what you’re losing during this crisis, but by how you respond to it.” 10. Sec. Condoleezza Rice “You are the next generation of Americans who will fight for what is right, and one day make impossible seem inevitable.”"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-music-transfer-google-play-music-library","date":"2020-05-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["YouTube Music","News & Events"],"title":"YouTube Music is making it simple to transfer over your Google Play Music library","text":"Over the past few years, we have enhanced YouTube Music to deliver a comprehensive listening experience, and have also added features to make Google Play Music users feel right at home.

Unfortunately, over the past several months we've seen a rise in the hijacking of YouTube channels. We take account security seriously and, in addition to continuously improving our monitoring and systems, want to help creators keep their accounts safe by encouraging them to take these three steps:1. Create a strong password and never share it or reuse it on other sites.A secure password and updated recovery information, like adding your phone number to your Google Account, can help protect it. Also, never enter your password information on any page other than account.google.com since that’s one way passwords are stolen. If you work with a team, do not share your password with them, either.2. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google account for extra protection in addition to monitoring who has access to your account.It's easier than you think for someone to steal your password, through phishing, malware, data breaches and more. Adding 2-Step Verification means that you’ll protect your account with both your password and additional information — like a prompt on your phone, or a physical device like a security key — to confirm it's really you.For your account to be as secure as possible, you should make sure all Google accounts with access to your channel have 2-Step Verification enabled. This includes everyone listed under the channel permissions section in your settings. Also consider using the Advanced Protection Program for an extra level of security.3. Stay vigilant of phishing and malware scams.Knowing what to look for means you can get ahead of potential scams. Look out for any emails that ask for your account login information — legitimate emails from YouTube about your account will never ask for your login information. If you suspect an email may be a phishing or malware scam, don’t click on any links before verifying they are correct by hovering over them. Ensure the email address and sender names match, and look out for any downloads or attachments — especially ones that are very large or run a program on your computer. These can be malware that when downloaded may cause extensive damage to data and computers or may be used to gain unauthorized access to your network.On World Password Day and every day, we want to help you ensure your accounts are secure. Follow these three simple tips and go to the Google Security checkup to review and adjust your security settings to help you keep your account secure."},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/expanding-fact-checks-on-youtube-to-united-states","date":"2020-04-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Products & Features","News &

identify four YouTube partners whose subscriber numbers are growing but haven’t yet reached 100,000. You get the opportunity to vote for your favorite, each channel is evaluated on criteria such as viewer engagement and channel optimization techniques, and one of the four channels is featured on the YouTube homepage and across our social networks. In past months, featured partners like JoshSundquist, CuteGirlsHairstyles, and strskillschool have seen growth in their fan base and video engagement thanks to your support.This month, we’re taking a brief hiatus from asking you to vote on emerging YouTube talent while the On The Rise program undergoes a bit of a face lift. We’ll be back in 2013, but in the meantime, we wanted to give YOU - the fans and viewers - more of a say about which channels really are on the rise.We’re excited to announce that you can now nominate a YouTube partner to be considered for the “On The Rise” program. Feel free to submit nominations for your own channel, or for channels you follow that you think deserve more attention or could be the next YouTube sensation. We’ll continue to feature promising partners who have fewer than 100,000 subscribers and produce engaging content on a regular basis.As always, thanks for participating and helping some of YouTube’s promising content creators grow their fan base!"},{"platform":"YouTube","url":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-next-how-to-guru-could-you-be","date":"2012-12-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","News & Events"],"title":"YouTube
