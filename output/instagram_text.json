Presented in partnership with the Brooklyn Museum, the #BlackVisionaries grants include five $100,000 Visionary Small Business grants and five $30,000 Emerging Visionary grants, awarded with the support of Meta Open Arts. As part of the museum’s commitment to the local community, one of this year’s Visionary Small Business grant recipients is based in Brooklyn. Black Fashion Fair, The Black School: Design Studio, Dark Matter U, Strada and Brooklyn-based Pacific have been awarded the Visionary Small Business grants Christopher Joshua Benton, Anaïs Duplan, Albert Hicks IV, Jaline McPherson and Cornelius Tulloch have been awarded the Emerging Visionary grants These artists, designers and small business owners think in expansive, experimental ways. Their work spans disciplines, including poetry, visual design, spatial design, sculpture, photography, film, experiential design and education. But a commitment to community unites them. They join the 2021 Black Visionaries in creating community, creating culture and creating change. “All of the selected Visionaries truly personify a conscious engagement with today's cultural moment. There are a vast number of social factors at play that have invoked this certain urgency for Black artists to think about their practices in a way that can help nurture and empower the community.”— Antwaun Sargent, writer, curator and #BlackVisionaries Creative Chair Grant recipients were selected from nearly 2,000 applications by a committee of Black artists and designers, led by Antwaun Sargent, including Elle Decor Editor-in-Chief Asad Syrkett, Academy Award-winning costume designer Ruth E. Carter and Director of Metaverse Design at Meta, Ian Spalter. With the support of Mobile Makers, a nonprofit organization offering design and skill-building workshops for creative youths, each recipient will also be connected with a community of mentors.

By cultivating retail spaces and experiences, Black Fashion Fair supports the ideas and continued growth of Black designers and Black-owned brands. “Black designers should not only be recognized when there is a spotlight placed on them, but also when there isn’t. We have been able to create impact without any of the traditional industry resources or access. This grant will allow us to grow and become a repository for Black fashion.”- Antoine Grégory, Founder & Creative Director @blackfashionfairEmerging Visionary: Christopher Joshua Benton (@christopherjoshuabenton) Photo by: Elias Williams Christopher Joshua Benton is an American artist based in Boston and working in film and installation. Christopher works closely with communities to instigate collaboration and share stories of power, labor and hope. Inspired by his years living in the United Arab Emirates, his research investigates traces of the homeland in the diaspora. “My work spotlights the beauty, innovation and richness of black and brown diasporic people – and the contributions that these communities contribute to the everyday practices we enjoy. If art is a lens to see and understand our surroundings, my goal is for people to better see themselves, understand their place on the planet and feel with the people around them.”- Christopher Joshua BentonVisionary Small Business: Pacific (@pacific_pacific) Photo by: Elias Williams Pacific is a multidisciplinary creative studio and publishing house based in Brooklyn. Founded by Elizabeth Karp-Evans and Adam Turnbull in 2017, the studio’s work is centered on creating design and communication systems that innovate and build community at the intersection of art, publishing, placemaking, technology and culture. They seek to cultivate long-lasting creative relationships that result in community and individual growth, new modes of social exploration and engagement. They also work to put enduring objects in the hands of the public. “There is no good design or bad design, only design that is successful (or not) in engaging you to think, question, discover and process. This philosophy is about accessibility; everyone should be able to understand our design, which means there is no one way to design.”– Elizabeth Karp-Evans, PrincipleEmerging Visionary: Cornelius Tulloch (@corneliustulloch) Photo by: Melody Timothee Cornelius Tulloch is a Miami-based interdisciplinary artist and designer. With work transcending the barriers of photography, fine art and architecture, he combines creative mediums to tell powerful stories. His interdisciplinary practice is inspired by Black and Caribbean cultures, histories and everyday life. “People tried to discourage me from pursuing a career in art, and when entering architecture school, others told me that ‘Black people can’t be architects.’ But now I stand here as both. These statements fuel me to continue impacting both industries in meaningful ways, celebrating Black stories and perspectives.”- Cornelius TullochVisionary Small Business: Dark Matter U (@darkmatter_u) From left: Jennifer Newsom, Justin Garrett Moore, Camille Sherrod, Jerome Haferd, Nupur Chaudhury.

An ever-growing democratic network, its core team includes Jerome Haferd, Venesa Alicea-Chuqui, Germane Barnes, Bryan C. Lee Jr., Justin Garrett Moore, Jennifer Newsom, Quilian Riano and Tya Winn. “Dedicating material resources and funds to support and uplift BIPOC voices is central to the mission of Dark Matter U, and the only way to change the design fields. Design is culture. And furthermore, as interdisciplinary designers and architects, we believe that design and Black/POC imagination is literally crucial to the creation of a new society.”-Jerome Haferd, architect, public artist and educatorEmerging Visionary: Anaïs Duplan (@an.duplan) Photo by: Elias Williams Anaïs Duplan is a trans* filmmaker, poet and author who often works in video poetry and lecture performances. In 2016, Anaïs founded the Center for Afrofuturist Studies (@afrofuturist.center), an artist residency program for artists of color in Iowa City, where he received his MFA, and where he remains a curator. “My work is committed to the creative strategies used by Black and brown artists to vie for personal and social liberation. In my practice, I take up an investigation of these strategies through video poetry and virtual performance.”– Anaïs DuplanEmerging Visionary: Albert Hicks IV (@alberlaurentiv) Photo by: Elias Williams Albert L Hicks IV is one half of Ayem, a design and research studio he founded alongside Marcus Washington Jr. Ayem is an emerging design and research based platform interested in how communities, spaces, and objects shape culture, language and perspective. As they develop Ayem, their ethos remains true to their own identities. “In design, historically, there is an invisible barrier that prevents cross cultural ideas and collaboration; a direct reflection of global society. Ayem believes that understanding, appreciating, and including other perspectives can become the gateway to powerful imaginations and can help to empower voices that aren’t recognized.”– Albert L Hicks IVEmerging Visionary: Jaline McPherson (@jaline.creates) Photo by: Elias Williams Jaline McPherson is a designer, artist and writer who seeks to elevate stories of Black cultural landscapes and ethnobotanical histories. Her most recent research used plants, reimagined public spaces and magic to create an abundant future for the first Black Freedman’s town in the U.S. She believes that design and storytelling can help redefine healing and joy for Black and brown communities. “The fields of landscape architecture and the built environment are far too often dominated by a white majority who are tasked with designing many of our public spaces and environments. Therein lies a unique opportunity to challenge traditional methods of landscape design and expand upon new strategies for designing with communities of color.”– Jaline McPhersonVisionary Small Business: Strada (@strada.world) Photo by: Elias Williams Paul Hill was 22 when he founded Strada, a New York-based art gallery and online marketplace creating equitable opportunities for emerging artists. Strada’s physical exhibitions are platforms for artists who have been overlooked. Born and raised in Harlem, Hill is also recognized for creating community-based solutions to complex problems. His first app, Pronto!, served as a database for volunteers and donors fighting for Black Lives Matter. “I really want to create a place that, at first glance, is a really innovative space — pioneering a new path within this antiquated system and opening up the doors for people to join in and contribute to making this change.”– Paul HillVisionary Small Business: The Black School: Design Studio (@theblackschool) Taylor Hunter, with photo assistant Renia Johnson The Black School, founded by Joseph Cuillier and Shani Peters, teaches Black history and creativity using a three-part ecosystem: art workshops, a festival and a full-service design firm and consultancy specializing in community-centered graphic design. Creative Director Joseph Cuillier and Education Director Shani Peters use a community-engaged approach to design products, environments, experiences and systems. “I think community — and a strong community — is the best hope we have going forward in this country and beyond. For me, community is power. But it's not just power how we conventionally think about it. It's a strong power. It's a soft power. It's care, it's love, it's safety, it’s protection, it's self determination. It's all of those things. It's what sustains us, and I think it's going to be what delivers us.”– Joseph Cuillier"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/tips-and-tricks/instagram-live-producer","date":"2022-11-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Tips & Tricks","Product"],"title":"Instagram Live Producer","text":"Disclaimer: Live Producer is limited access at this time.How do I go live on Instagram using streaming software?Instagram Live Producer will allow you to go live on Instagram using streaming software (OBS, Streamlabs, etc.) through a stream key. This integration opens up production features outside the traditional phone camera, including additional cameras, external microphones and graphics. This feature is only available on instagram.com. Tech requirements Before broadcasting live with streaming software, make sure that your video meets the following specifications. Learn more about setting up streaming software. Our recommended settings have been tested to optimize quality and experience for viewers on many devices and networks: Video format9x16 aspect ratio (recommended but not required) 720p @ 30 fps (note: 30 fps is recommended, but Live Producer can also support 60 fps if desired. When using 60 fps, the Live Producer preview screen will still display 30 fps. This is normal and we are currently investigating how to correct this.) Resolution: 720x1280 Video bitrate range: 2,250–6,000 Kbps Alternatives (supported but not recommended): 480p @ 30 fps, 360pAudio format—the settings below are the default for most streaming platforms, including OBS: Sample rate: 44.1 KHz Channel layout: Stereo Bit rate: up to 256 Kbps Setup Select which streaming software you’ll be using for your event. (Examples include Streamlabs, OBS and Streamyard.) Open your streaming software interface and locate where to input your URL and stream key. The URL and stream key (see below for more details) will allow you to broadcast your streaming software setup directly to Instagram Live. Open instagram.com and click the “Add post” button (plus symbol inside a square) and select “Live” from the dropdown menu. Within the “Go live” screen, enter the title of your live video and select your audience: “Practice” will not broadcast to anyone and “Public” will broadcast to your followers as a normal live video would. You will then see a screen that contains your unique URL and stream key, with instructions on how to use them. You have the option to either copy the stream key or reset it in the event you need a new one. Note: The stream key is not static, and will refresh each time you use Live Producer. Streaming to Instagram Live Within your streaming software, use your URL and stream key to add Instagram Live as your streaming endpoint. Note: Instagram Live will need to be added as a “Custom RTMP”. Selecting Custom RTMP will allow you to add a URL and stream key. The location of where to input a custom RTMP differs between platforms, but most often can be found in stream settings. Once you’ve set up your stream to look how you want, start it on your streaming software. Within the Live Producer viewer on instagram.com, you’ll see a preview of what your stream will look like on Instagram Live. The Live Producer preview should mirror what you’ve set up on the streaming software. The preview can take a few seconds to display in the preview screen. Once you’ve seen and confirmed your preview, click “Go live” within Live Producer to start the stream. Once live, the “Comments” tab will let you read and respond to comments from viewers. When you want to end the live video, click “End live video”. NOTE: If you end your stream in the streaming software before you end your Live Producer broadcast, the live video will continue while displaying the last frame received from the streaming software. In order to end your live video smoothly, end the broadcast on Live Producer first before ending the stream on the streaming software. Comment Management Once live, the “Comments” tab will let you read and respond to comments from viewers. Clicking a comment will toggle a menu with the following options: “Report”, which will flag the comment for inappropriate behavior. “Pin comment”, which will keep the comment at the top of the feed. You can remove a pinned comment by clicking the “X” to the right. Saving your post live video VOD You can view, share and download your completed broadcast within the Live Archive. To access the Live Archive: While on your profile tap the menu (3 horizontal lines) button in the top right corner. Within this menu, tap the Archive button. Tap the dropdown at the top of the screen and switch from “Stories Archive” to “Live Archive.” You will then see your past completed live videos and be able to share to Instagram or download to your device."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/creator-safety-tools","date":"2022-10-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","Instagram","Announcements","Safety"],"title":"Updates to How We Protect Our Community from Abuse","text":"Now, when you block someone you'll have the option to block other accounts they may already have, making it more difficult for them to interact with you again on Instagram. To help protect more creators from harmful message requests and comments, we'll test automatically turning on Hidden Words for people who use a Creator account. We’ve also made improvements to Hidden Words to protect people from seeing scammy message requests or offensive Stories replies, among other things. We’re expanding our use of nudges to encourage more people to pause and reflect before they say something that could be hurtful in comments or message requests. Making Block Better We want to make it as hard as possible for someone you’ve blocked to contact you again. Now when you block someone, you'll also have the option to block other accounts they may have or create, making it more difficult for them to interact with you on Instagram. Last year, we updated how blocking works on Instagram to give you the ability to not only block a single account, but also any new accounts that person may create. This update allows you to also block existing accounts that person may already have. Based on initial test results from this new change, we expect our community will need to block 4 million fewer accounts every week, since these accounts will now be blocked automatically. New Updates to Hidden Words Since launching Hidden Words last year, more than one in five people with large followings1 have turned on the feature, giving them a powerful tool to automatically filter harmful content from their comments and message requests. We've seen that Hidden Words has been really effective at keeping people safe. When people1 turn on Hidden Words for comments, on average, they see 40% fewer comments that might be offensive. We want to help more creators benefit from this protection, so we're starting to test automatically turning on Hidden Words for Creator accounts. Everyone will continue to be able to turn these settings on or off at any time and build a custom list with additional words, phrases, and emojis they may want to hide. We’re also continuing to improve Hidden Words to offer more protections, including: Expanding Hidden Words to cover Story replies, so offensive replies from people you don’t follow will be sent to your Hidden Requests folder and you never have to see them. Supporting new languages, including Farsi, Turkish, Russian, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, and Tamil. Improving our filtering to spot and hide more intentional misspellings of offensive terms, for instance, if someone uses a “1” instead of an “i”. Adding new terms to filter message requests that might contain scams or spam. We’ll start doing this in English in certain countries, with more languages and countries coming soon. Nudging People to Be Respectful in Comments and DMs We’ve learned that there are cases where people mean well but may misjudge how their words could negatively impact others — especially when they’re interacting online. We’ve seen that nudges can reduce the amount of hurtful remarks on Instagram, which is why we’re introducing more of them. Now, a new notification will encourage people to pause and consider how they want to respond before replying to a comment that our systems tell us could be offensive. These nudges are live now for people whose apps are set to English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Chinese or Arabic. We’ve also started reminding people to be respectful in DMs when sending a message request to a creator. This nudge helps people remember that there’s a real person on the other side of their DM request, and encourages more respectful outreach to people they may not know. We’re rolling out this reminder globally in the coming weeks. We’ll continue to work on more ways to protect people from abuse on Instagram, while encouraging supportive and respectful conversations. 1 People with more than 10,000 followers."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/tips-and-tricks/control-your-instagram-feed","date":"2022-08-29T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Tips & Tricks"],"title":"How to See More of What You Want on Instagram","text":"It’s important to us that you feel good about the time you spend on Instagram, so we’re always working on ways to give you more control over what you see. Our ranked feed prioritizes posts we think you’re most likely to enjoy, but we understand that we may not always get it right. There are a number of ways you can shape your experience on Instagram and see more of what you want on your feed. Understand how we personalize your feedOne of the ways we personalize your feed is by predicting how likely you are to do something with a post you see. The more likely you are to take an action, and the more heavily we weigh that action, the higher up you’ll see the post in your feed. There are many interactions we take into consideration, but five interactions we look at most closely are how likely you are to spend a few seconds on a post, comment on it, like it, reshare it, and tap on the profile photo. You can learn more about the signals that help us personalize your Instagram here.Add accounts to Favorites and see their posts higher in your feedWhen you add an account to your Favorites, you’ll see their posts higher and more often. And you can see a dedicated feed of just your favorites to quickly catch up on their posts. There are no suggested posts in this view, and we never share who’s in your Favorites list. To choose your Favorites, tap the Instagram logo at the top left and add up to 50 friends, family members, creators, or businesses. You can also tap the three-dot menu on any post and then select ‘Add to favorites’ directly from your feed.See posts from accounts you follow in chronological orderFollowing shows posts just from accounts you follow, starting with the most recent post first. As with Favorites, there are no suggested posts in this view, and you can see the last 30 days of posts to catch up on what you may have missed. To see posts in chronological order just from the accounts you follow, tap the Instagram logo on Home and choose Following.Make suggested posts more relevant for youYour feed is personalized for you and includes a mix of posts from accounts you follow, and suggested posts from accounts you don’t follow but may be interested in. We also show you suggested posts in places like Explore, as well as the Shop and Reels tabs. Today, suggested posts in feed are one way people discover new creator accounts on Instagram and how creators reach new audiences. Suggested posts are personalized for you based on what you interact with on Instagram, and you can provide feedback so that suggested posts are more relevant to your interests.Use the ‘Not Interested’ controlWhen you see a post you don’t find interesting or relevant, tap the three-dot menu and then select ‘Not Interested’, or tap the X at the top right of a suggested post on Home. Tapping ‘Not Interested’ removes the post from your feed immediately, and we’ll suggest fewer posts like it in the future.Adjust your 'Sensitive Content Control’We’ve always had rules about what kind of content can be on Instagram, we call these Community Guidelines, for example, we don’t allow hate speech, bullying, and other content that might present a risk of harm to people. But you may see content that doesn't break the rules, but could be upsetting to some. We recognize that everybody has different preferences, so you can decide to leave things as they are, assuming you’re satisfied with your experience today, or you can adjust the Sensitive Content Control to see more or less of some types of sensitive content. For people under the age of 18, the “More” option is unavailable. To view your Sensitive Content Control go to your profile, tap the Settings menu, tap Account and tap Sensitive Content control. Snooze suggested posts Suggested posts in your feed are posts from accounts you don’t follow but may be interested in. If you want to take a break from suggested posts in your feed, you can easily snooze them for 30 days. To snooze suggested posts, tap the X on the top right corner, and then tap ‘snooze all suggested posts for 30 days’. You can also tap the three-dot menu and select ‘Not Interested’ on a specific post so that we can improve the quality of your suggested posts.We’re testing new controls We’re always working on ways people can help shape what they see across Instagram. We are now testing the ability to select multiple posts within Explore and mark them as ‘Not Interested’ all at once. Like ‘Not Interested’ in feed, we’ll immediately hide those posts and refrain from showing you similar content in the future. In addition, we’ll soon start testing the ability to tell Instagram you don’t want to see suggested posts with certain hashtags or caption keywords. Whether you’re seeing something that’s not relevant, or have moved on from something you used to like, you can use this feature to stop seeing content that’s not interesting to you.We hope these controls can help you get more out of your feed. We're always working on ways to further personalize your feed, so stay tuned for new features that will help you see more of what you want on Instagram."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/hands-free-instagram-with-samsung-flip-phones","date":"2022-08-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Create Hands-Free on Instagram With Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Smartphones","text":"Today, we’re introducing a new way to create hands-free on Instagram with Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4, as well as other Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Smartphones.

Additionally, we now support wallet connections with the Coinbase Wallet and Dapper, as well as the ability to post digital collectibles minted on the Flow blockchain. We’ve been so inspired by the creators who have shared their digital collectibles. Natalie Amrossi (@misshattan), an aerial and street photographer, used the feature to drive awareness of some of her work and in return, has seen an increase in sales. We have also seen people share and display NFT artwork they have collected to support their fellow creators. “NFTs have opened the doors to new opportunities for me and other artists around the world. This new technology provides us with another outlet to make a living and to connect with our fans and collectors. Instagram has helped build careers for so many creatives, including myself, and now our communities can support us further by sharing our work on the platform.” - @misshattan Expanding access to more people Today we’re starting international expansion to 100 countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and the Americas. In order to post a digital collectible, all you need to do is connect your digital wallet to Instagram. As of today, we support connections with third-party wallets including Rainbow, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet and Dapper Wallet. Supported blockchains at this time include Ethereum, Polygon and Flow. There are no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram. Our continued commitment to equity, safety and sustainability It’s critical that we continue to build in this space responsibly by reducing barriers to entry, making sure that this technology is safe and approachable for people, and reducing the environmental impact of our product. Here’s what we’re doing to achieve this: We focus on empowering diverse voices. Through this expansion, we aim to improve accessibility and help make the NFT space more inclusive. NFTs have made it possible for more diverse artists to gain exposure and monetize their work outside of traditional channels. By enabling more people around the world to share their digital collectibles on Instagram, we’re able to open new pathways for artistic connection and monetization. We want Instagram to be a safe and enjoyable place for everyone. Therefore, people can use our tools to keep their accounts secure and report digital collectibles which go against our community guidelines. We are committed to building in this space with sustainability in mind. Meta will help reduce the emissions impact that might be associated with the display of digital collectibles on Instagram by purchasing renewable energy. Learn more about our commitment to sustainability here. What’s next? As access to digital collectibles expands, we aim to educate broad audiences on the space, including through our @creators’ ‘NFTeach Me’ series. Across Meta, we’re exploring a wide range of web3 technologies because we believe they will expand access, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation, empowering people and creators around the world. We are excited to continue listening to feedback from creators and collectors as we continue to build in this space."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/collecting-and-measuring-demographic-information","date":"2022-07-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements","Safety"],"title":"Understanding How Different Communities Experience Instagram","text":"When we established the Equity team, we wanted to understand how people from historically marginalized communities experience Instagram. For the last two years, we prioritized extensive research to better understand the concerns raised by these communities, and we made significant improvements in our products as a result. However, if we don’t know people's race or ethnicity, we’re limited in our ability to assess how our products impact different communities. To better understand different experiences people may have on Instagram we need to collect and measure demographic information, like race and ethnicity. Starting today, we'll ask a random assortment of people on Instagram in the United States to participate in an optional survey where they can share this information. How it Works Over the next few months, people on Instagram in the United States may see a prompt asking them for their race or ethnicity. This leads to a survey hosted by YouGov, an international research group that helps companies securely run surveys. Individual, de-identified responses are collected by YouGov, encrypted, and split into parts to be stored across partner research institutions. Instagram will only have access to aggregated information, which means we can’t connect people or their Instagram accounts to their individual responses. More details on how this methodology works are available in our technical paper. We’re working with Texas Southern University, University of Central Florida, Northeastern University, and Oasis Labs as partner research institutions. These institutions will receive the split, de-identified responses from YouGov, and then share an aggregated analysis with Instagram. Neither Instagram nor the institutions will be able to connect responses to individuals or their Instagram accounts. “The method used by Meta to analyze how people of different races and ethnicities interact with Instagram is very secure,” said Dr. Zhishan Guo, assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCF, one of the research universities partnered with Meta. “User responses are encrypted and split apart, with distributed algorithmic computations and data storages at different institutions, so no one can link survey responses to Instagram accounts.”“Our mission is to provide the most honest and accurate data through transparent, fully-permissioned interactions with consumers around the world. We are excited to use this capability to help Meta better understand the experiences different communities have and build more equitable products.” - Stephan Shakespeare, CEO, YouGov“Texas Southern University is proud to join the Meta Civil Rights Team to be positioned at the intersection of technology and urban research. Our faculty and team members in TSU's Division of Research and Innovation, along with our other schools and colleges, will collaborate to ensure this partnership is a success to benefit communities of color.” - Michelle Penn-Marshall, VP for Research and Innovation at Texas Southern University How We’ll Use This Information This information will allow us to better understand the experiences different communities have on Instagram, how our technology may impact different groups, and if there are changes we can make to promote fairness. For example, the analysis we conduct with this information might help us better understand experiences different communities may have when it comes to how we rank content. Additional details: Participating in the survey is not required. It is 100% optional. We will not tie your survey response back to you or any of your specific accounts. Your survey response is encrypted. Instagram and all Meta platforms, YouGov, Oasis, and the academic institutions do not have the ability to link your response back to your Instagram account. This will not limit the experiences that you have on Instagram, including impacting your reach or how people engage with your content in any way. With our method, individual survey responses cannot and will not be used in our ads system. This information will not be stored with partner institutions in perpetuity. Responses will be deleted by YouGov after 30 days and by Texas Southern University, University of Central Florida, Northeastern University, and Oasis Labs on request."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-create-with-reels","date":"2022-07-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing New Ways to Collaborate and Create with Reels","text":"Today, we're announcing new features to Instagram that make it more fun and easy to collaborate, create and share reels.

Easily Create Reels With Templates and Dual We want everyone to be able to easily express their creative ideas, so we’re adding more features that allow you to capture, edit and share them — right from your phone. Templates: Need a little inspo? Templates allow you to easily create reels by preloading audio and clip placeholders, so you can simply add your own photos or video clips. You can find template ideas by tapping the camera icon on the Reels tab. Dual: Record content and your reaction at the same time. You can record using your phone’s front and back cameras simultaneously to share another perspective using the Dual feature in the Instagram camera. New Video Posts on Instagram Will Be Shared as Reels Since reels offer a more immersive and entertaining way to watch and create videos on Instagram, we’re bringing these creative tools and the full-screen experience to your video posts, too. In the coming weeks, new video posts shorter than 15 minutes will be shared as reels. Videos posted prior to this change will remain as videos and won’t become reels. Discovery: If you have a public account, your new videos – now reels – may be eligible to be recommended and seen by more people on Instagram. This currently applies to reels that are under 90 seconds long. If your account is private, your reels will still only be shown to your followers. Profile: We’ll also consolidate the video and Reels tab on your profile, so there will be one home for all of your videos. We’re always working on ways to improve your Instagram experience. We'll continue to build features that make it easier and more fun to create and share reels on Instagram."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-and-brooklyn-museum-debut-2022-blackvisionaries-program","date":"2022-06-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","Design","Business","Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Instagram and Brooklyn Museum Debut 2022 #BlackVisionaries Program With $650,000 in Grants","text":"To empower, center and invest in aspiring Black voices within art and design, we are debuting the 2022 #BlackVisionaries program together with the Brooklyn Museum. As part of this debut, we are awarding $650,000 in grants to Black artists, Black designers and Black small businesses. For the last three years, we’ve collaborated with the Brooklyn Museum and Antwaun Sargent (writer, curator & #BlackVisionaries Creative Chair) to uplift and support historically excluded creative voices. And today we work together to uplift, center and invest in Black voices and organizations working in art and design. Last year, the #BlackVisionaries program awarded five Black designers, including a Black-led small design business, $205,000 in grants. This year, we will award 10 #BlackVisionaries grants in partnership with the Brooklyn Museum. This includes five $100,000 Visionary Small Business Grants for Black-led organizations in the US focused on design. With the support of Meta Open Arts, we’re also awarding five $30,000 Emerging Visionary Grants for individuals focused on art and design based in the U.S. Applications for this year’s #BlackVisionaries program open on June 28 and close on July 29, and you can apply here. Instagram and the Brooklyn Museum will also award mentorship to each grant recipient together with Mobile Makers, a nonprofit organization that offers youth design and skill-building workshops in Chicago and Boston communities. Grant recipients will be selected by a committee of artists and designers led by Antwaun Sargent, including Elle Decor Editor-in-Chief Asad Syrkett, Academy Award-winning costume designer Ruth Carter and Head of Design at Instagram Ian Spalter. “Most folks who don’t have traditional pathways into spaces like the arts and design just need opportunity,” says Sargent. “A grant like this could mean a world of opportunity.” Apply to the 2022 #BlackVisionaries program today."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-ways-to-verify-age-on-instagram","date":"2022-06-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing New Ways to Verify Age on Instagram","text":"Update on March 2, 2023 at 6 am PT: Starting today, we’re beginning to expand our age verification test on Instagram to more countries in Europe, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Australia, and Japan. We plan to make our age verification tools available in even more countries globally within the next few months.- - -Update on October 13, 2022: Starting today, we’re expanding this test to additional countries including India and Brazil. We plan to expand to the UK and EU before the end of the year. We’re also removing Social Vouching as an option to verify age from the test to make some improvements.- - - We’re testing new options for people to verify their age on Instagram, allowing us to provide age-appropriate experiences. In addition to providing an ID, people will now be able to ask others to vouch for their age, or use technology that can confirm their age based on a video selfie. We’re partnering with Yoti, a company that specializes in privacy-preserving ways to verify age. Starting today, we’re testing new options for people on Instagram to verify their age, starting with people based in the US. If someone attempts to edit their date of birth on Instagram from under the age of 18 to 18 or over, we’ll require them to verify their age using one of three options: upload their ID, record a video selfie or ask mutual friends to verify their age. We’re testing this so we can make sure teens and adults are in the right experience for their age group. We are also partnering with Yoti, a company that specializes in online age verification, to help ensure people’s privacy. In 2019, we began asking people to provide their age when signing up for Instagram. Since then, we've made this a requirement. Knowing people’s age allows us to provide appropriate experiences to different age groups, specifically teens.We require people to be at least 13 years old to sign up for Instagram. In some countries, our minimum age is higher. When we know if someone is a teen (13-17), we provide them with age-appropriate experiences like defaulting them into private accounts, preventing unwanted contact from adults they don’t know and limiting the options advertisers have to reach them with ads.Testing New Ways to Verify AgeIn addition to having someone upload their ID, we’re testing two new ways to verify a person’s age: Video Selfie: You can choose to upload a video selfie to verify your age. If you choose this option, you’ll see instructions on your screen to guide you. After you take a video selfie, we share the image with Yoti, and nothing else. Yoti’s technology estimates your age based on your facial features and shares that estimate with us. Meta and Yoti then delete the image. The technology cannot recognize your identity – just your age. Social Vouching: This option allows you to ask mutual followers to confirm how old you are. The person vouching must be at least 18 years old, must not be vouching for anyone else at that time and will need to meet other safeguards we have in place. The three people you select to vouch for you will receive a request to confirm your age and will need to respond within three days.You will still be able to upload your ID to verify your age with forms of identification like a driver’s license or ID card. We will use your ID to confirm your age and help keep our community safe. Your ID will be stored securely on our servers and is deleted within 30 days.We worked with international youth, privacy and safety experts to inform our approach. You can learn more about these three options and how to set them up here.Partnering With YotiWe’re partnering with Yoti, a company that offers privacy-preserving ways to verify age. Yoti is verified by the Age Check Certification Scheme and is the leading age verification provider for several industries around the world including social media, gaming and age restricted e-commerce. Expert and governmental organizations in youth and privacy, including the German regulator KJM, have publicly endorsed Yoti for their approach and expertise in responsible artificial intelligence (AI).Yoti notes that it trains its dataset on anonymous images of diverse people from around the world who have transparently allowed Yoti to use their data and who can ask Yoti to delete their data at any time. For people under the age of 13, Yoti collected data using specific data collection exercises where parents or guardians have given explicit consent.Using AI to Understand People’s AgesIn addition to testing the new menu of options to verify people’s ages, we also use AI to understand if someone is a teen or an adult. AI helps us prevent teens from accessing Facebook Dating, adults from messaging teens and helps teens from receiving restricted ad content, for example. Our goal is to expand the use of this technology more widely across our technologies. To learn more about how our technology works, and the advancements we’re making in artificial intelligence, you can review our AI blog post.Our Approach to PrivacyThe information provided in each age verification option is used to confirm your age and won’t be visible on your profile, to friends or other people on Instagram. If you choose to upload a video selfie to verify your age, Meta and Yoti delete it once your age is confirmed. Your video is not used for anything else other than to verify your age. If you choose to upload an ID, after you send us a copy of your ID, it'll be encrypted and stored securely.Understanding someone’s age online is a complex, industry-wide challenge. We want to work with others in our industry, and with governments, to set clear standards for age verification online. Many people, such as teens, don’t always have access to the forms of ID that make age verification clear and simple. As an industry, we have to explore novel ways to approach the dilemma of verifying someone’s age when they don’t have an ID.We still believe an effective way of addressing this problem is for devices or App Stores to provide apps with people’s ages, allowing teens to be placed in age-appropriate experiences across all the apps they use. In the absence of industry standards or regulation on how to effectively verify age online, we’ve invested in a combination of technologies that are more equitable, provide more options to verify age and that protect the privacy of people using our technologies."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/tools-and-resources-for-parents-and-teens-in-vr-and-on-instagram","date":"2022-06-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"New Tools and Resources for Parents and Teens in VR and on Instagram","text":"Today, we’re announcing new tools and resources designed to support parents, guardians and teens across our technologies. Parents will soon be able to set up supervision tools in VR to all Quest headsets and use new supervision features available with Instagram, like sending invites to their teens to initiate tools and setting specific times to limit their teen’s use. Supervision tools on Instagram are beginning to roll out globally. We’re also continuing to add features to help teens better manage the time they spend on Instagram with new nudges and reminders to use our Take a Break feature.Parental Supervision Tools and Resources for QuestWe’re beginning to roll out parental supervision tools to all Quest headsets. In the Parent Dashboard, parents and guardians can: Approve their teen’s download or purchase of an app that is blocked by default based on its IARC-rating. Teens 13+ can submit an “Ask to Buy” request, which triggers a notification to their parent. The parent can then approve or deny the request from the Oculus mobile app. Block specific apps that may be inappropriate for their teen, which will prevent the teen from launching those apps. Apps that can be blocked include apps like web browsers and apps available on the Quest Store. View all of the apps that their teen owns. Receive “Purchase Notifications,” alerting them when their teen makes a purchase in VR. View headset screen time from the Oculus mobile app, so they’ll know how much time their teen is spending in VR. View their teen’s list of Oculus Friends. Block Link and Air Link to prevent their teen from accessing content from their PC on their Quest headset. For parents to link to their teen’s account, the teen must initiate the process, and both the parent and teen have to agree.We’re also launching our new Parent education hub, including a guide to our VR parental supervision tools from ConnectSafely to help parents discuss virtual reality with their teens.This is just a starting point, informed by careful collaboration with industry experts, and we’ll continue to grow and evolve our parental supervision tools over time.Expanding Parental Supervision Features on Instagram- - -Update on September 14, 2022 at 6:00PM PT: Today, we’re beginning to roll out parental supervision tools on Instagram globally. Parents around the world will be able to access Family Center and set up tools with their teen to supervise their Instagram experience. With these tools, parents and guardians can: View how much time their teens spend on Instagram and set time limits Set specific times during the day or week to limit their teen’s use of Instagram Be notified when their teen chooses to report an account or post, including who was reported and the type of content View what accounts their teens follow and the accounts that follow them - - -On Instagram, parents and guardians can now: Send invitations to their teens to initiate supervision tools. Initially, only teens could send invitations. Set specific times during the day or week when they would like to limit their teen’s use of Instagram.See more information when their teen reports an account or post, including who was reported, and the type of report.If you already have supervision set up on Instagram in the US, these updates are now available in addition to our other supervision tools. Starting this month, these tools will begin rolling out to other countries including the UK, Japan, Australia, Ireland, Canada, France and Germany, with plans to roll out globally before the end of the year. Visit our Family Center to learn more. Support Teens’ Time on InstagramOn Instagram, teens will start to see new nudges. Teens in certain countries will see a notification that encourages them to switch to a different topic if they’re repeatedly looking at the same type of content on Explore. This nudge is designed to encourage teens to discover something new and excludes certain topics that may be associated with appearance comparison.We designed this new feature because research suggests that nudges can be effective for helping people — especially teens — be more mindful of how they’re using social media in the moment. In a study on the effects of nudges on social media use, 58.2% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that nudges made their social media experience better by helping them become more mindful of their time on-platform. Our own research shows they’re working too: during a one-week testing period, one in five teens who saw our new nudges switched to a different topic. We launched our Take a Break feature to remind people to take time off Instagram. Soon, we’ll launch new reminders for teens to turn on Take a Break when they’ve been scrolling in Reels for a period of time. The reminders will feature Reels developed by young creators like @foodwithsoy, @abraxaxs and @mayasideas who share their own tips for taking a break and why it’s a good idea to get off social media for a bit. These are being tested in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand now, and they’ll launch in those and additional countries later this summer.We’re also empowering US-based young creators through funding and education to share more content on Instagram that inspires teens and supports their well-being. An Expert Steering Committee of experts in child psychology and digital literacy will provide guidance on evidence-based ways for creators in the program to use language that strengthens emotional well-being and self image, how to create responsible content online and how creators can look after themselves and their communities on and offline.Expert-backed Resources We’re adding new articles to the Family Center education hub from organizations like ParentZone, Media Smarts, National Association for Media Literacy Education and Cyberbullying Research Center. These articles give parents helpful tips on how to talk to teens about different online topics such as connecting safely with others and how to be more self-aware online. We’ll continue working with experts and organizations to make even more resources for parents and guardians available. We also are adding a new privacy page with more information for teens about privacy settings, defaults and features across Quest, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. How We Build Safe Experiences and Products for TeensTo build products and experiences that help keep young people safe, we work directly with teens, parents and experts. Over the past few years, we’ve incorporated best practices from the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and children’s rights groups.Today, we’re sharing more detail on an internal process we created to help us apply the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in our product development. The Convention emphasizes that the “best interests of the child” should steer the creation of services, products, and experiences for young people. Our process guides our teams on how to apply this standard when developing digital experiences for people under 18 using our technologies. Read more about our Best Interests of the Child work, and how it informs the experiences we create for young people.“It is really encouraging to know that Meta has been listening to young people and their parents and creating tools that encourage timely conversations. At Parent Zone, we know how difficult it can be for parents when they feel locked out of their children’s digital worlds. With these new tools, we are seeing a shift to greater partnership between families and platforms and that is an incredibly positive step.” - Vicki Shotbolt, founder and CEO of Parent Zone“With VR technologies increasingly gaining traction, and the Quest becoming a favorite product of many youth, parents and guardians will now have access to a suite of tools to safeguard and stay involved with their teen's participation and experiences. We're glad that Meta continues to seek out data-driven insight from scholars and practitioners in various social scientific fields to build solutions that seek to equip youth, families and educators with the tools and resources they need to safely enjoy exploring and interacting on their favorite platforms.” - Dr. Sameer Hinduja, Co-Director of the Cyberbullying Research Center"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/updates-to-the-sensitive-content-control","date":"2022-06-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Updates to the Sensitive Content Control","text":"Updated August 25, 2022 The Sensitive Content Control has only two options for teens: “Standard” and “Less.” New teens on Instagram under 16 years old will be defaulted into the “Less” state. For teens already on Instagram, we will send a prompt encouraging them to select the “Less” experience. This will make it more difficult for young people to come across potentially sensitive content or accounts in Search, Explore, Hashtag Pages, Reels, Feed Recommendations and Suggested Accounts. In addition, we are testing a new way to encourage teens to update their safety and privacy settings. We’ll show prompts asking teens to review their settings including: controlling who can reshare their content, who can message and contact them, what content they can see and how they can manage their time spent on Instagram. These updates are some of the ways we are working to protect teens on Instagram. - - - We’re continuously developing controls to help people personalize their experience on Instagram. Last summer, we launched the Sensitive Content Control so people could choose how much or how little sensitive content to see in Explore from accounts they don’t follow. Today, we’re announcing updates to this control. Starting today, the Sensitive Content Control will cover all surfaces where we make recommendations. In addition to Explore, you will now be able to control the amount of sensitive content and accounts you see in Search, Reels, Accounts You Might Follow, Hashtag Pages and In-Feed Recommendations. With this update, we’re also applying the technology we use to enforce our Recommendation Guidelines to Instagram's recommendations on Search and Hashtag pages. This update will be available to everyone in the coming weeks. The Sensitive Content Control has three options, which we’ve renamed from when we first introduced the control to help explain what each option does. The three options are: “More”, “Standard” and “Less”.“Standard” is the default state, and will prevent people from seeing some sensitive content and accounts. “More” enables people to see more sensitive content and accounts, whereas “Less” means they see less of this content than the default state. For people under the age of 18, the “More” option is unavailable.To view your Sensitive Content Control: Go to your profile. Tap the Settings menu in the upper right corner. Tap Account. Tap Sensitive Content Control. Here you can decide whether to keep the setting at its default state (“Standard”) or to see more (“More”) or less of some types of sensitive content (“Less”). You can change your selection at any time. There are additional tools we offer that can help you shape your Instagram experience, including Comment Control, Restrict, Block and Mute. Our hope is to provide more tools over time and make Instagram work better for you.

This feature will start rolling out today, and be fully available in 25 countries in the coming weeks. Since 2015, AMBER Alerts on Facebook have been successful in helping authorities find and quickly locate missing children. Today, we’re bringing AMBER Alerts to Instagram for the first time. This feature was developed in partnership with organizations like the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US, the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children, the National Crime Agency in the UK, the Attorney General’s Office in Mexico, the Australian Federal Police and more.We know that the chances of finding a missing child increase when more people are on the lookout, especially in the first few hours. With this update, if an AMBER Alert is activated by law enforcement and you are in the designated search area, the alert will now appear in your Instagram feed.The alert will include important details about the child such as a photo, description, location of the abduction and any other available information that can be provided. People can also share the alert with friends to further spread the word.These alerts are rare and specific to the search area. If you get one, it means there is an active search for a missing child nearby. In order to know who to show these alerts to, we use a variety of signals, including the city you list on your profile, your IP address and location services (if you have it turned on).“Instagram is a platform based on the power of photos, making it a perfect fit for the AMBER Alert program,” said Michelle DeLaune, President and CEO at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. “We know that photos are a critical tool in the search for missing children and by expanding the reach to the Instagram audience, we’ll be able to share photos of missing children with so many more people.”AMBER Alerts on Instagram will start rolling out today, and be fully available in the next couple of weeks in 25 countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Ecuador, Greece, Guatemala, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Romania, South Africa, Taiwan, Ukraine, the UK, the United Arab Emirates and the US. We’re working to expand and bring them to more countries.In 2015, we launched AMBER Alerts on Facebook. Since then, the alerts have assisted in hundreds of successful child endangerment cases in the US and around the world.For example, in 2020, Amanda Disley and her husband helped rescue 11-year-old Charlotte Moccia of Springfield, Massachusetts after seeing an AMBER Alert on Facebook. And in 2016, an AMBER Alert was issued after a four-year-old girl was abducted in Lakeland, Florida. Kaytlin Brown, an anesthesia technician at Baptist East Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee was on her lunch break when she saw the alert on Facebook, recognized the missing child and quickly took action. AMBER Alerts are an important way we can support our communities in keeping children safe, and we look forward to continuing this work."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-visual-refresh","date":"2022-05-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Design","Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing Instagram’s Visual Refresh","text":"Today, we're bringing new energy and purpose to our colors, typeface, logo and other brand elements with a refreshed visual identity.

Illuminating our gradient Our vibrant gradient was reimagined using an innovative 3D modeling process to make it feel illuminated and alive. The Instagram gradient, made up of our brand colors, is the foundation of our complete color system.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 2.2 billion people live with vision impairments and over 430 million people live with hearing loss. To better meet the needs of these and other disability communities, Instagram includes support for a variety of accessibility features built into iOS and Android, and we have developed and refined our own in-app accessibility features. Today, we’re providing more information about all of Instagram’s accessibility features through Instagram operated accounts like @creators. In @creators’ latest post, we explain the importance of using accessibility features, from alt-text to auto-generated captions, to create a more positive experience for your audience. For years, Instagram has offered existing features such as dark mode and screen reader improvements. Additionally, we improved our automatic and custom alternative text options for people with vision impairments. If you’re interested in how we’re working to make Instagram more accessible for screen readers, check out our blog post called Crafting an Accessible Instagram Feed. Additionally, we improved our automatic and custom alternative text options for people with vision impairments. First, we launched automatic alternative text; this feature uses object recognition technology to generate a description of photos for screen readers. Then, we introduced custom alternative text, giving creators the ability to add their own image descriptions before posting. However, this alone is not enough. We’ve also started rolling out numerous closed caption features to enrich the Instagram experience for our Deaf and hard of hearing communities. Currently, ⅓ of video plays on Instagram are with the sound off, so closed captioning is one way to improve both the experience for and engagement-retention of all users. Here are 3 other ways we support the more expansive use of captions: Auto-generated captions for Instagram Video: In March 2022, we made auto-generated captions the default for creators. When uploading a video, captions will be created automatically and remain on unless manually turned off. When viewing a video, you can tap the three dots (...) in the upper right corner and select “Manage captions” to toggle captions on and off. Auto-generated captions are supported globally on Android and iOS in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Arabic, Vietnamese, Italian, German, Turkish, Russian, Thai, Tagalog, Urdu, Malay, Hindi, Indonesian and Japanese. We’ll continue building out this tool in the coming months, and will provide updates as we do. Captions sticker on Stories: We announced the Captions Sticker in May 2021. When creating a video on Stories, go to the sticker tray, select Captions and then rewatch your video to view the auto-generated text. If you want to change something, tap the word (or words) and edit the text. Captions sticker on Reels: When we launched the Captions Sticker for Stories, we shared our plans to bring the sticker to Reels too, which we did, just a few months later in July 2021. This sticker works the exact same way in Reels as it does in Stories, automatically converting audio to text. In addition to these features, we’re encouraging creators to think about how to use our products to promote and expand accessibility. For example, in March 2021 we launched Live Rooms, giving creators the option of going live with up to 3 additional people. Since its release, creators have used Live Rooms to include American Sign Language interpreters in public meetings like press briefings and constituent Q&As. This is just the start. We believe everyone deserves equitable access to the tools necessary to be effective and efficient communicators on Instagram.

With the incredible opportunity of blockchain technology, they can now leverage new tools to earn income, and fans can support their favorite creators by purchasing digital collectibles – art, images and videos, music or trading cards – as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Starting this week, select creators and collectors can share their digital collectibles on Instagram. Creators are using new technologies like NFTs to take more control over their work, their relationship with their fans, and how they can monetize. At Meta, we're looking at what creators are already doing across our technologies in order to improve the experience, help them create more monetization opportunities, and bring NFTs to a broader audience. Introducing Digital Collectibles We’re beginning to test digital collectibles with a handful of U.S. creators and collectors who will be able to share NFTs on Instagram that they have created or bought. This feature includes: Connecting a digital wallet. Once connected, creators and collectors will have the ability to choose which NFTs from their wallet they would like to share on Instagram. Sharing digital collectibles. Once a creator or collector posts a digital collectible, it will have a shimmer effect and can display public information, such as a description of the NFT. Posts will also be visible on their profile. Automatic tagging of both the creator and collector. The creator and collector can be automatically attributed in the digital collectible post (subject to their privacy settings). We collect and organize public data from open blockchains, such as Ethereum, to provide this feature. From this public blockchain data, we can only identify which collectibles belong to collectors and creators when they connect their third-party wallets to Instagram. Starting at launch, the blockchains that will be supported are Ethereum and Polygon, with Flow and Solana coming soon. The third-party wallets compatible for use will include Rainbow, MetaMask and Trust Wallet, with Coinbase Wallet, Dapper, and Phantom coming soon. There will be no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram. It’s critical that our early efforts in this space empower diverse voices and that underrepresented groups have access to emerging digital assets like NFTs. By building support for NFTs, we aim to improve accessibility, lower barriers to entry, and help make the NFT space more inclusive to all communities. It is also important that we keep Instagram a safe and enjoyable place for everyone. Therefore, people can use our tools to keep their accounts secure and report digital collectibles which go against our community guidelines. In addition, we understand that blockchain technology and NFTs raise important questions on sustainability. Meta will help reduce the emissions impact that might be associated with the display of digital collectibles on Instagram by purchasing renewable energy. Learn more about our commitment to sustainability here. We will expand access to digital collectibles soon, bringing the benefits of NFT ownership to even more creators and collectors. For now, if you want to see digital collectibles in action, you can follow these accounts: @adambombsquad, @bluethegreat, @bossbeautiesnft, @c.syresmith, @cynthiaerivo, @garyvee, @jenstark, @justmaiko, @maliha_z_art, @misshattan, @nopattern, @oseanworld, @paigebueckers, @phiawilson, @swopes and @yungjake. “I feel excited to be able to share my NFT journey with the community I’ve been cultivating on IG for over ten years! I love how this new feature will let collectors trace the art back to the artist and be a part of the community that they have been building on IG for so long. I also love how it bridges my traditional art community and the Women Rise NFT community.” - @maliha_z_art“As a purpose driven NFT brand on a mission to remind women that they can be everything they want to be, Boss Beauties couldn’t be more excited to drive even more visibility and awareness through Instagram’s global community! We can’t wait to reach more women so we can educate and empower them to learn about all that is possible through web3 and NFTs.”- @bossbeautiesnft What’s Next? Across Meta, we will continue listening to feedback as we embark on this new area of investment for the company. Soon, we’ll be rolling out digital collectibles on Facebook, and allow people to display and share their digital collectibles as AR stickers in Instagram Stories. You can read more about our AR efforts here. Over the coming months, we will explore additional features to provide further benefits of this technology to creators and collectors."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shop-live-on-instagram-this-mothers-day-2022","date":"2022-04-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Shop Live on Instagram this Mother’s Day","text":"Mother’s Day is right around the corner — still shopping for a mom who deserves the world?

This announcement is part of our ongoing work to improve how you connect and share with your closest friends. Today, we're introducing seven new messaging features. As we announced at the end of last year, we're making more investments in messaging on Instagram to help you connect with your closest friends in more seamless and fun ways. Browse and chat at the right time We’ve made several improvements that help people respond, share, and chat: Reply while you browse: Receive a new message while you’re browsing your feed? You can now reply without going to your inbox and losing your place.

We’re rolling this out first to a handful of hashtags that are focused on popular and long-standing movements on Instagram and in the world, like #BlackLivesMatter, #womensrights and #climatecrisis. We’re making it easier to raise awareness of these causes by sharing the hashtag page via DM or creating a fundraiser. Today, we're beginning to test a new feature that helps people find and support social movements on Instagram. People often come to Instagram to make their voices heard, elevate causes and bring communities together. They’re eager to support causes they hear about on Instagram and are always looking for new ways to take action — these updates will make it easier to do so. Discovering Social Movements and Taking Action With this new feature, you’ll be able to support, fundraise and spread the word about the social causes centered directly through hashtags. Hashtags have long been a place where people discover new causes to support on Instagram, and now when you search for specific hashtags associated with certain movements, you’ll have the option to support them. “Support” shows more information about the movement, “Spread the Word” lets you share it with your friends via DM, and “Create a Fundraiser” lets you start a fundraiser on behalf of the movement. In addition to hearing directly from our community, we consulted with a number of organizations, including the GLAAD, NAACP, Advancing Justice – AAJC, Hispanic Heritage Foundation, Othering and Belonging Institute, and IllumiNative to select the initial list of hashtags.

We want you to be able to shape Instagram into the best possible experience, and giving you ways to quickly see what you’re most interested in is an important step in that direction. What are Favorites and Following? Your Instagram feed is a mix of photos and videos from people you follow, suggested posts and more. Over time, we’re going to add more recommendations to your feed based on your interests — Favorites and Following are new ways to catch up on recent posts from the accounts you follow. Favorites shows you the latest from accounts that you choose, like your best friends and favorite creators. In addition to this view, posts from accounts in Favorites will also show up higher in your home feed. Following shows you posts from the people you follow. Both Favorites and Following will show you posts in chronological order, so you can quickly catch up on recent posts. To use Favorites and Following, tap on Instagram in the top left corner of your home page to choose what you see. How your favorites list works Use Favorites to see the most recent posts from the accounts you’ve added to your favorites list. You can add up to 50 accounts to your list, and make changes to this list at any time — people are not notified when they are added or removed. Posts from accounts on your favorites list will also show up higher in your home feed, as shown by a star icon. More choice and control over what you see in your feed We’re always working on new ways to improve your Instagram experience. We'll continue to build features like Favorites and Following to give you more choice and control over what you see, and help make the time you spend on the app feel more intentional."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-family-center-and-supervision-tools","date":"2022-03-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing Family Center and Parental Supervision Tools on Instagram and in VR","text":"Today, we’re introducing Family Center, a new place for parents and guardians to access supervision tools and resources from leading experts. Supervision tools are available on Instagram today, and will begin rolling out in VR in May. This is the first step in a longer term journey to develop intuitive supervision tools, informed by experts, teens and parents. Our vision for Family Center is to eventually allow parents and guardians to help their teens manage experiences across Meta technologies, all from one central place. Parents and guardians know what’s best for their teens, and in December I committed to developing new supervision tools that allow them to be more involved in their teens’ experiences.Today, we’re making these supervision tools available in our new Family Center. We worked closely with experts, parents, guardians and teens to develop Family Center, a new place for parents to oversee their teens’ accounts within Meta technologies, set up and use supervision tools, and access resources on how to communicate with their teens about internet use.This is just one step on a longer path — our vision for Family Center is to eventually allow parents and guardians to help their teens manage experiences across Meta technologies, all from one central place. An Education Hub for Parents and Guardians Family Center includes a new education hub where parents and guardians can access resources from experts and review helpful articles, videos and tips on topics like how to talk to teens about social media. Parents can also watch video tutorials on how to use the new supervision tools available on Instagram today. We worked closely with groups like Connect Safely and Net Family News to develop these resources, and we’ll continue to add new information to Family Center’s education hub. New Supervision Tools on Instagram Supervision tools on Instagram are available in the US today, with plans to roll out globally in the coming months. Our first set of parental supervision tools on Instagram will allow parents and guardians to: View how much time their teens spend on Instagram and set time limits. Be notified when their teen shares they’ve reported someone. View and receive updates on what accounts their teens follow and the accounts that follow their teens. Learn more about how to set up supervision on Instagram. Teens will need to initiate supervision for now in the app on mobile devices, and we will add the option for parents to initiate supervision in the app and on desktop in June. Teens will need to approve parental supervision if their parent or guardian requests it.Over the next few months we’ll add additional features, including letting parents set the hours during which their teen can use Instagram and the ability for more than one parent to supervise a teen’s account.VR Parental Supervision Tools We’re also announcing VR parental supervision tools that will roll out to Quest in the coming months. As a first step to giving people more customized control over their VR experience, we’ll expand the functionality of our existing unlock pattern on Quest headsets, starting in April. This will allow parents to prevent teens 13+ from accessing experiences they feel aren’t age-appropriate by using an Unlock Pattern to lock access to those apps. And in May, we’ll start automatically blocking teens 13+ from downloading IARC rated age-inappropriate apps. We’ll also launch a Parent Dashboard, hosting a suite of supervision tools that will link to the teen’s account based on consent from both sides.While we have involved young people, parents and experts in our product design process for a long time, we always look for more ways to incorporate their feedback directly. One way we’re doing this is through the Trust, Transparency and Control (TTC) Labs and our global co-design program — a multidisciplinary research program that engages and empowers young people, parents, guardians and experts to collaborate with us in the product design process. We used insights from this program to inform how we built our supervision tools, and will continue to do so as we introduce more features for families over time.As always, we appreciate the input from experts who help us deepen our understanding of this area, so we can continue protecting teens, supporting families and preserving all the good that young people derive from the internet.“The co-design process has clearly shown that teens like to be able to call on their parents for support and guidance, but often don’t know where or how to begin. By proposing parental supervision tools across apps, Meta will help overcome this hurdle. Especially since the tools are unobtrusive, respectful of privacy, and offer the ideal training wheels for younger teens building their competence and confidence in the online social environment.”– Janice Richardson, International Advisor at Insights SA“Encouraging informed parental engagement in their children’s digital presence is an important way to support young people’s wellness online. Parents can model and mentor the use of these powerful tools for their children, engaging in these spaces alongside their children to provide opportunities for learning. Parents can support and monitor their children’s gradual increase in independence as they demonstrate responsible and safe use, with respect for others and for themselves. By engaging parents as co-learners with their children, we can support their parenting in the digital ecosystem in ways consistent with their parenting in the physical world, setting their children up for long-term physical, mental, and social wellness.”– Dr. Michael Rich, Director and Founder at Boston Children’s Hospital’s Digital Wellness Lab“We’re happy to see the new tools Meta is launching to support parents in helping their children navigate the various social apps. Our research shows that regular parental supervision and co-participation is the best way to inoculate kids from the worst aspects of the internet. We’re hopeful that parents will take advantage of these new resources, and will continue to collaborate with Meta in their efforts to make their products safer and more enjoyable for families.”– Justin Patchin, Co-founder and Co-director at Cyberbullying Research Center"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/alim-smith-featured-meme-artist-in-living-color","date":"2022-02-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","Announcements"],"title":"Instagram Announces Alim Smith (@yesterdaynite) as Featured Meme Artist for In Living Color: A Celebration of Black Joy through Love & Laughter","text":"With the evolution of memes, one of the internet’s most recognized forms of expression, comes the evolution of meme artists. For Black History Month, we’ve partnered with Alim Smith (@yesterdaynite) to showcase this ever-changing form of artin a live event. For this partnership, Smith created 25 oil paintings to showcase the most iconic Black memes in his unique style. We sat down with the creator to understand his process, from style to plan and execution. Q: There are a lot of memes across the internet, what about the ones you selected are special for this moment to showcase your work? A: Because it’s Black History Month, and these ones stuck out to me the most. And it could be—not even related to people— it could be related to my own inner feelings. I might have chosen the memes that capture how I feel right now. I feel like the ones I did previously had a lot more levity. Not that these don't and others are all just like sad or mad frustrated expression. But they have a little bit more feeling than other things I’ve painted. I feel like the emotions that I chose really capture pandemic energy. They capture how the world feels right now to me, at least or what the world looks like to me right now. Q: How did you come up with your art style? How did memes become the basis of some of your artwork, notably the Crying Jordan meme? A: I went to art school from sixth grade to 12th grade. Like a drawing school — Cab Calloway School of the Arts. I had to apply to get in—I had to apply like three times to get in, and I didn't get in in high school when I applied, so I had to apply two times just to get back into the same spot that I was already accepted into. I got in. We [students] did no painting, no colorful pictures, really no cartoons. It was just all drawing just straight up black and white. “How good are you? Can you draw what's in front of you in real life?” So that's a big part of my style because it just made me lean towards realism or detailed things in general.When I would sit down, drawing on a piece of paper, I would draw a face or I would draw an object and it would look just like the object. The shading would be accurate, everything would be accurate. But when I would pick the piece of paper, it would be so lopsided. I couldn't tell that it was that off when I was looking at it, sitting. So over time, I used to hate that and I used to critique it so hard. Later on, I started to accept it. And just lean into it because I'm like “okay, the colors are right, the shading is right. It's off, but you can still tell exactly what it is. Just go with this.”Q: What was your process like for giving these artworks titles? How did you think about naming your exhibit, Family Reunion?A: When I look at all these pictures together, it looks to me like a Tyler Perry movie. But also, like a chaotic Tyler Perry movie which is funny. I felt like memes create a familial relationship between people. So many people could not even know what the meme is. But they can all relate to the expression. I know exactly what that is. I know when I felt that way.Q: There are 25 pieces you painted, but we have to ask, which painting was your favorite to produce and why?A: It was a disappearing meme. I just called it ‘Peace’, a fan called peace or discipline. But it's just cool to do this kind of fading away. And that's my favorite because I never painted something that looked opaque before. Like kind of fading away but you can still see it. And I just love the illusion of creating a body through the piece. Q: Can you tell us what your favorite part about this Instagram collaboration was?A: One: the opportunity, absolutely insane to me. Second, the challenge. I enjoy the challenge of pushing myself to the limit of how many things I can do in a set timeframe. If I don't want to work on this right now, I just don't have to work on it, so I can come back to it. I can work on something for months and weeks and years. So I like the challenge. I think that was like my favorite part. The challenge to complete it and make it not look rushed. Make it presentable. Like a challenge to figure out new techniques and new ways to approach things I've already done before to make it easier for me in the future."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/love-at-first-slide-series-black-love-instagram","date":"2022-02-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Design","Product","Announcements"],"title":"Instagram Releases ‘Love at First Slide’ Series Highlighting Black Love that Bloomed on Instagram","text":"In honor of Black History Month, Instagram is unveiling its Love At First Slide Series with eight Black duos. With this content series, we highlight the different forms of Black love that play out on Instagram, whether that be platonic love or romantic love. Through a series of 60-second videos and intimate still images, these duos #ShareBlackStories about how their love blossomed through Instagram. With content produced by Black-founded marketing agency Team Epiphany, the series shines with intimate, warmly-hued glimpses into the people and relationships behind these stories. Take a look at how these duos met and explain what Black love means to them. @telshaanderson + @justinb00ne Justin’s friends thought he’d be interested in Telsha and showed him an Instagram post of her. Justin waited, thinking she was already seeing someone. Days later, Telsha scrolled through her own feed only to stumble upon Justin. What started as a DM inquiry about a T-shirt he posted and designed turned into their first date. Eight months later, the two were engaged and married in fall 2021. @ashtyn_kusher + @ash.angel Ashtyn and Ashley were already following each other on Instagram for years, but Ashley was the first to make contact via Ashtyn’s DMs. While life got in the way, they stayed in touch. One random day, Ashtyn messaged Ashley wondering if she still had a chance. Ashley wrote back with a snarky reply, “You better hurry up before it’s too late,” and the rest was history. They've been engaged since January. @im.arial + @jaconnasalene (Business Partners) Senior Creative at Vice Media Jaconna was already following musician and artist Arial on Instagram for a year. After their loss of their mutual friend, Jaconna reached out to Arial via DM to grieve together. One year later, their friendship blossomed into a business. In honor of their friend, they launched DASOUFGOTSOMETHINGTOSAY, a directory designed for people to easily find Black creatives from the South. They continue to use Instagram to keep up with each other. @theblkguynextdoor + @marcd_johnson Drew was looking on Instagram for a custom suit for an event when he found one of the models — Marcus. Drew followed him on Instagram and began interacting with Marcus’s page by liking and commenting on his posts. When Drew finally DM’d Marcus, it took two months before Marcus connected with him about a career change. Drew helped Marcus negotiate a new position and even a salary increase. As a thank you, Marcus asked Drew on a date. Now, three years later, Drew has relocated to Atlanta and the two continue to thrive. @ryanstoves + @tia.monaee Ryan and Tia met at a college party in Alabama. Ryan spotted Tia, but she was so busy talking to people that he never got a chance to speak to her. A few days later, he found her on Instagram, followed her and liked three pictures. She followed back, liked three of his photos. Ryan slid into Tia’s DMs asking “Are we playing picture tag?” @_blade_brown + @daniava Justin McMullen and Danielle McDowell met in 2013 at a Saturday Morning Cartoons party in Brooklyn. Instead of giving her number, Dani gave Justin her Instagram. For the first month, they only spoke via DMs. Throughout the years, they showcased their relationship on Instagram, creating the hashtag #myheartandhomie. Nine years later, through a cross-country move and career transitions, their friends have watched their relationship grow, all on Instagram. @nicholelynel + @tonythecloser_ Nichole Lynel is a fashion designer and entrepreneur. Tony Robinson Jr. went from being a Seattle Seahawks player to an entrepreneur and real estate/financial expert. They both host the It’s Our Love podcast, where they give a peek into their relationship, including who slid in whose DM’s first. @barack_obutta + @onedopevegan_ (Platonic) Alrick “Butta” Augustine is the founder of Keep It Run Hundred, a nonprofit-run club creating space for wellness and running in Inglewood. Branden Williams was inspired, seeing someone who looked like him making an impact on their community in South Central. After chatting in their Instagram DMs about running, wellness and community, Branden Williams founded One Dope Run Club in San Diego. Butta and Branden have been supporting each other on their respective fitness journeys through Instagram for years. On Branden’s first One Dope Run Club run, Butta surprised him by showing up to run."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shop-live-on-instagram-this-valentines-day","date":"2022-02-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Shop Live on Instagram this Valentine's Day","text":"Celebrate the season of love with Instagram.

At Instagram, we want to share some of the work we've been doing to help people keep themselves and their accounts safer on the platform. Below you’ll learn more about: Top tips on keeping your account safe How to keep your account secure using Security Checkup How to help keep bullying or offensive content off of the platform New tools we’re testing to give you more control over your activity, and how friends can help when you have trouble accessing your account Keeping your account secure Last summer, we introduced Security Checkup for people whose accounts may have been hacked. Now, this feature is available to everyone worldwide. Security Checkup guides people through the steps needed to secure their account including: checking login activity, reviewing profile information, confirming the accounts that share login information and updating account recovery contact information such as a phone number or email address. To complete Security Checkup, go to your Profile and tap the menu in the upper right corner, next tap “Settings”, “Security” then tap “Security Checkup.” To help keep your account secure, ensure you have a strong password and enable two-factor authentication. In certain countries, people now have the option to enable two-factor authentication using WhatsApp. Alternatively, you can enable two-factor authentication using your phone number, or an authenticator app like Duo Mobile or Google Authentication. If you are using an authenticator app, it is now possible for Instagram accounts that are being managed by multiple people to enable two-factor authentication across multiple devices. You can learn more about how to do this in the Instagram Help Center. Managing your Instagram activity At the end of last year, we started testing a new experience for people to see and manage their activity on Instagram in one place. Now this new experience, called “Your activity,” will start rolling out to everyone. People will now be able to bulk manage (delete, archive) their content (posts, stories, videos and Reels) and their interactions (comments, likes, story sticker reactions, etc.) In addition, people will be able to sort and filter their content and interactions by date and search for past comments, likes and stories replies from specific date ranges, all in one place. You can also use this to find content that you’ve recently deleted or archived, check out your search history, see the links you’ve visited and the amount of time you’ve spent on the platform and download your information. To access “Your activity” go to your Profile and tap the menu in the upper right corner, next tap “Your activity”. Leaning on your friend’s help to access your account To help people who have lost access to their accounts, we’re testing a way for people to ask their friends to confirm their identity and regain access to their account. We will have more to share about this feature soon. Finding more information about what’s happening with your content and your reports When you post something that goes against our Community Guidelines it will appear in your Account Status. To access Account Status go to your Profile and tap the menu in the upper right corner, next tap “Settings” then tap “Account” then tap “Account Status.” Here you will be able to see if any of your posts have been removed, and whether your account is at risk of being disabled. If you think we’ve made a mistake, you can appeal by hitting “Request a Review” directly from your Account Status. If you see something that shouldn’t be on Instagram such as bullying or offensive content, you can report it to us. Our teams and systems work 24/7 to quickly review and take action on any content we determine goes against our Community Guidelines. Reporting on Instagram is anonymous (unless related to intellectual property violations), and the person who posted the content will not know you reported it. To learn how to submit a report visit the Instagram Help Center. As always, we only remove content on Instagram when it breaks our rules, not just because it receives multiple reports. When you report something, the report will appear in Support Requests. This feature shows the status of your submitted reports, as well as your report history. To visit Support Requests, go to your Profile and tap the menu in the upper right corner, next tap “Settings” then tap “Support Requests.” From there you can tap any report to see more information about its status. You can also tap “More Options” for suggested actions to take, like muting, blocking, restricting or unfollowing the user whose content you’ve reported. If you disagree with the action we’ve taken on the content you reported, you can tap “Request a Review” to have us take a second look."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-black-history-month-stories-illustrations-2022","date":"2022-02-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Design","Product","Announcements"],"title":"Instagram and Jon Key Create Black History Month Stickers","text":"Instagram’s @Design, dedicated to celebrating the craft and creativity of the design community, is unveiling new global Instagram Stories Illustrations today to mark Black History Month. We’re doing this in collaboration with artist and #BlackDesignVisionaries Impact Grant recipient Jon Key (@jkey13) of Morcos Key (@morcoskey). Key explores Black intersectional identity through four design pillars: Blackness, queerness, southernness and family. His approach resulted in rich Instagram Stories illustrations about Black love and Black joy.@Design sat down with Key to discuss his vision for three new Black History Month illustrated Instagram Stories stickers, his redesign for Instagram’s US-only #ShareBlackStories and #BuyBlack stickers, and a new sticker: #BlackLove.@Design: The audience we are trying to reach with #BlackDesignVisionaries is people who are curious about exploring design as a career. Was there a moment that made you realize that you wanted to be a designer, illustrator and an artist?JK: So that moment happened when I was a sophomore in high school. When I was a sophomore, my friend was applying to SCAD (Savannah College of Art Design) and had a little prospective thing that tells you what majors you can do. I was flipping through this book and I saw graphics, and I was like, “What is graphic design? Like, you can do this? You can go to school for this? Is it a thing that people do?” Nobody had ever really explained to me that that was a career. Literally that moment, I closed the book and ran to the art department, and I was like, “I think I need to be here.” @Design: You're very committed to black and gray. Can you explain a little bit about your reasoning for using black and grey to display people of color? JK: If you think about history, and black-and-white photography, and people holding protest signs — it's not like you're seeing all of these kinds of things. You're seeing one powerful community come together. Regardless of whether they're lighter or darker, they have the same goals. They want liberation, they want freedom. So I think about that a lot with my paintings. I think a lot of these paintings are talking about liberation, talking about freedom, fighting for whatever you’re feeling suppressed by — pushing forward. @Design: As a Black designer, what is something that you always want to get across in your art? What do you hope to get across in these Instagram illustrations?JK: The biggest thing is the nuances and the power of what it is to be a Black person and to be living and thriving, breathing and celebrating, building community and having family — and having chosen family. These illustrations are showing a little bit more of a complicated perspective of Black History Month and Blackness. It's not like this cis, straight, hetero thing that people get left out of. If you think about gay rights in New York City, these are all Black trans women that were leading the way. Even with Black Lives Matter, these are Black women and Black queer women that are leading the way. I'm very happy that queerness is apparent, and that it is being celebrated and supported. @Design: In terms of sharing Black stories, how do you feel about doing the entire redesign?JK: Oh, my God! So that's super exciting. I think it looks very cool. But it's also like, “well, how do people actually use these things?” I really like the typefaces that I’m selecting, one typeface is by Tre Seals of Vocal Type (@vocal.type), which is a Black type designer. That's my job as a designer, right? It's my job as a person that gets opportunities to do things — is bringing other people with me, like them up and to elevate them and amplify their stories and voices, as well, and try to get as many people as many opportunities. I think it's really super fun.I think that people are gonna get it. @Design: Your four core themes are Blackness, Southerness, Queerness and Family. Can you explain why it's important for your art to reflect those themes? JK: When I was an undergrad at RISD, I was really questioning, “What does it mean to be a graphic designer?” I was making work. Nobody was listening. Nobody cared. I was like, “Do I care?” So I started writing and I started asking myself these questions: “What does it mean to be a Black graphic designer? What does it mean to be a graphic designer from Alabama? What does it mean for my family to impact my graphic design work? What does it mean for my queerness?” And really investigating what I care about: “What is my story?” I continued to write and try to visualize and contextualize this writing that I was doing as an undergrad, and the themes that came pretty clear to me are these four pillars that I really care about — these four pillars that really define who I am as a person. So those four pillars are then translated to four colours. Black became blackness, the color black — I love that it takes up colorism. I love that it is really thinking and referencing contemporary painters, but also referencing art’s historical painters as well. Our southerness became green — I grew up in Alabama. I grew up on a farm, it was bucolic, it was very verdant and there were trees everywhere. Family became red — thinking about bloodline, thinking about ancestry, thinking about lineage, and thinking about being reborn. And violet was queerness. I thought about how red and blue are primary colors that are a duality that come together to make purple. But in actuality, violet is its own true colour. It exists in the world outside of that binary. I think about queerness working the same way, existing outside of the binary — being its own true thing. When people ask me to do these types of commissions, I like to use my colors. I like to instill that kind of system and identity within the work. I’m also a graphic designer, so I think visual identities, visual systems — things having conceptual rules that make sense — are a thing that I am bound to, somehow."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/how-we-address-harmful-content-on-feed","date":"2022-01-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Instagram","Announcements","Safety"],"title":"How We Address Potentially Harmful Content on Feed and Stories","text":"Update on August 23, 2022 at 9 AM PT: We’ll now start to show content that may contain adult nudity and sexual themes lower in Feed and Stories, in addition to the content mentioned below. - - -We’ve committed to being more transparent about how Instagram works. As part of that effort, over the past couple of months, we’ve given people more information about features like Search and Ranking. Today, we’re providing an update on changes we’re making to your Instagram Feed. In addition to removing content that goes against our Community Guidelines, we’re now taking stronger action against posts that may contain bullying or hate speech, or that may encourage violence, by showing them lower in Feed and Stories. We will also show potentially upsetting posts lower in your Feed based on your history of reporting content. These changes only impact individual posts, not accounts overall. As always, we only remove posts that break our rules and we tell people if their post has been removed. Addressing Potentially Harmful Content on Feed and Stories At Instagram, we’re always trying to show you content from the accounts you engage with and have the most value to you, while minimizing the likelihood that you come across content that could be upsetting or make you feel unsafe. We’ve always removed content that goes against our Community Guidelines, and use our Recommendations Guidelines to determine the types of content we show in Reels and Explore. Previously, we’ve focused on showing posts lower on Feed and Stories if they contain misinformation as identified by independent fact-checkers, or if they are shared from accounts that have repeatedly shared misinformation in the past. Today, we’re announcing some changes to take this effort even further. If our systems detect that a post may contain bullying, hate speech or may incite violence, we’ll show it lower on Feeds and Stories of that person’s followers. To understand if something may break our rules, we'll look at things like if a caption is similar to a caption that previously broke our rules. We’re constantly improving our systems to be as precise as possible, not only to help remove harmful content from Instagram, but to also make our enforcement as accurate as we can. How Reporting Content Affects Your Feed Your Feed is a collection of posts from the people you follow, ads, and posts we recommend to you. We rank content in your Feed based on how likely we think you are to interact with a post in different ways, like commenting, liking and saving. These signals help us connect you to the content that we think you want to see the most. Now, we’ll also consider how likely we think you are to report a post as one of the signals we use to personalize your Feed. If our systems predict you’re likely to report a post based on your history of reporting content, we will show the post lower in your Feed. You can visit the Instagram Help Center to learn more about how to report content and keep track of your reports. Look out for more updates from us in the weeks to come, as we continue sharing more on how all the different parts of Instagram come together."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-better-previews-of-your-content-outside-of-instagram","date":"2021-12-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Introducing Better Previews of Your Content, Outside of Instagram","text":"Today, we’re announcing several new updates that will improve the ways your content can appear outside of Instagram. We heard your feedback and want to make it easier for you to grow your audience and get discovered by better previewing your content in more places.Image previews will now appear in your Tweet when sharing Instagram posts from public accounts to Twitter. This highlights your content and shows people what they’ll see when they click your link. Our goal is to create a better experience for people who want to see a preview of Instagram content while scrolling on Twitter. How Instagram Previews on Twitter WorkIn order to see a preview of an Instagram post on Twitter, the Instagram account needs to be public, whether it’s your own or someone else’s. If you write a Tweet and include a link to a public Instagram post, an image preview will be shown as a Twitter Card with a thumbnail in the Tweet. If you choose to share to Twitter from Instagram, the caption from the post will appear in addition to the image preview.Clicking the link of the preview on Twitter will bring you directly to the post on Instagram. All types of Feed posts, like Photos, Videos, Carousels and Reels, will preview when shared to Twitter. Stories won’t show up as previews on Twitter for now. More Ways to Discover Your Instagram Content In addition to sharing previews on Twitter, you can also embed your Instagram profile on a website. We’ve enabled posts from public accounts to be embedded on external websites in the past—now, you can share previews of your profile and up to six of your most recent images to encourage people to view more. This will be first available in the United States, and we’ll look to expand to more countries soon. Embeds are great for creators who want to cross-promote on websites outside of Instagram, and for publishers who want better ways to showcase profiles to their readers.To embed an Instagram profile on web: Go to the profile you want to share.If it’s your profile, click the gear icon. If it’s another profile, click the •••.Click “embed,” then “copy embed code.” Copy and paste the code into your website to display a profile preview. We know it’s important for you to be able to control where your Instagram content shows up. You can choose whether your public posts or profile can be embedded on websites outside of Instagram using a new control for embeds, available in settings. This setting will also only be available to people in the United States to start."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-trends-2022","date":"2021-12-12T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","Announcements"],"title":"The 2022 Instagram Trend Report","text":"The first edition of the Instagram Trend Report is here!

Parents and guardians will be able to see how much time their teens spend on Instagram and set time limits. And we’ll have a new educational hub for parents and guardians.Every day I see the positive impact that Instagram has for young people everywhere. I’m proud that our platform is a place where teens can spend time with the people they care about, explore their interests, and explore who they are.I want to make sure that it stays that way, which means above all keeping them safe on Instagram. We’ll continue doing research, consulting with experts, and testing new concepts to better serve teens.Today, I’d like to clarify some of the work that we’ve been doing for a long time, and also lay out a few new things that we’ve been developing to meaningfully improve the experience on Instagram for teens, parents and guardians. This includes developing new tools for parents and guardians and launching Take A Break. Involving parents and guardians in their teens’ experience We’re launching our first tools for parents and guardians early next yearWe’re introducing a new educational hub for parents and guardians Parents and guardians know what's best for their teens, so we plan to launch our first tools in March to help them guide and support their teens on Instagram. Parents and guardians will be able to view how much time their teens spend on Instagram and set time limits. We’ll also give teens a new option to notify their parents if they report someone, giving their parents the opportunity to talk about it with them. This is the first version of these tools; we’ll continue to add more options over time.We’re also developing a new educational hub for parents and guardians that will include additional resources, like product tutorials and tips from experts, to help them discuss social media use with their teens. Providing teens with more tools to better manage their Instagram experienceWe previously announced the development of ‘Take A Break’, and we’re launching it in US, UK, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand and Australia todayWe’re also starting to test a new experience for teens to better manage their digital footprint on InstagramIt’s important to me that people feel good about the time they spend on Instagram, so today we’re launching ‘Take A Break’ to empower people to make informed decisions about how they’re spending their time. If someone has been scrolling for a certain amount of time, we’ll ask them to take a break from Instagram and suggest that they set reminders to take more breaks in the future. We’ll also show them expert-backed tips to help them reflect and reset.To make sure that teens are aware of this feature, we’ll show them notifications suggesting they turn these reminders on. We’re encouraged to see that teens are using Take A Break. Early test results show that once teens set the reminders, more than 90% of them keep them on. We’re launching this feature in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand and Australia today, and we’ll bring it to everyone by early next year.The ‘Take a Break’ reminders build on our existing time management tools including Daily Limit, which lets people know when they’ve reached the total amount of time they want to spend on Instagram each day, and offers the ability to mute notifications from Instagram.We’re encouraged that experts see the value of these features, including Boris Radanović, UK Safer Internet Centre, who said, “We welcome Instagram’s new Take A Break feature, which we hope will be a meaningful way to encourage healthy social media use, particularly among younger users. Whilst taking regular breaks from screens has been challenging recently, it has been good advice for many years, and initiatives that encourage this are to be supported. We will continue to work with Instagram in this regard and hope that this represents a step in the right direction.”Anne Collier at The Net Safety Collaborative, who said, “I love 'Take a Break' because it gives young users better control over their experiences on Instagram. Because we know that agency – the power to make choices and take action – is vital to adolescent wellbeing and mental health”, and Dr. Alfiee M. Breland-Noble, a psychologist and founder of mental health nonprofit the AAKOMA project, who said, “It is imperative that we equip a diverse population of Gen Z and Gen Alpha youth with the necessary coping skills and tech tools to help them effectively manage their social media use. The well-being of diverse teens, including marginalized youth who face a host of unique societal challenges, is an imperative for me. It was therefore my pleasure to contribute my 25+ years of scientific and clinical knowledge to the development of the “Take a Break” feature for Instagram. This feature is one necessary positive tool to support young people's well-being within the context of healthy social media engagement.”We’re also starting to test a new experience for people to see and manage their Instagram activity. We know that as teens grow up, they want more control over how they show up both online and offline so, for the first time, they will be able to bulk delete content they’ve posted like photos and videos, as well as their previous likes and comments. While available to everyone, I think this tool is particularly important for teens to more fully understand what information they've shared on Instagram, what is visible to others, and to have an easier way to manage their digital footprint. This new experience will be available to everyone in January. Developing new features to make Instagram safer for teens We’ll stop people from tagging or mentioning teens that don’t follow themWe’ll be stricter about what we recommend to teens in Search, Explore, Hashtags and Suggested AccountsWe’ll start nudging teens towards different topics if they’ve been dwelling on one topic for a whileEarlier this year, we began defaulting teens into private accounts when they signed up for Instagram, and we stopped adults from being able to DM teens who don’t follow them. Now, we’ll also switch off the ability for people to tag or mention teens who don’t follow them, or to include their content in Reels Remixes or Guides by default when they first join Instagram. We’re testing these changes to further minimize the possibility that teens will hear from those they don’t know, or don’t want to hear from, and plan to make them available to everyone early next year.In July, we launched the Sensitive Content Control, which allows people to decide how much sensitive content shows up in Explore. The control has three options: Allow, Limit and Limit Even More. “Limit” is the default state for everyone and based on our Recommendation Guidelines, “Allow” enables people to see more sensitive content, whereas “Limit Even More” means they see less of this content than the default state. The “Allow” option is unavailable to people under the age of 18.We’re exploring expanding the “Limit Even More” state beyond Explore for teens. This will make it more difficult for teens to come across potentially harmful or sensitive content or accounts in Search, Explore, Hashtags, Reels and Suggested Accounts. We’re in the early stages of this idea and will have more to share in time.Lastly, our research shows — and external experts agree1,2 — that if people are dwelling on one topic for a while, it could be helpful to nudge them towards other topics at the right moment. That’s why we’re building a new experience that will nudge people towards other topics if they’ve been dwelling on one topic for a while. We’ll have more to share on this, and changes we’re making when it comes to content and accounts we recommend to teens, soon.Dr. Phillippa Diedrichs, a Professor of Psychology at the Centre for Appearance Research at the University of West England Bristol, agreed that nudging techniques show promise, saying “over the past eight months, I've been working with the Instagram team to brainstorm ways to help users have a positive experience and avoid social comparisons. Nudges are a behaviour change technique studied by behavioural economists for over a decade. They've been applied successfully to issues like climate change, employee well-being and altruism. More recently, digital nudges have been studied as a way to improve users' experiences online without compromising their freedom and personal choice.” This is just a snapshot of our work. We’re also continuing to develop innovative new solutions to verify people’s ages on Instagram, for example.As always, I’m grateful to the experts and researchers who lend us their expertise in critical areas like child development, teen mental health and online safety, and I continue to welcome productive collaboration with lawmakers and policymakers on our shared goal of creating an online world that both benefits and protects many generations to come.- - -1Purohit, Aditya & Barclay, Louis & Holzer, Adrian.

The grant recipients were chosen from more than 500 applications by a prestigious committee led by writer and curator Antwaun Sargent and including Ruth E. Carter, Justina Blakeney, Toni L. Griffin, Sarah Elizabeth Lewis, Rick Lowe, Bobby C. Martin Jr, Heron Preston, Ian Spalter and Asad Syrkett.“I'm overwhelmed by the quality of submissions and the ways in which these designers are thinking about the world. A grant like this could mean limitless possibilities, providing an opportunity to those who do not have access to traditional pathways into spaces such as art and design. We all live in this world, we all have to navigate this world. When we have those different perspectives, we all benefit.”- Antwaun Sargent, grant committee leadThe Grant RecipientsVisionary Small Business Grant:Head of State (@headofstate_)Fashion design house Photo: Elias Williams; Digital Art: Temi Coker Multidisciplinary artist and designer Taofeek Abijako founded Head of State in 2016, at the age of 17. Three years later, he became the youngest designer to show at New York Fashion Week (Men’s) and debuted his first womenswear collection, ‘Homecoming’ in September 2021. Inspired by Abijako’s Nigerian roots, HOS represents postcolonial youth culture today — a diverse space impacted by Western influences. HOS donates a portion of its proceeds to initiatives that help build more sustainable futures for underserved communities.“One of the things we loved about Head of State is how they use design in a number of different ways. There's the design of artifacts — the fashion and the clothing itself. And there's the narrative around what the aesthetic of the fashion means. The other is the way in which the artist designs a creative ecosystem: how the economy of fashion can have an impact on addressing issues of social and spatial justice – especially economic equity and representation.” - Toni L. GriffinImpact Grant:Morcos Key (@morcoskey)Graphic design studio Photo: Elias Williams; Digital Art: Temi Coker Morcos Key, a graphic design studio founded by Jon Key and Wael Morcos, collaborates with arts and cultural institutions, nonprofits and commercial enterprises. The studio prioritizes advocating for underrepresented groups, creating visual systems that present complex historical narratives with contemporary urgency. They have worked with organizations including the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; the Studio Museum in Harlem; MoMA; Nike; and the Sharjah Triennial; as well as publications such as The New Yorker, The Atlantic and The New York Times.“The work Morcos Key is doing is groundbreaking — focusing on subject matter crucial to the future of Black culture, while also advocating for greater rights and representation for the LGBTQIA community. In the visual design field, Black voices are often overlooked, so the work that Morcos Key is doing can feel like pushing a boulder uphill. They've shown us the beginning of something really special. A grant like this could help propel them into a space of greater freedom and give them the opportunity to really make a difference.” - Bobby C. MartinAspiring Designer Grant:Dominique Petit-Frère (@limboaccra)Spatial designer Photo: Carlos Idun-Tawiah; Digital Art: Temi Coker Dominique Petit-Frère is the Founder & Vision Director of Limbo Accra, a collaborative spatial design studio dedicated to architectural projects, art installations and urban design. Petit-Frère imagines a future that is young, inclusive and regenerative, using urban design as a form of spatial justice that can bridge the gaps between communities and create socio-economic change. At a time when many African cities are experiencing rapid urbanization, Limbo Accra explores the significance of abandoned, incomplete concrete buildings, revitalizing and repurposing these sites. Limbo Accra was recently appointed architectural lead for Ghana’s first-ever recreational skate park, which will be their first built project.“Dominique Petit-Frère’s interdisciplinary approach to spatial justice is groundbreaking, and I love how she uses art and design to create conversations around sustainability and collaborative community-led development. I am so excited to be a small part of celebrating her and her work and to see how this grant will help support the growth of her mission, projects and studio.” - Justina BlakeneyAspiring Designer Grant:Tré Seals (@vocaltype.co)Type designer Photo: Jared Soares; Digital Art: Temi Coker Tré Seals founded Vocal Type, a diversity-driven type foundry, to confront the lack of diversity in the graphic design industry. Each typeface Seals develops is designed to highlight a historical moment — from the women's suffrage movement in Argentina to the civil rights movement in the U.S. Since 2016, Seals’s fonts have traveled around the world, taking the form of street murals, protest signs, voting materials and brand campaigns.“Vocal Type Co. founder Tré Seals learned that only 3 to 5 percent of practicing designers in America are Black and took it as a call to action. His innovative designs \"Trojan Horse-in\" underrepresented cultures. For example, if his new typeface, ‘Martin’ looks a little familiar, it’s because it was inspired by the placards at the Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike of 1968. His ‘Broome’ typeface honors the design aesthetic of the first Black-owned record label in the United States. Every type has a story. His ‘Du Bois’ typeface was inspired by W.E.B. Du Bois's bold, innovative infographics diagramming Black American life. This powerful marriage of innovation and history is a way for Seals to herald the significance of the cultural events that have designed our society.” - Sarah Elizabeth LewisAspiring Designer Grant:Sablā Stays (@callmesabla)Designer and art director Photo: Elias Williams; Digital Art: Temi Coker Sablā Stays is a multidisciplinary designer and art director whose practice seeks to channel the multidimensionality of the Black collective experience through image and design. She aims to showcase people and subjects that live within the shadow of mainstream culture, using storytelling and design as a tool to educate and challenge narrow perspectives.“I was immediately impressed by Sablā’s intelligent work in graphic design and art direction, in which she combines photography, type and visual ephemera in a language informed by the internet and Black-American cultural artifacts. Sablā’s work — most recently for Solange Knowles's Saint Heron — has a rigorous, almost analytical sensibility. I'm so excited to see how her talent develops.” - Asad Syrkett"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-celebrates-british-gen-z-self-exploration","date":"2021-11-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","Design","Announcements"],"title":"Instagram Celebrates British Gen Z Self Exploration","text":"As part of our global Yours To Make platform, Instagram is opening an exhibition at Saatchi Gallery London in collaboration with studio HERVISIONS from November 4th to 9th.

Over the years, businesses, creators and change-makers have shown how sharing resources and information can inspire their communities. From organizing and educating around equity, social justice and mental well-being to showcasing new product drops to customers, link sharing is helpful in many ways — so now we're giving access to everyone. Equity, Expression and EnablementWhen we first introduced Stories links, the feature was limited to verified accounts or those with a certain number of followers. We’ve heard from the rest of our community that they also want to share things that matter with their friends and family. Whatever you’re into, from cooking to volunteering or shopping, you now have a space to share in Stories — regardless of your account size.We continue to be inspired by the change-makers on our platform and those who want to turn their passion into a living by sharing links. We recently introduced new ways for creators and businesses to reach more fans, engage their community and grow their reach, and we aim to further support them with access to links.How to Add Links to Your StoriesUse the Link sticker to add a link to your Instagram story.

We have a number of tools in place to help people keep their Instagram accounts safe against phishing attacks and suspicious activity - and we’re always working to improve and update these security features to ensure that we remain a safe and welcoming community.From Security Checkup to reporting tools, we’ve rounded up five key steps for everyone to help keep their account secure:Security Checkup: A new feature to help people keep their Instagram accounts secure. Security Checkup will guide people, whose accounts may have been hacked, through the steps needed to secure them. This includes checking login activity, reviewing profile information, confirming the accounts that share login information and updating account recovery contact information such as phone number or email.Enable two-factor authentication: We strongly recommend setting up two-factor authentication, which is a security feature that helps protect your Instagram account and your password. Having two-factor authentication means you’ll receive a notification or be asked to enter a special login code when someone tries logging into your account from a device we don't recognize. Head to Security in your Settings and set this up in just a few taps, either using your phone number, or an authenticator app like Duo Mobile or Google Authentication. Enable Login Request: When you set up two-factor authentication on Instagram, you’ll receive an alert whenever someone tries to log in to your account from a device or web browser we don't recognize. These alerts will tell you which device tried logging in and where it's located. You can approve or deny the request immediately from your already logged in devices. You can also view the list of devices that have recently logged into your Instagram account at any time under “Settings,” “Security,” “Login Activity.” If you don’t recognize a recent login, you can log out of that location or device and let us know that the login wasn’t you.Update your phone number and email: Make sure that the email and phone numbers associated with your device are up to date. That way if something happens to your account, we can reach you. These steps let you recover your account even if your info has been changed by a hacker.Instagram will never send you a DM: Over the past few months, we’ve seen a rise in malicious accounts DMing people to try and access sensitive information like account passwords. They may tell you that your account is at risk of being banned, that you are violating our policies around intellectual property, or that your photos are being shared elsewhere. These messages are often scams and violate our policies. When we discover these kinds of scams, we take action against them, but we also encourage you to report the content and block the account. Remember: Instagram will never send you a DM. If Instagram ever wants to reach you about your account, we will do so via the ‘Emails from Instagram’ tab in your settings, which is the only place you will find direct and authentic communication from us on the app.Report content and accounts you find questionable: While we are always improving our technology to combat new trends and techniques that hackers and spammy accounts may use, you can also report individual pieces of content to us by tapping the three dots above a post, holding on a message, or by visiting an account and reporting directly from the profile.

This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.Kids are already onlineCritics of “Instagram Kids” will see this as an acknowledgement that the project is a bad idea. That’s not the case. The reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.We’re not the only company to think so. Our peers recognized these issues and built experiences for kids. YouTube and TikTok have versions of their app for those under 13. Our intention is not for this version to be the same as Instagram today. It was never meant for younger kids, but for tweens (aged 10-12). It will require parental permission to join, it won’t have ads, and it will have age-appropriate content and features. Parents can supervise the time their children spend on the app and oversee who can message them, who can follow them and who they can follow. The list goes on. Building parental supervision toolsAn important part of what we’ve been developing for “Instagram Kids” is a way for parents to supervise their child’s use of Instagram. While we’re pausing our development of “Instagram Kids”, we’ll continue our work to allow parents to oversee their children’s accounts by expanding these tools to teen accounts (aged 13 and over) on Instagram. These new features, which parents and teens can opt into, will give parents the tools to meaningfully shape their teen's experience. We’ll have more to share on this in the coming months.Continuing our focus on teen safetyRecent reporting from the WSJ on our research into teen’s experiences on Instagram has raised a lot of questions for people. To be clear, I don’t agree with how the Journal has reported on our research. My colleague Pratiti goes into this more here.We do research like this so we can make Instagram better. That means our insights often shed light on problems, but they inspire new ideas and changes to Instagram. Examples include our industry leading anti-bullying work such as Restrict, Hidden Words, and Limits, and our recent changes to make Instagram accounts private by default for those under 16.Research also informs our work on issues like negative body image. We announced last week that we’re exploring two new ideas: encouraging people to look at other topics if they’re dwelling on content that might contribute to negative social comparison, and a feature tentatively called “Take a Break,” where people could put their account on pause and take a moment to consider whether the time they’re spending is meaningful. I have three children and their safety is the most important thing in my life. I hear the concerns with this project, and we’re announcing these steps today so we can get it right."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/yours-to-make-brand-platform","date":"2021-09-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"The Next Chapter in Instagram's Brand Story","text":"Today, Instagram is launching a new global brand platform: “Yours To Make.” Yours to Make showcases how you can explore who you are with Instagram.

While the story focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light, we stand by this research. It demonstrates our commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues young people may struggle with, and informs all the work we do to help those experiencing these issues. The question on many people’s minds is if social media is good or bad for people. The research on this is mixed; it can be both. At Instagram, we look at the benefits and the risks of what we do. We’re proud that our app can give voice to those who have been marginalized, that it can help friends and families stay connected from all corners of the world, that it can prompt societal change; but we also know it can be a place where people have negative experiences, as the Journal called out today. Our job is to make sure people feel good about the experience they have on Instagram, and achieving that is something we care a great deal about.The research in contextThe internet has drastically increased how many people we all connect to, and how much information we consume. As a society, we’re working out how to process these changes, and what’s right for each of us individually. At Instagram, we hire the best researchers and scientists we can to look at these changes, and to help us understand how they impact people. We also consult with leading experts and researchers around the world to help us see beyond our own work.External research into the impact social media has on people is still relatively nascent and evolving, and social media itself is changing rapidly. Some researchers argue that we need more evidence to understand social media's impact on people. Each study has limitations and caveats, so no single study is going to be conclusive. We need to rely on an ever-growing body of multi-method research and expert input.Our findingsThe research on the effects of social media on people’s well-being is mixed, and our own research mirrors external research. Social media isn’t inherently good or bad for people. Many find it helpful one day, and problematic the next. What seems to matter most is how people use social media, and their state of mind when they use it.A mixed methods study from Harvard described the “see-saw” of positive and negative experiences that US teens have on social media. The same person may have an important conversation with their friend on one day, and fall out with them the next day. According to research by Pew Internet on teens in the US, 81% of teens said that social media makes them feel more connected to their friends, while 26% reported social media makes them feel worse about their lives.Our findings were similar. Many said Instagram makes things better or has no effect, but some, particularly those who were already feeling down, said Instagram may make things worse. In the research world, this isn’t surprising or unexpected. Issues like negative social comparison and anxiety exist in the world, so they’re going to exist on social media too. That doesn’t change the fact that we take these findings seriously, and we set up a specific effort to respond to this research and change Instagram for the better.What we’re doingWe’ve done extensive work around bullying, suicide and self-injury, and eating disorders, to help make Instagram a safe and supportive place for everyone. Based on our research and feedback from experts, we’ve developed features so people can protect themselves from bullying, we’ve given everyone the option to hide like counts, and we’ve continued to connect people who may be struggling with local support organisations.We’re increasingly focused on addressing negative social comparison and negative body image. One idea we think has promise is finding opportunities to jump in if we see people dwelling on certain types of content. From our research, we’re starting to understand the types of content some people feel may contribute to negative social comparison, and we’re exploring ways to prompt them to look at different topics if they’re repeatedly looking at this type of content. We’re cautiously optimistic that these nudges will help point people towards content that inspires and uplifts them, and to a larger extent, will shift the part of Instagram’s culture that focuses on how people look. We also want to be more transparent about the research we do, both internally and in collaboration with external researchers. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to work with more partners to publish independent studies in this area, and we’re working through how we can allow external researchers more access to our data in a way that respects people’s privacy. We’ll have more to share on our research, and new features we’re building, soon."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/understanding-verification-on-instagram","date":"2021-09-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Understanding Verification on Instagram","text":"Over the last few months, we’ve made some updates to improve the verification application process on Instagram and Facebook. Here’s more info about what’s changed, what you should keep in mind when applying for verification, plus some other answers to frequently asked questions. What is verification? At its core, verification is a way for people to know that the notable accounts they are following or searching for are exactly who they say they are. It’s a way for people to know which accounts are authentic and notable. Verification badges aren’t an endorsement from us, nor do we consider them a symbol of importance. As a part of our ongoing equity work, we revisited our verification process and found that some people were uncertain about the purpose of verification, how accounts get verified and whether verification affects how an account is treated on Instagram and Facebook. Over the last few months, we’ve made it a bit easier for people to request verification by updating the form you see in the app. We made updates so people can better understand what needs to be submitted for verification, and to offer more transparency on our requirements. These requirements are consistent across Facebook and Instagram. How do I get verified?To be verified, you must follow our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines. In the application process (available directly in the app) we require the following things: Your account must represent a real person, registered business or entity. Your account must be the unique presence of the person or business it represents. Notable entities (for example pets or publications) are also eligible. Only one account per person or business may be verified, with exceptions for language-specific accounts. Your account must be public and have a bio, profile photo and at least one post. Your account must represent a well-known, highly searched-for person, brand or entity. We verify accounts that are featured in multiple news sources. We don't consider paid or promotional content as news sources. Across Instagram and Facebook, we recently expanded our list of news sources to include more diverse outlets including those from additional Black, LGBTQ+, Latinx media, and including more outlets from around the world for example. With the updates we’ve made, people can also now share information about their audience, the region they're most popular in, and add up to five news articles to help our teams have more context when reviewing the applications.What does verification mean and NOT mean?Simply put, verification signals authenticity and notability. It’s not an endorsement from us, and being verified doesn’t mean that your content is favored by our systems in terms of where your content shows up. We try to ensure impartiality in the verification application process by relying on sources such as credible press coverage and examining the person’s cultural impact. For example: are they currently a big part of what people in their community are talking about? Have they recently gone viral?Unfortunately, we know verified accounts can present a security risk for account holders. Hackers may attempt to take control of a verified account to sell the badge (as well as the hard-earned following). We highly recommend that verified accounts have two-factor authentication set up for protection from hacking and to be mindful of scams and impersonation attempts.Can I transfer my verification badge over to another account?Verified accounts can’t change the account’s name or transfer that verification onto a different account. The purpose of the blue badge is for people to know that the account has been vetted and we have confirmed that they are who they say they are.What happens when we detect a suspicious or malicious verification?If we find that verification was acquired in a malicious way, or that an individual is selling verified accounts to others, we will take action. We conduct regular sweeps both on and off the platform to find and remove malicious actors from Instagram. Learn more about Instagram’s Community Guidelines here.We’re always making changes to improve everyone’s experience on Instagram and Facebook, and we hope this post helps explain how things work when it comes to verification.

To do that we need to know how old everybody is on Instagram, so we’ve started asking people to share their birthday with us if they haven’t shared it previously. This information allows us to create new safety features for young people, and helps ensure we provide the right experiences to the right age group. Recent examples include changes we made in March to prevent adults from sending messages to people under 18 who don’t follow them, and last month we started to default new accounts belonging to people under the age of 16 into a private setting. This information also allows us to personalize your experience, for example, we can apply recent changes we made to restrict advertiser targeting options for audiences under the age of 18, to more people. It also helps us show you more relevant ads. This work began a few years ago when we started asking people for their birthday. While we have birthdays for most people on Instagram, to get a more complete picture we're introducing two new changes. These changes only apply to people who haven’t already shared their birthday. First, we’ll start to ask you for your birthday when you open Instagram. We’ll show you a notification a handful of times and if you haven’t provided us with your birthday by a certain point, you’ll need to share it to continue using Instagram. This information is necessary for new features we’re developing to protect young people. Second, if you see warning screens placed on posts, we’ll ask you for your birthday before you can see the post. These screens aren’t new, and we already show them on posts that may be sensitive or graphic, but we don’t currently ask for your birthday when viewing these posts. Now, we’ll start asking for your birthday on some of these screens if you haven’t shared it with us previously. We recognize some people may give us the wrong birthday, and we’re developing new systems to address this. As we shared recently, we’re using artificial intelligence to estimate how old people are based on things like “Happy Birthday” posts. In the future, if someone tells us they’re above a certain age, and our technology tells us otherwise, we’ll show them a menu of options to verify their age. This work is still in the early stages, and we look forward to sharing more soon. We hope this explains why we’re starting to ask some people for their birthday, and why it is so important for our efforts to provide safer, more private experiences for young people.

There are two months in the calendar year that feel ripe for personal reinvention. January is the obvious one. But this late August/early September time—ingrained in us all for 12+ years as the start of a new school year—has just as many “fresh start” vibes. This year, so many of us are hungry to start a new chapter. (I say this as someone who optimistically bought her “back to the office” dress in early June.) Our fresh start this year is most certainly grounded in the awareness of the impact of the continuing global pandemic. This year’s fall trends reflect the past 18 months with an increased respect for nature and art, self-identity and pageantry. A year of long walks and hikes can be seen in the evolving Gorpcore aesthetic. The added appreciation for all things simply joyful (a trend we’re calling “C’Mon Get Happy”) is reflected in the bright colors and bold patterns in everything from tops to nails to dishware. And, with the arrival of fashion month—kicked off by the Met Gala on September 13—the vitality of design as a tool of expression will be fully on display.

From nail art to interior design to dinner recipes, Search is a place for discovery and inspiration. In Shedding More Light on How Instagram Works, we shared how we personalize your experience across Feed, Stories, Reels and Explore. Today, we’re breaking down what you see when you search and why. How we rank Search resultsSearch is built to help you find accounts and topics of interest. It's different from Feed, Stories, Reels and Explore because your input helps us figure out what to show you. Your search tells us what you’re looking for, and it’s noticeable when the results aren’t useful. It’s important for us to get this right, so we try to organize search results by what’s most relevant to you — whether it be a close friend, a creator you love, or ideas for vegan desserts.Let’s say you’re interested in finding pictures of space after seeing the blue moon. When you tap the search bar on the Explore page, the first thing you see is your recent searches. As you begin typing “space,” we show you accounts, audio, hashtags, and places that match the text of your search. In this case, results like @space and #space show up because “space” appears in their name. In addition to the text you type into search, we use information from accounts, hashtags and places — called signals — to rank your search results. The most important signals we use, in order of importance, are: Your text in Search. The text you enter in the search bar is by far the most important signal for Search. We try to match what you type with relevant usernames, bios, captions, hashtags and places. Your activity. This includes accounts you follow, posts you've viewed, and how you've interacted with accounts in the past. We usually show accounts and hashtags you follow or visit higher than those you don’t. Information about the search results. When there are a lot of potential results, we also look at popularity signals. These include the number of clicks, likes, shares and follows for a particular account, hashtag or place.How we help you show up in Search We understand that it’s important you show up in search results when friends or fans are looking for you. We want to make sure that it’s easy for others to find your photos and videos, so here are a few best practices that you can use to help show up in search results:Use a fitting handle and profile name. Search results are matched by text. Using an Instagram handle or profile name that’s related to the content of your posts is your best bet for showing up in relevant searches. If your friends or fans know you by a certain name, include that name in your username or profile so that you can show up when they search for you.Include relevant keywords and locations in your bio. Same principle here. Make sure your bio includes keywords about who you are and what your profile is about. If your account is location-specific, like for a small business, sharing your location in your bio can make it easier for people in your area to find you.Use relevant keywords and hashtags in captions. For a post to be found in Search, put keywords and hashtags in the caption, not the comments.How we help keep Search safeWe avoid showing you accounts, posts and hashtags that go against our Recommendations Guidelines in search results. We do this in a few ways. Accounts that post spam or violate our guidelines may appear lower in search results, and you may have to search their full username to find them. We also balance searches for sensitive topics with additional safety measures to make sure we don’t show you related content that could be harmful. Accounts, hashtags and posts that violate our Community Guidelines are removed from Instagram entirely, which prevents them from showing up in Search.We will continue to make search safer with features like information pop-ups for sensitive searches. These pages provide links to verified resources for additional support.How we plan to make Search even better Search was originally created to help you navigate Instagram. We are soon launching a series of improvements designed for inspiration and discovery. These changes make Instagram Search more than just a way to find accounts and hashtags. We’re moving towards a full search results page experience that makes it even easier to go deep on your interests.The keywords you can use to search for content is expanding. We’re currently focused on getting keyword search results right in English, and will add support for other languages in the future.We’re also making search results better for exploration. For example, your search for “space” will show you space-related photos and videos, too. This is especially helpful when you don’t have an exact username or hashtag in mind when searching for a certain topic. We design all of our features to help you find the things you love. We are constantly working on improvements to help you discover entertaining things to share with your friends, and we look forward to showing you more about how Instagram works in upcoming posts."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/creators-challenging-the-status-quo","date":"2021-08-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements","Instagram"],"title":"Creators Challenging the Status Quo","text":"After a year that challenged everything we thought was normal and possible, a new campaign from Instagram denounces “going back to normal” because normal was never good enough.

We have a responsibility to make sure everyone feels safe when they come to Instagram. We don’t allow hate speech or bullying on Instagram, and we remove it whenever we find it. We also want to protect people from having to experience this abuse in the first place, which is why we’re constantly listening to feedback from experts and our community, and developing new features to give people more control over their experience on Instagram, and help protect them from abuse. Limits: Easily preventing unwanted comments and DMs To help protect people when they experience or anticipate a rush of abusive comments and DMs, we’re introducing Limits: a feature that’s easy to turn on, and will automatically hide comments and DM requests from people who don’t follow you, or who only recently followed you. We developed this feature because we heard that creators and public figures sometimes experience sudden spikes of comments and DM requests from people they don’t know. In many cases this is an outpouring of support — like if they go viral after winning an Olympic medal. But sometimes it can also mean an influx of unwanted comments or messages. Now, if you’re going through that — or think you may be about to — you can turn on Limits and avoid it. Our research shows that a lot of negativity towards public figures comes from people who don’t actually follow them, or who have only recently followed them, and who simply pile on in the moment. We saw this after the recent Euro 2020 final, which resulted in a significant - and unacceptable - spike in racist abuse towards players. Creators also tell us they don’t want to switch off comments and messages completely; they still want to hear from their community and build those relationships. Limits allows you to hear from your long-standing followers, while limiting contact from people who might only be coming to your account to target you. Limits will be available to everyone on Instagram globally from today. Go to your privacy settings to turn it on, or off, whenever you want. We’re also exploring ways to detect when you may be experiencing a spike in comments and DMs, so we can prompt you to turn on Limits. Stronger warnings to discourage harassment We already show a warning when someone tries to post a potentially offensive comment. And if they try to post potentially offensive comments multiple times, we show an even stronger warning - reminding them of our Community Guidelines and warning them that we may remove or hide their comment if they proceed. Now, rather than waiting for the second or third comment, we’ll show this stronger message the first time. We’ve found these warnings really discourage people from posting something hurtful. For example, in the last week we showed warnings about a million times per day on average to people when they were making comments that were potentially offensive. Of these, about 50% of the time the comment was edited or deleted by the user based on these warnings. Combatting abuse in DMs and comments To help protect people from abuse in their DM requests, we recently announced Hidden Words, which allows you to automatically filter offensive words, phrases and emojis into a Hidden Folder, that you never have to open if you don’t want to. It also filters DM requests that are likely to be spammy or low-quality. We launched this feature in a handful of countries earlier this year, and it will be available for everyone globally by the end of this month. We’ll continue to encourage accounts with large followings to use it, with messages both in their DM inbox and at the front of their Stories tray. We’ve expanded the list of potentially offensive words, hashtags and emojis that we automatically filter out of comments, and will continue updating it frequently. We recently added a new opt-in option to “Hide More Comments” that may be potentially harmful, even if they may not break our rules. Continuing the fight against online abuse We hope these new features will better protect people from seeing abusive content, whether it’s racist, sexist, homophobic or any other type of abuse. We know there’s more to do, including improving our systems to find and remove abusive content more quickly, and holding those who post it accountable. We also know that, while we’re committed to doing everything we can to fight hate on our platform, these problems are bigger than us. We will continue to invest in organisations focused on racial justice and equity, and look forward to further partnership with industry, governments and NGOs to educate and help root out hate. This work remains unfinished, and we’ll continue to share updates on our progress."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-young-people-a-safer-more-private-experience","date":"2021-07-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements","Safety"],"title":"Giving Young People a Safer, More Private Experience","text":"[Update on December 10, 2021 at 6PM PT: Our change to default teens into private accounts when they join Instagram will take effect on the web version and IG Lite over the next several weeks.] Creating an experience on Instagram that’s safe and private for young people, but also fun comes with competing challenges. We want them to easily make new friends and keep up with their family, but we don’t want them to deal with unwanted DMs or comments from strangers. We think private accounts are the right choice for young people, but we recognize some young creators might want to have public accounts to build a following. We want to strike the right balance of giving young people all the things they love about Instagram while also keeping them safe. That’s why we’re announcing changes we’ll make today, including: Defaulting young people into private accounts.Making it harder for potentially suspicious accounts to find young people. Limiting the options advertisers have to reach young people with ads.Defaulting people under 16 into private accountsWherever we can, we want to stop young people from hearing from adults they don’t know, or that they don’t want to hear from. We believe private accounts are the best way to prevent this from happening. So starting this week, everyone who is under 16 years old (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into a private account when they join Instagram.Private accounts let people control who sees or responds to their content. If you have a private account, people have to follow you to see your posts, Stories and Reels unless you choose to allow others to reshare your content. People also can’t comment on your content in those places, and they won’t see your content at all in places like Explore or hashtags.Historically, we asked young people to choose between a public account or a private account when they signed up for Instagram, but our recent research showed that they appreciate a more private experience. During testing, eight out of ten young people accepted the private default settings during sign-up. For young people who already have a public account on Instagram, we’ll show them a notification highlighting the benefits of a private account and explaining how to change their privacy settings. We’ll still give young people the choice to switch to a public account or keep their current account public if they wish."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-sensitive-content-control","date":"2021-07-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements","Instagram"],"title":"Introducing Sensitive Content Control","text":"Something has become increasingly clear over the years - people have very different views about the experience we offer, and if it’s the right one for them. We believe people should be able to shape Instagram into the experience that they want. We’ve started to move in this direction with tools like the ability to turn off comments, or Restrict someone from interacting with you on Instagram. Today we’re taking another step and launching what we call “Sensitive Content Control,” which allows you to decide how much sensitive content shows up in Explore. We’ve always had rules about what kind of content can be on Instagram, which we call Community Guidelines, and the point of these guidelines is to keep people safe. We don’t allow hate speech, bullying, and other content that might present a risk of harm to people. We also have rules about what kind of content we show you in places like Explore; we call these our Recommendation Guidelines. These guidelines were designed to help ensure that we don’t show you sensitive content from accounts you don’t follow. You can think of sensitive content as posts that don’t necessarily break our rules, but could potentially be upsetting to some people – such as posts that may be sexually suggestive or violent. This new feature gives you control over sensitive content. You can decide to leave things as they are, assuming you’re satisfied with your experience today, or you can adjust the Sensitive Content Control to see more or less of some types of sensitive content. We recognize that everybody has different preferences for what they want to see on Explore, and this control will give people more choice over what they see. To view your Sensitive Content Control, go to your profile, tap the Settings menu in the upper right corner, tap Account, then tap Sensitive Content Control. Here you can decide whether to keep the setting at its default state (“Standard”) or to see more (“More”) or less of some types of sensitive content (“Less”). You can change your selection at any time. One exception to this: the “Allow” option will not be available to people under 18. Our hope is that this gives you more choice, another way to make Instagram work better for you.

Security Checkup will guide people, whose accounts may have been hacked, through the steps needed to secure them. This includes checking login activity, reviewing profile information, confirming the accounts that share login information and updating account recovery contact information such as phone number or email. Security Checkup is another way that we are working to keep Instagram accounts as secure as we can. But there are several other steps that we recommend everyone also take to make their account even more secure: Enable two-factor authentication – We strongly recommend enabling two-factor authentication. If you’re using WhatsApp, in the coming weeks you will be able to protect your account using your WhatsApp number in certain countries. Alternatively, you can enable two-factor using your phone number, or an authenticator app like Duo Mobile or Google Authentication. For more info visit our Help Center here. Update your phone number and email – Make sure that the email and phone numbers associated with your device are up to date. That way if something happens to your account, we can reach you. These steps let you recover your account even if your info has been changed by a hacker. For more info visit our Help Center here. Instagram will never send you a DM – Over the past few months, we’ve seen a rise in malicious accounts DMing people to try and access sensitive information like account passwords. They may tell you that your account is at risk of being banned, that you are violating our policies around intellectual property, or that your photos are being shared elsewhere. These messages are often scams and violate our policies. Instagram will never send you a DM. When we discover these kinds of scams, we take action against them. But we also encourage you to report the content and block the account. We’ve sent notices at the top of people’s Inbox to warn them about these messages over the past 2 months. If Instagram ever wants to reach you about your account, we will do so via the ‘Emails from Instagram’ tab in your settings, which is the only place you will find direct and authentic communication from us on the app. For more info visit our Help Center here. Report content and accounts you find questionable – While we are always improving our technology to combat new trends and techniques that hackers and spammy accounts may use, you can also report individual pieces of content to us by tapping the three dots above a post, holding on a message, or by visiting an account and reporting directly from the profile. For more info visit our Help Center here. Enable Login Request – When you set up two-factor authentication on Instagram you’ll receive an alert whenever someone tries to log in to your account from a device or web browser we don't recognize. These alerts will tell you which device tried logging in and where it's located. You can approve or deny the request immediately from your already logged in devices. You can also view the list of devices that have recently logged into your Instagram account at any time under “Settings,” “Security,” “Login Activity.” If you don’t recognize a recent login, you can log out of that location or device and let us know that the login wasn’t you. For more info visit our Help Center here. Accounts that impersonate others, use their verification status to hack and target people, or generally conduct spammy behavior with the hopes of misleading people on Instagram break our rules. We are constantly improving our technology to find and stop this behaviour. We’ve also made significant updates to our Support Inbox, so you can find out the latest information about what’s happening with your reports, or find out if any of your posts are violating our policies. This includes being able to easily see the status of everything you’ve ever reported on Instagram, see what posts of yours may have broken our rules, and how to appeal those decisions. From there you can find much more information on the status of what you’ve reported to us.

Whether they are just starting out or are further along in building their business – we want to support creators and give them ways to accomplish their goals. We have a strong foundation in place. Today, creators can use our platforms to partner with brands, sell their own merchandise, earn money from their supporters and earn a portion of revenue from ads that run against their video content. While we’re proud of the progress we’ve made, we know we’ve only just scratched the surface and there’s more we can do to support creators around the world. Today we’re announcing new ways to help creators make a living as they build their personal brands across our platforms. Introducing Affiliate & New Shops Features on Instagram Creators have always used Instagram to share products they love, and people trust their favorite accounts for inspiration and new products. Today, select creators can tag products from the brands they work with or use Shops if they have their own product line. We want to give more creators access to our shopping tools and allow them to get rewarded for the purchases they drive. In the coming months, we’ll begin testing a native affiliate tool that will allow creators to discover new products available on checkout, share them with their followers and earn commissions for the purchases they drive — all within the Instagram app. When people come across an affiliate post from a creator featuring a tagged product, they will see “eligible for commission” at the top of the post, so it’s clear that their purchases help support that creator. This will make it easier for people to shop directly from the creators they love and give brands a new way to partner with and reward creators who share their products. Affiliate will test with a small group of US-based creators and businesses including Benefit, Kopari, MAC, Pat McGrath Labs and Sephora, and will expand to more partners in the future. For creators who want to sell their own merchandise, we're making it easier to add an existing shop or open a new shop on their Instagram profile. For creators who already have their own product lines, they can now link their shop to their personal profile in addition to their business profile. This allows them to display and sell their products directly to fans. The ability to link a shop to a personal profile will be available globally starting today. Creators will also be able to set up a new shop and drive excitement with exclusive product launches from the Instagram app by linking their account with one of our four merchandise partners: Bravado/UMG, Fanjoy, Represent, and Spring. This will roll out to all eligible creators in the US by end of the year. Stay up to date on new shopping features for creators here. “One great side of Instagram is the ability to stay connected with people across the globe and cultivate what feels like a tight-knit community. And now, with the addition of my shop on my profile, fans can seamlessly browse all the fun little things I’m constantly dreaming up right there on the app.”Kacey Musgraves More ways to earn from Badges and Stars Badges on Instagram Live and Stars on Facebook give creators ways to earn from their supporters. We have continued to add improvements to these features to unlock more earning potential, such as adding the ability for supporters to purchase multiple badges during an Instagram livestream, testing the ability for fans to send Stars during recorded content and expanding Stars to nine new markets. As we see more and more creators use these tools to engage directly with their fans, we want to reward them for the impact they’re bringing to our communities. That’s why we’re launching ways for creators to make extra money for hitting certain milestones with badges and Stars. Starting this week, creators on Instagram are eligible to earn an extra payout when they meet certain milestones while using badges in Live, such as going Live with another account.Today Facebook is launching Stars Challenges. Creators in the program can earn payouts from Facebook in the form of free Stars if they meet certain milestones, such as broadcasting a certain number of hours or earning a set number of Stars within a designated time period. Today’s updates are a big part of a broader effort to support creators as they build their careers. Whether creators want to connect with brands, get paid for their content or earn money directly from their fans, we are committed to building the right mix of tools to help them accomplish their goals.

We want to do a better job of explaining how Instagram works. There are a lot of misconceptions out there, and we recognize that we can do more to help people understand what we do. Today, we’re sharing the first in a series of posts that will shed more light on how Instagram’s technology works and how it impacts the experiences that people have across the app. This first post tries to answer questions like \"How does Instagram decide what shows up for me first?”; “Why do some of my posts get more views than others?\"; and \"How does Instagram decide what to show me in Explore?\" What is “the algorithm”? One of the main misconceptions we want to clear up is the existence of “The Algorithm.” Instagram doesn’t have one algorithm that oversees what people do and don’t see on the app. We use a variety of algorithms, classifiers, and processes, each with its own purpose. We want to make the most of your time, and we believe that using technology to personalize your experience is the best way to do that. When we first launched in 2010, Instagram was a single stream of photos in chronological order. But as more people joined and more was shared, it became impossible for most people to see everything, let alone all the posts they cared about. By 2016, people were missing 70% of all their posts in Feed, including almost half of posts from their close connections. So we developed and introduced a Feed that ranked posts based on what you care about most. Each part of the app – Feed, Explore, Reels – uses its own algorithm tailored to how people use it. People tend to look for their closest friends in Stories, but they want to discover something entirely new in Explore. We rank things differently in different parts of the app, based on how people use them. How we rank Feed and Stories Over the years we’ve learned that Feed and Stories are places where people want to see content from their friends, family, and those they are closest to. With any ranking algorithm, how it works can be broken down into steps. We start by defining the set of things we plan to rank in the first place. With Feed and with Stories this is relatively simple; it’s all the recent posts shared by the people you follow. There are a few exceptions, like ads, but the vast majority of what you see is shared by those you follow. Next we take all the information we have about what was posted, the people who made those posts, and your preferences. We call these “signals”, and there are thousands of them. They include everything from what time a post was shared to whether you’re using a phone or the web to how often you like videos. The most important signals across Feed and Stories, roughly in order of importance, are: Information about the post. These are signals both about how popular a post is – think how many people have liked it – and more mundane information about the content itself, like when it was posted, how long it is if it’s a video, and what location, if any, was attached to it. Information about the person who posted. This helps us get a sense for how interesting the person might be to you, and includes signals like how many times people have interacted with that person in the past few weeks. Your activity. This helps us understand what you might be interested in and includes signals such as how many posts you’ve liked. Your history of interacting with someone. This gives us a sense of how interested you are generally in seeing posts from a particular person. An example is whether or not you comment on each other’s posts. From there we make a set of predictions. These are educated guesses at how likely you are to interact with a post in different ways. There are roughly a dozen of these. In Feed, the five interactions we look at most closely are how likely you are to spend a few seconds on a post, comment on it, like it, reshare it, and tap on the profile photo. The more likely you are to take an action, and the more heavily we weigh that action, the higher up you’ll see the post. We add and remove signals and predictions over time, working to get better at surfacing what you’re interested in. There are a few cases where we try to take other considerations into account. One example of this is where we try to avoid showing too many posts from the same person in a row. Another example is Stories that were “reshared” from Feed: until recently, we valued these Stories less, because we’ve heard consistently that people are more interested in seeing original Stories. But we see a swell of reshared posts in big moments – everything from the World Cup to social unrest – and in these moments people were expecting their Stories to reach more people than they did, so we stopped. We always want to lean towards letting people express themselves, but when someone posts something that may jeopardize another person's safety, we step in. We have Community Guidelines that apply not only to Feed and Stories, but to all of Instagram. Most of these rules are focused on keeping people safe. If you post something that goes against our Community Guidelines and we find it, we take it down. If this happens repeatedly, we may prevent you from sharing, and eventually we might suspend your account. If you think we’ve made a mistake – and we do make mistakes – you can appeal by following these steps. Another important case to call out is misinformation. If you post something that third-party fact checkers label as misinformation, we don’t take it down, but we do apply a label and show the post lower in Feed and Stories. If you’ve posted misinformation multiple times, we may make all of your content harder to find.How we rank ExploreExplore was designed to help you discover new things. The grid is made up of recommendations – photos and videos that we go out and find for you – which is very different from Feed and Stories, where the vast majority of what you see is from the accounts you follow.Again, the first step we take is defining a set of posts to rank. To find photos and videos you might be interested in, we look at signals like what posts you've liked, saved, and commented on in the past. Let’s say you’ve recently liked a number of photos from San Francisco’s dumpling chef Cathay Bi (@dumplingclubsf). We then look at who else likes Cathay’s photos, and then what other accounts those people are interested in. Maybe people who like Cathay are also into the SF dim sum spot @dragonbeaux. In that case, the next time you open Explore, we might show you a photo or video from @dragonbeaux. In practice, this means that if you’re interested in dumplings you might see posts about related topics, like gyoza and dim sum, without us necessarily understanding what each post is about.Once we’ve found a group of photos and videos you might be interested in, we then order them by how interested we think you are in each one, much like how we rank Feed and Stories. The best way to guess how interested you are in something is to predict how likely you are to do something with the post. The most important actions we predict in Explore include likes, saves, and shares. The most important signals we look at, in rough order of importance, are:Information about the post. Here we are looking at how popular a post seems to be. These are signals like how many and how quickly other people are liking, commenting, sharing, and saving a post. These signals matter much more in Explore than they do in Feed or in Stories.Your history of interacting with the person who posted. Most likely the post was shared by someone you’ve never heard of, but if you have interacted with them that gives us a sense of how interested you might be in what they shared.Your activity. These are signals like what posts you’ve liked, saved or commented on and how you’ve interacted with posts in Explore in the past.Information about the person who posted. These are signals like how many times people have interacted with that person in the past few weeks, to help find compelling content from a wide array of people.You don’t follow the people you see in Explore, which changes the dynamic when you come across something problematic. If a friend you follow shares something offensive and you see that in your Feed, that’s between you and your friend. If you see something offensive in Explore from someone you’ve never heard of, that’s a different situation.That’s why, in addition to our Community Guidelines, we have rules for what we recommend in places like Explore. We call these our Recommendations Guidelines. These include things like avoiding potentially upsetting or sensitive posts, for example, we aim to not show content that promotes tobacco or vaping use in Explore. How we rank ReelsReels is designed to entertain you. Much like Explore, the majority of what you see is from accounts you don’t follow. So we go through a very similar process where we first source reels we think you might like, and then order them based on how interesting we think they are to you. With Reels, though, we’re specifically focused on what might entertain you. We survey people and ask whether they find a particular reel entertaining or funny, and learn from the feedback to get better at working out what will entertain people, with an eye towards smaller creators. The most important predictions we make are how likely you are to watch a reel all the way through, like it, say it was entertaining or funny, and go to the audio page (a proxy for whether or not you might be inspired to make your own reel.) The most important signals, roughly in order of importance, are: Your activity. We look at things like which reels you’ve liked, commented on, and engaged with recently. These signals help us to understand what content might be relevant to you. Your history of interacting with the person who posted. Like in Explore, it’s likely the video was made by someone you’ve never heard of, but if you have interacted with them that gives us a sense of how interested you might be in what they shared. Information about the reel. These are signals about the content within the video such as the audio track, video understanding based on pixels and whole frames, as well as popularity. Information about the person who posted. We consider popularity to help find compelling content from a wide array of people and give everyone a chance to find their audience. The same Recommendation Guidelines that apply to Explore apply to reels. We also avoid recommending reels for other reasons, such as low-resolution or watermarked reels, reels that are muted or contain borders, reels that are majority text, or reels that focus on political issues. “Shadowbanning” People often accuse us of “shadowbanning” or silencing them. It’s a broad term that people use to describe many different experiences they have on Instagram. We recognize that we haven’t always done enough to explain why we take down content when we do, what is recommendable and what isn’t, and how Instagram works more broadly. As a result, we understand people are inevitably going to come to their own conclusions about why something happened, and that those conclusions may leave people feeling confused or victimized. That’s never our intention, and we’re working hard on improvements here. We also manage millions of reports a day, which means making a mistake on even a small percentage of those reports affects thousands of people. We also hear that people consider their posts getting fewer likes or comments as a form of “shadowbanning”. We can’t promise you that you’ll consistently reach the same amount of people when you post. The truth is most of your followers won’t see what you share, because most look at less than half of their Feed. But we can be more transparent about why we take things down when we do, work to make fewer mistakes – and fix them quickly when we do – and better explain how our systems work. We’re developing better in-app notifications so people know in the moment why, for instance, their post was taken down, and exploring ways to let people know when what they post goes against our Recommendations Guidelines. We’ll have more to share soon, and we’ll also go more in-depth on these topics in this series. How you can influence what you see How you use Instagram heavily influences the things you see and don’t see. You help improve the experience simply by interacting with the profiles and posts you enjoy, but there are a few more explicit things you can do to influence what you see. Pick your Close Friends. You can select your close friends for Stories. This was designed as a way to let you share with just the people closest to you, but we will also prioritize these friends in both Feed and Stories.Mute people you’re not interested in. You can mute an account if you’d like to stop seeing what they share, but are hesitant about unfollowing them entirely. This way, people don't know you've muted them.Mark recommended posts as “Not Interested.” Whenever you see a recommendation, whether it’s in Explore or in Feed, you can indicate you are “not interested” in that post. We will do our best not to show you similar recommendations in the future. Providing more context on how content is ranked, shown, and moderated on Instagram is only part of the equation. There is more we can do to help you to shape your Instagram experience based on what you like. We also need to continue to improve our ranking technology and, of course, make fewer mistakes. Our plan is to be proactive about explaining our work across all three areas from here on out. Stay tuned."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-people-more-control","date":"2021-05-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements","Safety"],"title":"Giving People More Control on Instagram and Facebook","text":"You may have noticed that we’ve been testing hiding like counts on Instagram for a while. Today, we’re announcing that everyone on Instagram and Facebook will now have the option to hide their public like counts, so they can decide what works for them. We tested hiding like counts to see if it might depressurize people’s experience on Instagram. What we heard from people and experts was that not seeing like counts was beneficial for some, and annoying to others, particularly because people use like counts to get a sense for what’s trending or popular, so we’re giving you the choice. We’re looking for more ways to give people control over their experience. That’s why we announced new tools to allow people to filter offensive content from their DMs and gave people ways to control what they see and share on Facebook’s News Feed – like the Feed Filter Bar, Favorites Feed and Choose Who Can Comment. New options to hide public like countsStarting today, we’re giving you the option to hide like counts on all posts in your feed. You’ll also have the option to hide like counts on your own posts, so others can’t see how many likes your posts get. This way, if you like, you can focus on the photos and videos being shared, instead of how many likes posts get. You can hide like counts on others’ posts by visiting the new Posts section in Settings. This control applies to all the posts in your feed.Collaborating with experts and creatorsWhat one person wants from their Instagram experience is different from the next, and people’s needs are changing. We’ve been working closely with third-party experts to better understand how to empower people, build self-awareness and shape a more positive experience on Instagram.As part of these efforts, we collaborated with The Jed Foundation and creators such as Bunny Michael (@bunnymichael) and Schuyler Bailar (@pinkmantaray) on a new Instagram Guide, which offers advice on how to manage pressure online. We’re also funding more external research about people’s experiences on Instagram, and how we can improve our policies and products to support our community. We’re currently requesting research proposals from global academics and non-profits. If you’re interested you can find more information here on how to submit.Changing the way people view like counts is a big shift.

From activists and community builders, to educators and creatives, they embody what it means to inspire, start global trends, create new genres and forms of expression, and use their voices to hold people and companies accountable. When we established the Instagram Equity team, our goal was to dig deeper into the concerns raised by marginalized communities on Instagram. Over the past few months, our team has been building on the foundation established last summer to create a more equitable platform. Since our last update we’ve made further progress, which we wanted to share with you today. First of all, what does the Equity team do? The Equity team was formed to address the challenges that people from marginalized backgrounds may face on Instagram. We know these challenges cannot all be solved overnight, and that in trying to do too many things at once, we won’t do any one particularly well. That’s why we decided to first dig deeper into the specific concerns raised by Black people on our platform, build solutions, and make changes that make them feel more supported. We believe that doing so not only benefits everyone on Instagram, but also gives us a model for how we can approach other marginalized communities’ needs. Early work here includes extensive research with different subsets and intersections of the Black community to make sure we understand and serve its diversity. We’ve spoken with creators, activists, policy minds and everyday people to unpack the diversity of experiences people have when using the platform. We are also in the process of auditing the technology that powers our automated enforcement, recommendations and ranking to better understand the changes necessary to help ensure people do not feel marginalized on our platform. This foundational work helped us to narrow our focus, and finalize what our team will be concentrating on more specifically. Our team will now focus on three areas: Helping every Instagram employee prioritize building equitable products and toolsPromoting fairness on the platform through our technology and automated systemsUsing Instagram to create more opportunities for empowerment.Helping every Instagram employee prioritize building equitable products and tools Making the platform more equitable is everyone’s responsibility at Instagram. Over the last few months, the Equity team launched an internal program to help employees responsible for building new products and technologies factor in equity at every step of their work. The program, called the Equitable Product Program, was created to help teams consider what changes, big and small, they can make to have a positive impact on marginalized communities. It gives employees the tools to think holistically about what they are building, specifically considering the impact of new features on marginalized communities. Equitable Product Program includes guiding teams through product audits with equity in mind, trainings, helping teams rename loaded terms from the codebase (i.e., moving from industry standards like whitelist and blacklist to allowlist and blocklist for example), and more. So far we’ve worked with three of our largest teams (the Feed and Stories, Reels, and Creator teams) to reassess those products and understand improvements we can make. Over the next year and a half we'll expand this program to all Instagram teams. On the more technical side, we launched Machine Learning Model Cards on Instagram, a checklist that helps ensure new machine learning is designed with equity top of mind. Model cards work similar to a questionnaire, and make sure teams stop to consider any ramifications their new models may have before they’re implemented, to reduce the potential for algorithmic bias. Model cards pose a series of equity-oriented questions and considerations to help reduce the potential for unintended impacts on specific communities, and they allow us to remedy any impact before we launch new technology. As an example, ahead of the US election, we put temporary measures in place to make it harder for people to come across misinformation or violent content, and our teams used model cards to ensure appropriate ML models were used to help protect the election, while also ensuring our enforcement was fair and did not have disproportionate impact on any one community. Over the next 18 months we plan to expand this program, helping every team across Instagram use these cards to build fairness into every step of the technology we develop, and reduce potential impacts on underserved communities. Promoting fairness on the platform through our technology and automated systems Throughout our research, a recurring theme was that people wanted more transparency into how our systems work and how decisions around content are made. People felt that their account growth and/or engagement had been impacted in a way that they did not understand. People sometimes referred to this impact as “shadowbanning.” We heard from our conversations with people that this was most often tied to: Lack of understanding on why people may be getting fewer likes or comments than before;Perceptions that our decisions and policies do not consider the cultural and/or historical nuances of different communities’ lived experiences;Confusion around our enforcement, either feeling like certain communities were held to a standard that other communities were not, or that our systems took down content without clear explanation.Technical issues, which some may have perceived as forms of suppression. Our research has given us a deeper understanding of why perceptions of bias exist, laying the foundation for the tools and products with more transparency baked in. This includes tools to provide more transparency around any restrictions on a person’s account or if their reach is being limited, as well as actions they can take to remediate. We also plan to build direct in-app communication to inform people when bugs and technical issues may be impacting their content. In the coming months, we'll share more details on these new features. Using Instagram to create more opportunities for economic empowerment Throughout the course of the pandemic, marginalized communities have been disproportionately impacted – from having inequitable access to healthcare, being faced with job losses and much more. So much of this is rooted in institutional and systemic racism, and requires that we work together as a society to address. Across Facebook and Instagram, we want to use our platform to help close gaps wherever possible. On addressing health disparities, this means we’re working closely with our health teams to help ensure we’re connecting people with accurate resources on vaccine safety, eligibility, and availability. More generally, we know that Black people globally have often not had the same access to economic opportunities. While we cannot solve institutional and systemic racism we see in society on our own, we can explore opportunities to help close these gaps on Instagram especially when it comes to supporting Black businesses and creators. We kicked off this work last year, committing $25M to Black creators across Facebook and Instagram, and as part of this investment we launched a new program to equip the next generation of Black creators with the funding and resources to succeed on and off-line. Additionally, we launched a #BuyBlack sticker in Stories to help people identify and support Black-owned businesses, and in the coming months will roll out new product features to help people discover and amplify Black-owned businesses and build specific features to help people find Black-owned businesses on Instagram, while also working to protect them from potentially hurtful interactions. — — Our team shows up every day to improve the experiences of marginalized communities on Instagram. Our research over the past year has helped us to better recognize and understand, but we know there will always be more work to do in this space. We’ll continue working tirelessly to help make sure everyone on the platform feels safe to express themselves, empowered by our tools, and supported by Instagram."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-tools-to-protect-our-community-from-abuse","date":"2021-04-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements","Safety"],"title":"Introducing new tools to protect our community from abuse","text":"We recently shared an update on our work to combat abuse and hate speech on Instagram, which included stricter penalties for people who send abusive Direct Messages (DMs).

We’re dropping some new features that we hope you’ll enjoy, but we also want to say a big thank-you to everyone who uses Instagram around the world. Every day you inspire us with how you push culture forward, creating trends that become mainstream. Birthdays are a good time to reflect on where we’ve been and where we’re headed. Since we started, people have come to Instagram to connect with their friends, explore their interests, and be entertained. And as they did, a global community was born, a community that did more, and mattered more, than we ever dreamed. From fashion, to food, to entertainment, to travel, to the emergence of #weeklyfluff, people on Instagram have shaped the world around them. Who could have predicted that in 2014, astronaut Steven R. Swanson would share the first selfie uploaded to Instagram from space, or that in 2019 a humble little egg would break a world record. Beyoncé shocked us all with a pregnancy-reveal photo that became a truly iconic moment; Australia Football League's player Tayla Harris' kick photo started a national conversation about sexism in sports; and even the Pope came onboard. Through it all, meme accounts have kept us entertained, and countless people have turned their passions into a living on Instagram.We’ve also seen how people all over the world can rally around each other for support and connection, with important conversations including #setembroamarelo, #iweigh, #realconvo, #366daysofkindness, and #kindcomments. And how our community has used Instagram to speak out against issues like systemic racism and inequity, helping spread movements like #blacklivesmatter, #metoo, #lovewins, and many more. Even now, as 2020 has tested us in ways we never could have imagined, DJ D-Nice and Verzuz battles have brought us together, added some levity, and given us an excuse to dance.I’m proud of where we are today, but I’m thinking a lot about where we’re going. Right now, we’re witnessing enormous shifts in how people create and enjoy culture. One of the most profound is the shift of power from the organization to the individual. Athletes are arguably more relevant than teams. Artists can showcase their work without galleries or museums. Musicians have ways to reach people without labels. Culture is the collection of stories we tell, and we believe everyone has something worth saying. But it’s often young people and creators who spark those conversations. They set the trends; they signal what’s next.To keep pace with what’s next, we have to adapt, too. Instagram’s home was designed at a different moment. Over the coming months, you’ll see some major changes from us, like tabs for Reels and shopping, and some big improvements to messaging. We’ll look to accelerate ways for creators to make a living and for small businesses to sell their products. Through all these changes, our community will remain the heart of Instagram, and we’ll stay focused on keeping people safe and building new features that fight bullying, improve equity, address fairness, and help people feel supported.We know that updating an app used by over a billion people is a big responsibility, but it’s important to adapt. I’m excited about how these changes will help our community create new waves of culture, and I can’t wait to see how you’ll inspire us next.- Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/national-bullying-prevention-month","date":"2020-10-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Announcements"],"title":"Kicking Off National Bullying Prevention Month With New Anti-Bullying Features","text":"As we kick off National Bullying Prevention Month, we’re announcing two new features to reduce negative interactions, including bullying and harassment, in comments.

Additional Ways We’re Preventing Bullying in Comments In the last few days, we started testing a new feature that automatically hides comments similar to others that have been reported.

Since launching comment warning, we saw that reminding people of the consequences of bullying on Instagram and providing real-time feedback as they are writing the comment is the most effective way to shift behavior. These new warnings let people take a moment to step back and reflect on their words and lay out the potential consequences should they proceed. We just started testing this feature in select languages. Our Progress, One Year LaterSince we first announced our commitment, we rolled out warnings in comments and captions to ensure people reconsider their words before posting something that is potentially offensive. In less than a year since launching globally, we've seen a meaningful decrease in negative interactions in both comments and captions. We’ve also given people easier ways to manage who can tag or mention them, and are in the process of rolling out similar controls for messages in Instagram Direct. More than 35 million Instagram accounts are using or have used Restrict since it launched last October, ensuring they can safely control their Instagram experience; a majority of the negative interactions they were receiving from a bully are now hidden. In the last few months we rolled out the ability to delete comments in bulk and block or restrict multiple accounts and have seen over 3.5 million accounts use these controls to reduce negative experiences. And we’ve made it easy to highlight positive interactions with Pinned Comments, as our research shows that elevating positive content is an effective way to set positive norms on your account."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/say-hi-to-messenger-introducing-new-messaging-features-for-instagram","date":"2020-09-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Say 👋 to Messenger: Introducing New Messaging Features for Instagram","text":"Today, we’re announcing an update to Instagram DMs by introducing a new Messenger experience on the app. Messaging has come a long way since we first brought it to Instagram. We’ve been exploring how messaging should evolve as we grow. On Facebook’s family of apps alone, people send more than 100 billion messages to their friends and family each day. These days, we rely on video calls to hang out with friends, send memes and GIFs to communicate what we really think (but can't always say), and share funny photos and voice notes to stay in touch. People are communicating in private spaces now more than ever. More than a billion people already use Messenger as a place to share, hang out and express themselves with family and friends. That’s why we’re connecting the Messenger and Instagram experience to bring some of the best Messenger features to Instagram – so you have access to the best messaging experience, no matter which app you use. People on Instagram can decide whether to update immediately to this new experience. In our research, four out of five people who use messaging apps in the US say that spending more time connecting with friends and family on these apps is important to them, yet one out of three people sometimes find it difficult to remember where to find a certain conversation thread. With this update, it will be even easier to stay connected without thinking about which app to use to reach your friends and family. We're also adding more than 10 new features so you can stay close to your friends. Selfie stickers are a unique hybrid of Boomerang, emojis, and selfies – and a new way to react to conversations. Watch Together lets you watch trending videos with friends on IGTV during a video call. We’re also introducing vanish mode, where you can set messages to automatically disappear after they’re seen. Messages and calls from friends and family using Instagram will stay in your Instagram app. The main change is that people using the Messenger app can now reach you on Instagram without you needing to download a new app, and vice versa. You can also control where you receive messages and calls, such as in your chats, in your message requests or not at all. The Best of Messenger We’re also bringing familiar features from Messenger like replying to a specific message, forwarding a message, and customizable chat colors and themes. Every day, more than 10 million people customize their chat threads in Messenger with custom colors and nicknames. You’ll be able to use custom emoji reactions, and soon, message effects to put more emotion and visual flair behind your reactions and messages. Over time, you’ll see even more fun ways to connect with friends and family. Some features such as custom emoji reactions and selfie stickers will be available on Instagram first and will come to Messenger soon after. Here are all the features coming soon to the new Messenger experience on Instagram: Communicate Across Apps: Seamlessly connect with friends and family across Instagram and Messenger by using either app to send messages and join video calls.Watch Together: Enjoy watching videos on Facebook Watch, IGTV, Reels (coming soon!), TV shows, movies, and more with friends and family during a video call.Vanish Mode: Choose a mode where seen messages disappear after they’re seen or when you close the chat. Selfie Stickers: Create a series of boomerang stickers with your selfie to use in conversation.Chat Colors: Personalize your chats with fun color gradients. Custom Emoji Reactions: Create a shortcut of your favorite emojis to react quickly to messages from friends.Forwarding: Easily share great content with up to five friends or groups.Replies: Respond directly to a specific message in your chat and keep the conversation flowing.Animated Message Effects: Add visual flair to your message with animated send effects.Message Controls: Decide who can message you directly, and who can’t message you at all.Enhanced Reporting and Blocking Updates: Now you can report full conversations in addition to single messages on Instagram, and receive proactive blocking suggestions across Instagram and Messenger when you add your accounts in the new Accounts Center.Privacy and Safety With this new update, you’ll have choice and controls to manage your privacy, including whether message requests go to your Chats list, your Message Requests folder, or whether you receive them at all. We offer tools for people to report suspicious activity, and take action to block someone across apps to stop unwanted messages and calls when something doesn’t feel right. You can learn more about your privacy here. We’re rolling out these new features on Instagram and Messenger in a few countries around the world, and we’ll expand globally soon. This is only the start to making it easier to stay in touch with friends and family across our apps. Stay tuned for even more fun ways to connect in the future."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/updates-on-our-equity-work","date":"2020-09-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"An Update on our Equity Work","text":"In the midst of a global pandemic, upcoming elections, and increasing racial tensions, we’re seeing a shift in the way people are using Instagram. More than ever, people are turning to the platform to raise awareness for the racial, civic, and social causes they care about. It’s a big part of why we committed in June to review the ways Instagram could be underserving certain groups of people. We have a responsibility to look at what we build and how we build, so that people’s experiences with our product better mirrors the actions and aspirations of our community. Below is an update on areas where we’ve made progress this summer. This is by no means comprehensive, and we have a lot more to do, but I’m going to share regular updates so our community knows that this work is important and ongoing. New Equity Team To ensure this work is fully supported, we’ve created a dedicated product group – the Instagram Equity team – that will focus on better understanding and addressing bias in our product development and people’s experiences on Instagram. The Equity team will focus on creating fair and equitable products. This includes working with Facebook's Responsible AI team to ensure algorithmic fairness. In addition, they’ll create new features that respond to the needs of underserved communities. Seperate from this new product group we’re also hiring a new Director for Diversity and Inclusion for Instagram who will help to advance Instagram’s goal of finding, keeping, and growing more diverse talent. Harassment and Hate We’ve developed and updated a number of company-wide policies to support communities worldwide. We updated our policies to more specifically account for certain kinds of implicit hate speech, such as content depicting blackface, or stereotypes about Jewish people. We also strengthened enforcements against people who make serious rape threats, and we’ll now disable any account that makes these threats as soon as we become aware of them, rather than removing just the content. In addition, we’ll ensure involuntary public figures – people who may not have sought attention and who we’ve seen are often members of marginalized communities – are protected from harassment and bullying just as they were before finding themselves in the public eye. We’ve continued to prioritize the removal of content that violates our policy against hate groups. This includes removing 23 different banned organizations, over half of which supported white supremacy. In addition, we recently announced updates to take action on organizations tied to violence, such as QAnon. We’ve also made some changes for creators and businesses. For example, people with Business and Creator accounts can now manage who can send them direct messages. And we’ve begun expanding comment warnings to include comments in Live, so people will be asked to reconsider comments that might be offensive before they’re posted. Verification We spent the past two months reviewing Instagram’s verification practices and have started making changes to ensure a fairer process. An account must meet certain criteria before we verify it, including a degree of notability. We measure notability through press articles about the person applying for verification. We’ve now expanded our list of press sources we consider in the process to include more Black, LGBTQ+, and Latinx media. While follower count was never a requirement to get verified through the in-app form (which anyone can apply for), we did have certain systems in place that prioritized accounts with high followings to help get through the tens of thousands of requests received every day. We’ve since removed this from the automated part of the process. Distribution In response to ongoing concerns around perceived censorship on Instagram, we recently published the guidelines we use to determine the types of content that can appear in places like Explore. Our hope is that people will better understand why some types of content aren’t included in recommendations across Instagram and Facebook, and therefore may not be distributed as widely. We consulted over 50 leading experts specializing in recommendation systems, social computing, freedom of expression, safety, civil and digital rights in developing these guidelines. *** As I said in my first post, this work will take time, but it’s important to do and to take the time to get right. If you’re interested in helping us do this work, check out some of the open roles we’re currently hiring for on the Policy team and Product team. ***"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-authenticity-measures-on-instagram","date":"2020-08-12T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing New Authenticity Measures on Instagram","text":"We want the content you see on Instagram to be authentic and to come from real people, not bots or others trying to mislead you. Starting today, we will begin asking people to confirm who’s behind an account when we see a pattern of potential inauthentic behavior. By prompting the people behind accounts to confirm their information, we will be able to better understand when accounts are attempting to mislead their followers, hold them accountable, and keep our community safe. We will look at a range of signals to determine if an account holder needs to confirm their information. We want to be clear that this change will apply only to a small number of our community. Most people will not be affected. This includes accounts potentially engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior, or when we see the majority of someone's followers are in a different country to their location, or if we find signs of automation, such as bot accounts for example. If we see signs of potential inauthentic activity, we will require the account holder to confirm who they are, and once an account holder verifies their information, their account will function as usual unless we have reason to investigate further. IDs will be stored securely and deleted within 30 days once our review is completed, and won’t be shared on the person’s profile as pseudonymity is still an important part of Instagram. If an account chooses not to confirm their information, their content may receive reduced distribution, or the account may be disabled. Visit the Help Center for more information on the identity verification process, and the types of IDs we accept."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-reels-announcement","date":"2020-08-04T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing Instagram Reels","text":"Today we’re announcing Instagram Reels: a new way to create and discover short, entertaining videos on Instagram.

We'll begin with a small test to create a Personal Fundraiser in the US, UK and Ireland on Android, followed by iOS. If you live in a country where you can donate to a fundraiser through our donation sticker, you are also eligible to donate to a Personal Fundraiser on Android starting today. Since January, people have raised more than $US 100 million for COVID-19 fundraisers globally across Instagram and Facebook. In the last 30 days, donations on Instagram have doubled in the US. We’ve also seen a large wave of digital activism responding to the global conversation around racial justice. From people raising money to buy medical equipment for Black Lives Matter protesters, rebuilding Black-owned small businesses affected by COVID-19 and funding educational resources related to racial justice, people are eager to mobilize around causes they care about. Now, we’re making it easier to create fundraisers directly on Instagram that benefit such personal causes."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/ensuring-black-voices-are-heard","date":"2020-06-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements","Safety"],"title":"Ensuring Black Voices are Heard","text":"In the last few weeks, we’ve seen an incredible movement happening around the world. As these important conversations have come to our platform, we’ve seen communities on Instagram mobilizing to demand justice and express solidarity, support Black-owned businesses, elevate Black voices, and raise awareness for the equality of Black people everywhere. At the same time, we’re also hearing concern about whether we suppress Black voices and whether our products and policies treat everyone equally. The irony that we’re a platform that stands for elevating Black voices, but at the same time Black people are often harassed, afraid of being ‘shadowbanned’, and disagree with many content takedowns, is not lost on me. This is a moment when people around the world are rightfully demanding actions over words, and we owe the same to our community. It starts with accounting for the experiences and challenges that underrepresented groups, such as our Black community, face when they use Instagram. We’ve done a lot of work to better understand the impact our platform has on different groups, and that’s helped us get to where we are today. But I think there’s more to do across some key areas, which fit into our broader company commitments. We need to better support the Black community within our own organization, as well as on our platform. One of the ways we’ll do this is by taking a harder look at how our product impacts communities differently, specifically around: Harassment: Any work to address the inequalities Black people face has to start with the specific safety issues they experience day to day, both on and off platform. Then we need to address potential gaps in how our products and policies protect people from those issues.Account verification: We’re looking into our current verification criteria and will make changes to ensure it’s as inclusive as possible. Verification is an area we constantly get questions on – what the guidelines are, and whether or not the criteria is favoring some groups more than others.Distribution: We’ll review how content is filtered on Explore and Hashtag pages to understand where there may be vulnerability to bias. On top of that, we need to be clearer about how decisions are made when it comes to how people’s posts get distributed. Over the years we’ve heard these concerns sometimes described across social media as “shadowbanning” – filtering people without transparency, and limiting their reach as a result. Soon we’ll be releasing more information about the types of content we avoid recommending on Explore and other places.Algorithmic bias: Some technologies risk repeating the patterns developed by our biased societies. While we do a lot of work to help prevent subconscious bias in our products, we need to take a harder look at the underlying systems we’ve built, and where we need to do more to keep bias out of these decisions.This work is going to take some time, but we’re going to provide updates over the next few months – both about what we learn and what we address. These efforts won’t stop with the disparities people may experience solely on the basis of race; we’re also going to look at how we can better serve other underrepresented groups that use our product. In the last year alone the feedback we've received from communities like LGBTQ+ groups, body positivity activists, and artists has helped us build a more inclusive product. Our goal is that Instagram is a place where everyone feels safe, supported, and free to express themselves, and I’m hoping this work will get us closer to that goal."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/supporting-creators-on-instagram","date":"2020-05-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","Business","Product","Announcements"],"title":"Doing More to Support Creators on Instagram","text":"Creators have always been at the core of our community. Since the earliest days of Instagram, they have inspired people around the world with their talents, shared their lives and built their personal brands from the ground up. We have always been committed to supporting creators as they turn their passion into livelihoods - because every creator is unique, that means providing a mix of monetization tools to help creators of all sizes, from the emerging to the more established. Given the uncertain circumstances many are facing today, that commitment is more important than ever.

In recent months, we’ve seen creators embrace Live in new ways, leading to a 70% increase in views from February to March. From fitness instructors to dancers, artists to chefs, Live has helped creators and businesses stay connected to their followers and bring people together. With badges, creators can generate income from the content they’re already creating. Badges will appear next to a person’s name throughout the live video.

During difficult and isolating times like this, we know it can be even more important. As social distancing has forced everyone to stay apart, more people have turned to Instagram and Facebook Live to stay connected with their communities. This rapid rise in usage has created a lot of good during this crisis – raising money for frontline workers and underserved communities, driving awareness of healthy habits, encouraging people to stay safe by staying home, and bringing people together through new forms of entertainment. But it’s also highlighted some confusion across the community -- especially around the use of recorded music in Live on both Facebook and Instagram. At its core, Live brings people together in a real-time and unproduced way, which has opened up new creative opportunities for many creators, artists, and other public figures. So as we continue building for the long term, we’re sharing guidelines and product improvements around music in Instagram and Facebook videos and livestreams. Clarifying Our Guidelines for Including Music in Video We want to encourage musical expression on our platforms while also ensuring that we uphold our agreements with rights holders. These agreements help protect the artists, songwriters, and partners who are the cornerstone of the music community -- and we're grateful for how they've enabled the amazing creativity we've seen in this time. Our partnerships with rights holders have brought people together around music on our platforms. As part of our licensing agreements, there are limitations around the amount of recorded music that can be included in Live broadcasts or videos. While the specifics of our licensing agreements are confidential, today we’re sharing some general guidelines to help you plan your videos better: Music in stories and traditional live music performances (e.g., filming an artist or band performing live) are permitted.The greater the number of full-length recorded tracks in a video, the more likely it may be limited (more below on what we mean by “limited”).For that reason, shorter clips of music are recommended.There should always be a visual component to your video; recorded audio should not be the primary purpose of the video. These guidelines are consistent across live and recorded video on both Facebook and Instagram, and for all types of accounts -- i.e. pages, profiles, verified and unverified accounts. And although music is launched on our platforms in more than 90 countries, there are places where it is not yet available. So if your video includes recorded music, it may not be available for use in those locations. People also have access to a library of custom music and sound effects at no cost using Facebook’s Sound Collection. The Sound Collection includes thousands of tracks available to use in the videos you share on Facebook and Instagram without any limits – spanning genres like hip-hop, pop, jazz, country, and more."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/supporting-well-being-with-instagram-guides","date":"2020-05-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Using Instagram Guides to Support Well-being","text":"We want Instagram to be a place where you can easily find reliable information and inspiration from your favorite accounts.

Photo and video based misinformation is increasingly a challenge across our industry, and something our teams have been focused on addressing. In May of this year, we began working with third-party fact-checkers in the US to help identify, review, and label false information. These partners independently assess false information to help us catch it and reduce its distribution. Today, we’re expanding our fact-checking program globally to allow fact-checking organizations around the world to assess and rate misinformation on our platform. What does this mean? When content has been rated as false or partly false by a third-party fact-checker, we reduce its distribution by removing it from Explore and hashtag pages, and reducing its visibility in Feed and Stories. In addition, it will be labeled so people can better decide for themselves what to read, trust, and share. When these labels are applied, they will appear to everyone around the world viewing that content – in feed, profile, stories, and direct messages. We use image matching technology to find further instances of this content and apply the label, helping reduce the spread of misinformation. In addition, if something is rated false or partly false on Facebook, starting today we’ll automatically label identical content if it is posted on Instagram (and vice versa). The label will link out to the rating from the fact-checker and provide links to articles from credible sources that debunk the claim(s) made in the post. We make content from accounts that repeatedly receive these labels harder to find by removing it from Explore and hashtag pages. To determine which content should be sent to fact-checkers for review, we use a combination of feedback from our community and technology.

Asking for Your Date of Birth Starting today, we will be asking for your date of birth when creating an account on Instagram. According to our Terms of Use, you must be at least 13 years old to have an account in most countries. Asking for this information will help prevent underage people from joining Instagram, help us keep young people safer and enable more age-appropriate experiences overall. Your birthday will not be visible to others on Instagram, but you’ll be able to see it when viewing your own private account information. If you’ve connected your Facebook account to your Instagram account, we will add the date of birth that’s on your Facebook profile. This is not public information and only you will be able to see it when viewing your own account information on Instagram. Editing your date of birth on Facebook will also change it on Instagram. If you don’t have a Facebook account or if you have not connected your accounts, you can add or edit your birthday directly on Instagram. Building Age-Appropriate and Safer ExperiencesIn the coming months, we will use the birthday information you share with us to create more tailored experiences, such as education around account controls and recommended privacy settings for young people.Strengthening Messaging PrivacyLastly, we are also taking steps to help you control who can send you direct messages on Instagram. This gives you the ability to allow only people you follow to message and add you to group threads. People who enable this setting will no longer receive messages, group message requests or story replies from anyone they have not chosen to follow.

For current information about our suicide and self-injury content detection technology, please visit our Safety Center. As described in the Safety Center, our algorithms are intended to help identify potential suicide and self-injury content and are not intended to diagnose or treat any mental health or other condition. ------------ Nothing is more important to me than the safety of the people who use Instagram, particularly the most vulnerable. Suicide and self-harm are difficult and complex topics that people understandably care deeply about. These issues are complicated – there are many opinions about how best to approach them — but they matter a lot, and to me, as a parent, they certainly hit home. My first thoughts are with anyone dealing with these difficult issues, and their family and friends. I can’t begin to imagine what they are going through. I also recognise that simply keeping people in my thoughts is not enough. We at Instagram owe it to everyone who uses our platform — especially those who may be at risk of suicide and self-harm — to do everything we can to keep them safe. Two things are true about online communities, and they are in conflict with one another. First, the tragic reality is that some young people are influenced in a negative way by what they see online, and as a result they might hurt themselves. This is a real risk. But at the same time, there are many young people who are coming online to get support with the struggles they’re having — like those sharing healed scars or talking about their recovery from an eating disorder. Often these online support networks are the only way to find other people who have shared their experiences. Based on expert advice from academics and mental health organisations like the Samaritans in the UK and National Suicide Prevention Line in the US, we aim to strike the difficult balance between allowing people to share their mental health experiences while also protecting others from being exposed to potentially harmful content. We understand that content which could be helpful to some may be harmful to others. In my conversations with young people who have struggled with these issues, I’ve heard that the same image might be helpful to someone one day, but triggering the next. That’s why we don’t allow people to share content that encourages or promotes self-harm or suicide. We have never permitted that. Earlier this year we strengthened our approach on content related to suicide and self-harm. In February, we prohibited graphic images of self-harm and built new technology to find and act on this type of content, and we have worked to ensure that this sort of content, and those accounts sharing it, are not recommended. As a result, we have been able to act on twice as much content as before. In the three months following our policy change we have removed, reduced the visibility of, or added sensitivity screens to more than 834,000 pieces of content. We were able to find more than 77% of this content before it was reported to us. While this is progress, we know the work here is never done. This past month, we further expanded our policies to prohibit more types of self-harm and suicide content. We will no longer allow fictional depictions of self-harm or suicide on Instagram, such as drawings or memes or content from films or comics that use graphic imagery. We will also remove other imagery that may not show self-harm or suicide, but does include associated materials or methods. Accounts sharing this type of content will also not be recommended in search or in our discovery surfaces, like Explore. And we’ll send more people more resources with localized helplines like the Samaritans and PAPYRUS in the UK or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and The Trevor Project in the United States. These are complex issues that no single company or set of policies and practices alone can solve. I’m often asked, why do we allow any suicide or self-harm content at all on Instagram? Experts tell us that giving people a chance to share their most difficult moments and their stories of recovery can be a vital means of support. That preventing people from sharing this type of content could not only stigmatize these types of mental health issues, but might hinder loved ones from identifying and responding to a cry for help. But getting our approach right requires more than a single change to our policies or a one-time update to our technology. Our work here is never done. Our policies and technology have to evolve as new trends emerge and behaviors change. To help us stay aware of new trends or cultural nuances, we meet every month with academics and experts on suicide and self-harm. We are also working with the Swedish mental health organization, MIND, to understand the role that technology and social media has on the lives of young people. In the U.K, we are working with the Samaritans on an industry-wide effort to shape new guidelines to help people in distress. Outside of Europe we also have additional technology that helps us proactively find people who might be in need. We want to bring this to Europe but there are important legal considerations under EU law, so we’re working with our European regulator. Any time we hear about someone harming themselves and who may have been influenced by what they saw on our platforms, we are reminded of the struggles many young people face on and offline. We will continue working to keep everyone safe on Instagram, while at the same time making it possible for people to access support that can make a difference when they need it the most.

We also want to give people more control over the data they share with other apps and services. So today, we’re introducing new in-app features to help you better control the data you share with third-parties through Instagram. Third-party apps and websites often provide an option to “Import photos from Instagram” or to “Connect/Link to Instagram.” Some examples include apps that allow you to easily print your Instagram photos or help you build a website. After connecting your account to a third-party service, you may grant them access to some of your profile information, such as your username and photos. Starting today, we’re making it easier for people to manage all of the third-party services they connect to their Instagram account. You can now manage your connections to third party services by going to “Settings” in the Instagram app. Next tap “Security,” then tap “Apps and Websites.” From there, you’ll have the option to remove any third-party services you no longer want connected to your Instagram account. When you remove a third-party service, they will no longer have access to new data on your account. To ensure you know what specific data third parties are requesting from you, we’re also introducing an updated authorization screen that lists all the information the third party is requesting to access. You’ll have the option to “cancel” or “authorize” this access directly from the authorization screen. These updates will be rolling out gradually over the next six months and will ultimately allow people to have more control over the data they share with third-party services.

Over the last few years, we’ve introduced several new ways to share visually on Instagram and connect with people you care about – from sharing everyday moments on Stories to visual messages on Direct. But for your smaller circle of friends, we saw the need to stay more connected throughout the day, so you can communicate what you’re doing and how you’re feeling through photos and videos. That’s why we built Threads, a new way to message with close friends in a dedicated, private space. Threads is a standalone app designed with privacy, speed, and your close connections in mind. You can share photos, videos, messages, Stories, and more with your Instagram close friends list. You are in control of who can reach you on Threads, and you can customize the experience around the people who matter most. Message Only Your Close Friends Last year, we introduced Close Friends, for sharing more personal moments with a select group of people you choose. Now, you can use Threads to message those people on your Instagram close friends list and you’ll have a dedicated inbox and notifications just for them. If you don’t have a list set up yet, you can make one directly from Threads when you download the app. Share Photos and Videos Instantly Threads is the fastest way to share a photo or video with your close friends on Instagram. It opens directly to the camera and allows you to add shortcuts, so you can share what you’re doing in just two taps. Find Out What Friends Are Up To With Status We’ve heard that you want an easier way to keep up with your friends throughout the day – especially when you don’t have the time to send a photo or have a conversation. That’s why we created status. You can choose from a suggested status (📚 Studying), create your own (😅 Procrastinating), or turn on Auto Status (🚗 On the move), which automatically shares little bits of context on where you are without giving away your coordinates. Only your close friends will see your status, and it’s completely opt-in. Status was created with your privacy in mind – you control whether you share your status and with whom. Learn more about privacy and Threads here. Continue Using Instagram Direct As You Do Today Threads offers a new, dedicated home for your favorite conversations. Messages from your close friends list will appear in both Threads and Direct, so you have full control over how and with whom you want to interact. Threads will begin rolling out globally today on iOS and Android. We hope that Threads can bring you a little closer to the people you care about. – Robby Stein, Director of Product, Instagram"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/stand-up-against-bullying-with-restrict","date":"2019-10-01T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Using Restrict on Instagram to Stand up to Bullying","text":"Starting today, you can protect your account from unwanted interactions with a new feature called Restrict. Bullying is a complex issue, and we know that young people face a disproportionate amount of online bullying but are reluctant to report or block peers who bully them. Restrict is designed to empower you to quietly protect your account while still keeping an eye on a bully. You can restrict someone by swiping left on a comment, through the Privacy tab in Settings, or directly on the profile of the account you intend to restrict. Protecting Your Account With Restrict Once Restrict is enabled, comments on your posts from a person you have restricted will only be visible to that person. You can choose to view the comment by tapping “See Comment”; approve the comment so everyone can see it; delete it; or ignore it. You won’t receive any notifications for comments from a restricted account. Direct messages will automatically move to Message Request, and you will not receive notifications from a restricted account. You can still view the messages but the restricted account will not be able to see when you’ve read their direct messages or when you are active on Instagram. You can choose to “Unrestrict” the account and future messages will go directly to your inbox. Using Creativity to Spread Positivity We’re also putting our community’s creativity at the center of our work. We wanted to create a flexible tool that allows young people to speak up, define what’s acceptable in their community and spread positivity on Instagram. Recently, we rolled out a Create Don’t Hate sticker in Stories, calling on our community to share how they use their creative talents to stand up to bullying. For National Bullying Prevention Month, we’ve partnered with PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center, the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and Brazilian community illustrator @leonatsume to bring to life poster ideas developed during our Teen Bullying Prevention Design Workshop this year. These posters will be distributed to thousands of schools and community centers across the US. In the coming weeks, we’ll roll out a global anti-bullying sticker in Stories, inspired by these designs to support anti-bullying initiatives around the world. We are committed to leading the industry in the fight against online bullying and will continue to build on that commitment long term. We look forward to sharing more updates soon."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/account-disable-policy-changes-on-instagram","date":"2019-07-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements","Safety"],"title":"Account Disable Policy Changes on Instagram","text":"Today, we are announcing a change to our account disable policy. Together with Facebook, we develop policies to ensure Instagram is a supportive place for everyone. These changes will help us quickly detect and remove accounts that repeatedly violate our policies. Under our existing policy, we disable accounts that have a certain percentage of violating content. We are now rolling out a new policy where, in addition to removing accounts with a certain percentage of violating content, we will also remove accounts with a certain number of violations within a window of time. Similarly to how policies are enforced on Facebook, this change will allow us to enforce our policies more consistently and hold people accountable for what they post on Instagram. We are also introducing a new notification process to help people understand if their account is at risk of being disabled. This notification will also offer the opportunity to appeal content deleted. To start, appeals will be available for content deleted for violations of our nudity and pornography, bullying and harassment, hate speech, drug sales, and counter-terrorism policies, but we’ll be expanding appeals in the coming months. If content is found to be removed in error, we will restore the post and remove the violation from the account’s record.

We know bullying is a challenge many face, particularly young people. We are committed to leading the industry in the fight against online bullying, and we are rethinking the whole experience of Instagram to meet that commitment. We can do more to prevent bullying from happening on Instagram, and we can do more to empower the targets of bullying to stand up for themselves. Today we’re announcing one new feature in both areas. These tools are grounded in a deep understanding of how people bully each other and how they respond to bullying on Instagram, but they’re only two steps on a longer path. Encouraging Positive Interactions Online bullying is a complex issue. For years now, we have used artificial intelligence to detect bullying and other types of harmful content in comments, photos and videos. As our community grows, so does our investment in technology. This is especially crucial for teens since they are less likely to report online bullying even when they are the ones who experience it the most. In the last few days, we started rolling out a new feature powered by AI that notifies people when their comment may be considered offensive before it’s posted. This intervention gives people a chance to reflect and undo their comment and prevents the recipient from receiving the harmful comment notification. From early tests of this feature, we have found that it encourages some people to undo their comment and share something less hurtful once they have had a chance to reflect. Protecting Your Account From Unwanted Interactions With Restrict While identifying and removing bullying on Instagram is important, we also need to empower our community to stand up to this kind of behavior. We’ve heard from young people in our community that they’re reluctant to block, unfollow, or report their bully because it could escalate the situation, especially if they interact with their bully in real life. Some of these actions also make it difficult for a target to keep track of their bully’s behavior. We wanted to create a feature that allows people to control their Instagram experience, without notifying someone who may be targeting them. Soon, we will begin testing a new way to protect your account from unwanted interactions called Restrict. Once you Restrict someone, comments on your posts from that person will only be visible to that person. You can choose to make a restricted person’s comments visible to others by approving their comments. Restricted people won’t be able to see when you’re active on Instagram or when you’ve read their direct messages. It’s our responsibility to create a safe environment on Instagram. This has been an important priority for us for some time, and we are continuing to invest in better understanding and tackling this problem. I look forward to sharing more updates soon.

We’ve learned and grown a lot in this first year. In meeting with creators and viewers, we’ve heard about what they like – and what needs to be improved. In fact, that feedback has driven many of IGTV’s biggest changes so far. This includes the most important change we made this year: enabling creators to publish previews of IGTV videos to their Instagram feed, which added another way for viewers to discover IGTV videos. Since that launched February, we’ve seen viewers spending more time with IGTV and a surge of new original content from creators of all sizes. Today marks yet another change for IGTV – and it once again comes from listening to our creators and viewers. We’ve heard from creators who want to upload landscape videos for IGTV. Similarly, we’ve heard from viewers who come across landscape videos in IGTV but want to watch them in a more natural way. That’s why we’re announcing support for landscape videos in addition to vertical. Ultimately, our vision is to make IGTV a destination for great content no matter how it’s shot so creators can express themselves how they want. We realize this is an evolution from where IGTV started – we believe it’s the right change for viewers and creators. In many ways, opening IGTV to more than just vertical videos is similar to when we opened Instagram to more than just square photos in 2015. It enabled creativity to flourish and engagement to rise – and we believe the same will happen again with IGTV. For viewers, this means IGTV will be a place to watch even more content from the creators they love – and do it straight from their phone. For creators, this means more freedom to express themselves how they want. Vertical videos work great for creators who want to be up-close and personal with their audience; but landscape also has its strengths, especially when it comes to formats like dance and sports which are high motion and often feature a handful of people in frame. We want to say thank you to all the creators who are building meaningful, strong, and diverse communities and helping create the future of TV on mobile. This is just the beginning. We’ll continue to evolve to not only help you grow your communities, but build your businesses across IGTV and Instagram."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/making-explore-an-even-better-home-for-your-interests","date":"2019-05-15T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Design","Announcements"],"title":"Making Instagram Explore an Even Better Home for Your Interests","text":"People turn to Explore when they want to branch out from the accounts they already follow on Instagram.

From helping more women of color learn to code to supporting teen mental health, you can build excitement and awareness with your friends around important causes that impact your community. We’re working hard to bring the donation sticker to more of our global community in the future. To learn more, check out the Instagram Help Center here. New Camera & Create Mode Connection goes beyond sharing a photo or video — it’s also about sharing what you’re doing, thinking or feeling with the people who matter to you. In the coming weeks, we’ll introduce a new camera design including Create Mode, which gives you an easy way to share without a photo or video. This new camera will make it simpler to use popular creative tools like effects and interactive stickers, so you can express yourself more freely. The new camera and Create Mode will be rolling out globally soon. Shopping from Creators Starting next week, you can shop inspiring looks from the creators you love without leaving Instagram. Instead of taking a screenshot or asking for product details in comments or Direct, you can simply tap to see exactly what your favorite creators are wearing and buy it on the spot. From public figures and artists to entrepreneurs and publishers, creators are a cornerstone of the interest community on Instagram. They give you that spark of inspiration for a new skin care routine or that perfect denim jacket. And unlike seeing a jacket on a rack, it’s easier to relate when you see how it fits and moves on someone you admire. Anyone in our global community will be able to shop from creators. We’ll begin testing this with a small group of creators next week.

All of us at Facebook stand with the victims, their families, the Muslim community, and all of New Zealand. It is deeply tragic when people face violence because of who they are and what they believe. Over the past two weeks, the whole world has seen the compassion, unity, and resilience you have shown as a country through your grief. Many of you have also rightly questioned how online platforms such as Facebook were used to circulate horrific videos of the attack. We are committed to reviewing what happened and have been working closely with the New Zealand Police to support their response. In the immediate aftermath, we took down the terrorist’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, removed the video of the attack, and used artificial intelligence to proactively find and prevent related videos from being posted. We have heard feedback that we must do more – and we agree. In the wake of the terrorist attack, we are taking three steps: strengthening the rules for using Facebook Live, taking further steps to address hate on our platforms, and supporting the New Zealand community. First, we are exploring restrictions on who can go Live depending on factors such as prior Community Standard violations. We are also investing in research to build better technology to quickly identify edited versions of violent videos and images and prevent people from re-sharing these versions. While the original New Zealand attack video was shared Live, we know that this video spread mainly through people re-sharing it and re-editing it to make it harder for our systems to block it; we have identified more than 900 different videos showing portions of those horrifying 17 minutes. People with bad intentions will always try to get around our security measures. That’s why we must work to continually stay ahead. In the past week, we have also made changes to our review process to help us improve our response time to videos like this in the future. Second, we are taking even stronger steps to remove hate on our platforms. We have long had policies against hate groups and hate speech. We designated both shootings as terror attacks, meaning that any praise, support and representation of the events violates our Community Standards and is not permitted on Facebook. We are also using our existing artificial intelligence tools to identify and remove a range of hate groups in Australia and New Zealand, including the Lads Society, the United Patriots Front, the Antipodean Resistance, and National Front New Zealand. These groups will be banned from our services, and we will also remove praise and support of these groups when we become aware of it. And just this week we announced that we have strengthened our policies by banning praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism on Facebook and Instagram. Finally, we are standing by the people of New Zealand and providing support to four local well-being and mental health organizations to raise awareness around their services within the country. We are also working with our existing youth partner to co-design additional education around peer support and resilience. Through everything, we remain ready to work with the New Zealand Government’s Royal Commission to further review the role that online services play in these types of attacks more widely. We are also ready to work with the New Zealand Government on future regulatory models for the online industry in areas like content moderation, elections, privacy, and data portability. We know there is more work to do. We are deeply committed to strengthening our policies, improving our technology and working with experts to keep Facebook safe. We must all stand united against hate and work together to fight it wherever and whenever it occurs."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-checkout","date":"2019-03-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing Checkout on Instagram","text":"Today, we’re introducing checkout on Instagram.

Over the past month we have seen that we are not where we need to be on self-harm and suicide, and that we need to do more to keep the most vulnerable people who use Instagram safe. That’s why today, following a comprehensive review with global experts and academics on youth, mental health and suicide prevention, we’re announcing further changes to our approach on self-harm content: What’s changing We will not allow any graphic images of self-harm, such as cutting on Instagram – even if it would previously have been allowed as admission. We have never allowed posts that promote or encourage suicide or self harm, and will continue to remove it when reported.We will not show non-graphic, self-harm related content – such as healed scars – in search, hashtags and the explore tab, and we won’t be recommending it. We are not removing this type of content from Instagram entirely, as we don’t want want to stigmatize or isolate people who may be in distress and posting self-harm related content as a cry for help.We want to support people in their time of need – so we are also focused on getting more resources to people posting and searching for self-harm related content and directing them to organizations that can help.We’re continuing to consult with experts to find out what more we can do, this may include blurring any non-graphic self-harm related content with a sensitivity screen, so that images are not immediately visible. Finding the right balance Self-harm and suicide are complex issues and we rely on the input of experts in these fields to help shape our approach. Up until now, we’ve focused most of our approach on trying to help the individual who is sharing their experiences around self-harm. We have allowed content that shows contemplation or admission of self-harm because experts have told us it can help people get the support they need. But we need to do more to consider the effect of these images on other people who might see them. This is a difficult but important balance to get right. During the comprehensive reviews, the experts, including the Centre for Mental Health and Save.org reaffirmed that creating safe spaces for young people to talk about their experiences – including self-harm – online, is essential. They advised that sharing this type of content often helps people connect with support and resources that can save lives. However, collectively it was advised that graphic images of self-harm – even when it is someone admitting their struggles – has the potential to unintentionally promote self-harm. Which is why we are no longer allowing graphic images of self-harm. It will take time and we have a responsibility to get this right Our aim is to have no graphic self-harm or graphic suicide related content on Instagram and to significantly reduce – with the goal of removing – all self-harm and suicide imagery from hashtags, search, the explore tab or as recommended content, while still ensuring we support those using Instagram to connect with communities of support. We need to create a safe and supportive community for everyone – but this not as simple as just switching off a button. We will not be able to remove these images immediately and we must make sure that people posting self-harm related content do not lose their ability to express themselves and connect with help in their time of need. We will get better and we are committed to finding and removing this content at scale. We know there’s more that we can do to support the most vulnerable people who use Instagram; that’s why we’ll continue to work with experts and the wider industry to find ways to support people when they’re most in need.

For more information about each feature, visit Instagram’s Help Center. What to do if you see something that shouldn’t be on Instagram If you see something that shouldn’t be on Instagram, you can report it to us. Our team works 24/7 to quickly review and remove content that goes against our Community Guidelines. To report something, tap “…” on the top right corner of the post or profile, or swipe left on the comment. To report content in Stories, Live and IGTV, tap the “…” at the bottom of the screen. You can also report things sent to you in Direct. Just press and hold the message and tap “Report.” Keep in mind that your report is anonymous, except if you’re reporting an intellectual property infringement. The account you reported won’t see who reported them. And it only takes one report to have a photo, video, comment or message reviewed. If content is reported to us and violates our Community Guidelines, we will remove it. What to do if someone is bullying or harassing you Bullying and harassment are not allowed on Instagram, and we have tools to help protect you from negative experiences. You can block accounts that you don’t want to interact with, which means they won’t be able to see your profile or comment on your posts. When you block an account, they won’t be notified, and you can choose to unblock them at any time. You can also control comments on your posts. You can stop people from commenting on your posts altogether. We also have filters that automatically hide comments with offensive words and phrases from your posts. These filters are on by default for our global community and can be disabled in the Comment Controls center in the app. You can also bolster these filters by using our manual filter, which allows you to add your own custom list of words or emojis that you consider offensive. You can also customize who can comment on your posts — or even block comments from specific users. Go to your settings and select “Comment Controls” to access the above features. How to protect your privacy You’re in control of what you share on Instagram. You can choose to make your account private, which means you approve the people who follow you and can remove followers at any time. You can also choose who can comment on your posts, or turn off “Show Activity Status” so people can’t see when you’re online. To do this, visit the “Privacy and security” section of the settings menu. If there’s a photo or video that you no longer want anyone else to see, you can delete it by tapping “Delete” above the post, or you can archive it. Finally, for times when you only want to share your Stories with a few people, you have the option to make a close friends list on Stories and share with just the people you’ve added. To create a list, go to your profile and tap on “Close Friends” in the side menu. How to keep your account safe Losing access to your account can be a distressing experience, but there are steps you can take to protect your account from hacking. First, pick a strong password. Use a combination of at least six numbers, letters and punctuation marks (like ! and &), and do not re-use passwords that you use to log in to other services on the internet. Once you have a strong password, make your account even more secure by turning on two-factor authentication. We suggest you use a third party app, such as DUO Mobile or Google Authenticator, to secure your account. You can find instructions to set up two-factor authentication here. How to manage the amount of time you spend on Instagram To keep track of how much time you spend on Instagram, we developed an activity dashboard. To access the dashboard, go to the settings page and tap “Your Activity.” At the top of the page, you’ll see a dashboard showing the average amount of time you spend on Instagram. Tap any bar to see your total time for that day. Below the dashboard, you can set a daily reminder to send yourself an alert when you’ve reached the amount of time you want to spend on Instagram for that day. You can change or cancel the reminder at any time. You can also tap on “Notification Settings” to quickly access the new “Mute Push Notifications” setting. How to look out for each other If you’re worried about a post you see containing potential suicide or self-harm, you can anonymously report the post. The next time the person opens the app, they will see a message connecting them to support resources, such as talking to friend, contacting a helpline, or finding additional resources. These support tools also appear when a person searches for upsetting content on Instagram. Starting this week, we will also be applying sensitivity screens to some content we review that contains self-harm. These images will not be immediately visible, which will make it more difficult for people to see them. Depending on where someone is located, we have partnerships with over 40 helpline organizations around the world. If a friend or family member reports a person that they are concerned about, they’ll also be shown tips and resources to help.

Build excitement with friends while you count down to any upcoming moment, like the New Year or the end of day on a Friday. Add a countdown sticker to your story by selecting it from the sticker tray after taking a photo or video. Name your countdown, add an end date or time and customize the color before sharing to your story. After you’ve created a countdown, it will be available in your sticker tray to reuse in new stories until the countdown ends. Your friends can tap on your countdown to follow or share it to their own story; anyone who follows or shares your countdown will get a notification when the countdown ends. The countdown sticker is available globally on iOS and Android – you can learn more about it in the Instagram Help Center here.

Instagram is home to countless interests and communities; this year, ASMR was the top niche community trend of the year, with soap cutting, slime popping and makeup shaving continuing its steep rise in popularity. The game Fortnite also saw explosive growth with #fortnite being the fastest growing hashtag globally. K-pop’s dominance on social media is reflected by BTS “Army” being the top fandom community on the platform.

Every day people come to Instagram to have real experiences, including genuine interactions. It is our responsibility to ensure these experiences aren’t disrupted by inauthentic activity. Starting today, we will begin removing inauthentic likes, follows and comments from accounts that use third-party apps to boost their popularity. We’ve built machine learning tools to help identify accounts that use these services and remove the inauthentic activity. This type of behavior is bad for the community, and third-party apps that generate inauthentic likes, follows and comments violate our Community Guidelines and Terms of Use. We’re taking a number of steps to limit this kind of unwelcome behavior. Accounts we identify using these services will receive an in-app message alerting them that we have removed the inauthentic likes, follows and comments given by their account to others. We will also ask them to secure their account by changing their password. People who use these types of apps share their username and password, and their accounts are sometimes used by third-party apps for inauthentic likes, follows and comments. Not only does this introduce bad behavior into the Instagram community, it also makes these accounts less secure. We also know some people may have unknowingly shared their login credentials with a third-party app. If you receive an in-app message, simply change your password to revoke their access to your account. These new measures will be ongoing, and accounts that continue to use third-party apps to grow their audience may see their Instagram experience impacted. Since the early days of Instagram, we have auto-detected and removed fake accounts to protect our community.

Shop on business profiles We’re also testing a redesign of the Shop tab on business profiles so you can quickly view all the products featured in their shopping posts. When you visit a business profile, tap on the ‘Shop’ button to see their products, such as the item name, price, and the post featuring the item. It’s a great way to browse all the products from a brand you love on Instagram, in one place. Shopping in Feed videos You can now shop in videos from your favorite brands. When you see a video in Feed from a brand you follow, tap the shopping icon in the bottom left corner to reveal the featured products and learn more about them. Whether you’re treating yourself or shopping for loved ones, these updates unlock new ways to discover and connect with the brands and products that inspire you."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/sharing-your-election-day-excitement-on-instagram","date":"2018-10-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing The \"I Voted\" & \"We Voted\" Stickers","text":"For Election Day, we’re introducing two new ways for people in the US to share their voting excitement on Instagram: an “I Voted” sticker and a “We Voted!” story at the front of your stories bar. We’ve seen our community use Instagram to share that they voted with friends and family — and we’re thrilled to make this even easier and more expressive. Starting Sunday, you’ll be able to use a new “I Voted” sticker. Open the camera, take a proud selfie, tap the sticker icon and select the “I Voted” sticker from the tray. If your phone language is set to Spanish, you’ll see the “Yo Voté” version. After you use the “I Voted” sticker, your friends can tap the sticker in your story to find their polling location via Get to the Polls, a nonpartisan site. On Election Day on November 6th, you will see a “We Voted!” story at the front of your stories bar when several of your friends post a story with the “I Voted” sticker. Simply tap the “We Voted!” story to see your friends’ voting excitement all in one place. This functionality is new to Instagram, and provides a way for you to see the people you follow share a moment together in Stories. We’re excited to bring this feature to the community in new ways in the future. Both the “I Voted” sticker and “We Voted!” story will be available throughout Election Day in the US."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/anti-bullying-tools-on-instagram","date":"2018-10-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements","Safety"],"title":"New Anti-Bullying Tools on Instagram","text":"There is no place for bullying on Instagram. If people see that kind of hurtful behavior on our platform, they can report it, and we remove any content that violates our guidelines. But online bullying is complex, and we know we have more work to do to further limit bullying and spread kindness on Instagram. That’s why today we’re announcing our latest tools to help combat bullying, including a new way to identify and report bullying in photos. We’re also introducing a camera effect to help spread kindness in Stories. As the new Head of Instagram, I’m proud to build on our commitment to making Instagram a kind and safe community for everyone. Detecting Bullying in Photos While the majority of photos shared on Instagram are positive and bring people joy, occasionally a photo is shared that is unkind or unwelcome. We are now using machine learning technology to proactively detect bullying in photos and their captions and send them to our Community Operations team to review. This change will help us identify and remove significantly more bullying — and it’s a crucial next step since many people who experience or observe bullying don’t report it. It will also help us protect our youngest community members since teens experience higher rates of bullying online than others. This new technology has begun to roll out and will continue to in the coming weeks. Bullying Comment Filter on Live Videos A few months ago, we introduced a bullying comment filter to proactively detect and hide bullying comments from Feed, Explore and Profile. We’re now adding this filter to comments on live videos to ensure that Live remains a safe and fun place to authentically connect with your friends and interests. This is now globally available for all live videos. Kindness Camera Effect While stopping bullies is important, we must also do more to celebrate and inspire kindness on Instagram. Together with New York Times best-selling teen author, dancer and actor, Maddie Ziegler, we’re launching a kindness camera effect to spread positivity. Maddie has been speaking out against online bullying since she started experiencing it and is one of many people in our community that uses Instagram to promote positivity. If you follow Maddie, you will have the camera effect automatically. Swipe to open the camera, tap the face icon at the bottom and choose the new camera effect. In selfie mode, hearts will fill the screen — and you’ll be encouraged to tag a friend you want to support. Your friend will receive a notification that you mentioned them in your story. They can share it to their own story or use the camera effect to spread kindness to someone else. If you switch to the rear camera, you’ll see an overlay of kind comments in many languages. If you aren’t a follower of Maddie but you see someone else with the effect, tap “try it” to add it to your camera. Learn more about our camera effects here. In honor of National Bullying Prevention Month in the US, the upcoming Anti-Bullying Week in the UK and anti-bullying efforts around the world, we are pleased to announce these new ways to combat bullying on our platform.

To make connecting and sharing with friends even easier, we’re globally launching nametag, an easy way to add friends in person. We’re also testing a new Instagram school communities feature in the US to help students connect with others from their university right in the app. Whether you’re finding other fans at the football game or meeting classmates in your study group, both nametag and school communities make it easier to connect with new people. Introducing Nametag Nametag is a customizable identification card that allows people to find your Instagram profile when it’s scanned. Your nametag is uniquely yours and makes it quick and fun to add people and accounts you discover in person. To try out nametag, go to your profile, tap the button with three lines at the top, and select “Nametag.” You can personalize your nametag by touching anywhere on the screen or by tapping the button at the top to try other designs, such as colors, emojis and selfies with different stickers. To scan someone’s nametag, you can either swipe right into the camera, hover over the nametag and hold down on your screen, or enter the camera by tapping “Scan a nametag” when viewing your own. You can also share your nametag with friends through text messages and over other platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp. Just press the arrow at the top right of your nametag. Testing School Communities Instagram school communities let you show off your school spirit and connect with other students and recent grads from your university in a common space. We’re testing this feature in a variety of schools across the US. If you choose to join, you can add a line to your profile listing your university, class year, and any relevant groups such as major, sports team, and sorority. You and others who’ve added the same university can click to go to a directory listing all the people—sorted by class year—who have added that university, where you can follow and message. Messages from people you don’t already follow will go to your pending inbox where you can choose to accept or decline—the same way Instagram Direct works today. Nametag is available globally on both Android and iOS starting today – to learn more, check out the Instagram Help Center. School communities is currently testing in some US universities and we’ll continue to bring the experience to more in the coming weeks."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/adam-mosseri-announced-as-new-head-of-instagram","date":"2018-09-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"New Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri Announced","text":"We are pleased to announce that Adam Mosseri, our current Vice President of Product, will become the Head of Instagram starting today.

In his role leading Instagram, Adam will oversee all functions of the business and will recruit a new executive team including a head of engineering, head of product and head of operations. Since we announced our departure, many people have asked us what we hope for the future of Instagram.

That’s why we’ve created A Parent’s Guide, a new resource for parents with teens who use Instagram. We’ve always been focused on making sure the community on Instagram is supportive and safe, and we’ve been building tools to proactively care for the people who use our products. Tools like comment controls, the ability to report unwanted interactions, and most recently, a suite of features to help you manage time on the app were all developed to help ensure people’s experience with Instagram is positive, safe and intentional. In A Parent’s Guide, we focus on three things: how to manage privacy, interactions and time on Instagram. We’ve included the basics of our app, and a description of our tools, plus a discussion guide for how parents and guardians can have an open conversation with their teens about Instagram. The discussion questions were developed in collaboration with education and social media expert, Ana Homayoun, M.A., P.P.S., and are designed to help parents and guardians learn more about how teens are using Instagram and to ensure they’re using the app in a positive way. We’re grateful to organizations like the National PTA, Scholastic, ConnectSafely, National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI), National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA), GLSEN, Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, PFLAG, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, Girl Scouts of the USA, and PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center for collaborating with us on this guide.

First, we’re announcing a new feature to help you evaluate the authenticity of accounts with large followings on Instagram; we’re also launching a global verification form for notable public figures; and finally, we’re announcing an improved form of two-factor authentication that makes it easier and safer for you to securely log into Instagram. Our mission is to bring you closer to the people and things you love. That closeness can only happen if Instagram is a safe place. As the CTO of Instagram, keeping people with bad intentions off our platform is incredibly important to me. That means trying to make sure the people you follow and the accounts you interact with are who they say they are, and stopping bad actors before they cause harm. “About This Account” In the coming weeks, you will be able to see more information about accounts on Instagram that reach large audiences so you can evaluate the authenticity of the account. To learn more about an account, go to their Profile, tap the … menu and then select “About This Account.” There, you will see the date the account joined Instagram, the country where the account is located, accounts with shared followers, any username changes in the last year and any ads the account is currently running. Our community has told us that it’s important to them to have a deeper understanding of accounts that reach many people on Instagram, particularly when those accounts are sharing information related to current events, political or social causes, for example. If you do see an account on Instagram you believe violates our Community Guidelines, you can report it. In September, people who have accounts that reach large audiences can review the information about their accounts that will soon be publicly available. After that, the “About This Account” tool will be available to the global community. Increasing Access to Verification In addition to the “About This Account” feature, the blue verified badge is an important way for you to know that the account you are interacting with is the authentic presence of a notable public figure, celebrity, global brand or entity. Today we are enabling a new way for accounts that reach large audiences and meet our criteria to request verification through a form within the Instagram app. To be verified, an account must comply with Instagram’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. We will review verification requests to confirm the authenticity, uniqueness, completeness and notability of each account. Visit the Help Center to learn more about Instagram’s verification criteria. To access the verification request form, go to your profile, tap the menu icon, select “Settings” at the bottom and then choose “Request Verification.” You will need to provide your account username, your full name and a copy of your legal or business identification. This information will not be shared publicly. Submitting a request for verification does not guarantee that your account will be verified. Once your request has been reviewed, you will receive a notification confirming or declining your request in the notifications tab. Instagram will never request payment for verification or reach out to ask you to confirm your verification. Support for Third-Party Authenticator Apps Finally, soon you will soon be able to use third-party authenticator apps to log into your Instagram account. This form of two-factor authentication makes it easier and safer for you to securely log into Instagram. To use a third-party app to log into your Instagram account, go to your profile, tap the menu icon, select “Settings” at the bottom and then choose “Two-Factor Authentication.” Select “Authentication App” as your preferred form of authentication. If you already have an authentication app installed, we will automatically find the app and send a login code to it. Go to the app, retrieve the code and enter it on Instagram, and two-factor authentication will turn on automatically. If you don’t have one installed yet, we will send you to the App Store or Google Play Store to download the authenticator app of your choice. Once you’ve installed it, return to Instagram to continue setting up your two-factor authentication. Support for third-party authenticator apps has begun to roll out and will be available to the global community in the coming weeks. I founded Instagram alongside Kevin nearly eight years ago, and we care deeply about this community and the people who are part of it. We’ve been focused on the safety of our platform since the very beginning, and today’s updates build upon our existing tools, such as our spam and abusive content filters and the ability to report or block accounts. We know we have more work to do to keep bad actors off Instagram, and we are committed to continuing to build more tools to do just that.

We developed these tools based on collaboration and inspiration from leading mental health experts and organizations, academics, our own extensive research and feedback from our community. We want the time people spend on Instagram and Facebook to be intentional, positive and inspiring. Our hope is that these tools give people more control over the time they spend on our platforms and also foster conversations between parents and teens about the online habits that are right for them. To access the tools, go to the settings page on either app. On Instagram, tap “Your Activity,” and on Facebook, tap “Your Time on Facebook.” At the top, you’ll see a dashboard showing your average time for that app on that device. Tap any bar to see your total time for that day. Below the dashboard, you can set a daily reminder to give yourself an alert when you’ve reached the amount of time you want to spend on that app for that day. You can change or cancel the reminder at any time. You can also tap on “Notification Settings” to quickly access the new “Mute Push Notifications” setting. This will limit your Instagram or Facebook notifications for a period of time when you need to focus. We have a responsibility to help people understand how much time they spend on our platforms so they can better manage their experience. In December 2017, we shared insights about what the team at Facebook is doing to create experiences that help people connect and build relationships. Additional Tools Although we have more work to do, over the past year, we’ve introduced a number of tools to help people better control their experience on Instagram and Facebook. On Facebook, we improved News Feed quality to show people the most relevant posts with features like See First, Hide, Unfollow, and Keyword Snooze. On Instagram, we launched powerful tools to proactively care for the community — like the “You’re All Caught Up” message in Feed, keyword filtering, sensitivity screens, and offensive comment and bullying filters. We also have an ongoing, global commitment to suicide prevention, including the expansion of proactive detection and improvement of first responder identification. Our approach was developed in collaboration with mental health organizations such as Save.org and with input from people who have had personal experience thinking about or attempting suicide. Community Outreach In March, we convened our Facebook Safety Summit, with more than 100 organizations, researchers, experts and teens to talk about a wide range of topics — from issues of safety and technology, to how tech is impacting our well-being. We’ve also partnered with Scholastic and Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence to develop and launch “Best Selves” social and emotional learning curriculum designed to give teachers easy to use lessons that help students develop pro-social behaviors; and worked with Stand for Children, Harvard’s Making Caring Common and other experts to develop “kindness” curriculum and launch Kind Schools Challenge, which enrolls middle schools in teaching 30 days of kindness curriculum. It’s not just about the time people spend on Instagram and Facebook but how they spend that time. It’s our responsibility to talk openly about how time online impacts people — and we take that responsibility seriously. These new tools are an important first step, and we are committed to continuing our work to foster safe, kind and supportive communities for everyone. These updates are rolling out soon on Instagram and Facebook."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/best-igtv-videos-on-instagram-this-month","date":"2018-07-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Creators","Announcements"],"title":"Best IGTV Videos on Instagram this Month","text":"One month ago, we started a new chapter of mobile video with the introduction of IGTV, a new app and space within Instagram where people can watch long-form (up to an hour) vertical videos from their favorite Instagram creators and celebs.

These updates — including Video Chat, topic channels in Explore, and new camera effects for Stories — are rolling out today. Video Chat in Instagram Direct Now, you can video chat in Instagram Direct, either with just one person or a group. Video chat gives you the experience of realtime video in a private space and helps you feel close and connected to friends when you can’t be together. Your friends are already on Instagram, and with video chat, you can seamlessly connect across iOS and Android and without a phone number. To start a video chat, swipe into your Direct inbox and open any message thread. Tap the new camera icon in the right corner, and the video chat will ring your friends’ phones so they don’t miss it. While on the video chat, you can minimize the video and multitask on Instagram, sending messages and photos in Direct, browsing your feed, posting a story and more. Video chat is perfect for groups. You can video chat with up to four people at a time, and the video will expand as more friends join. If there’s an active video chat in a group thread, the camera icon will turn blue. Simply tap the camera to join in the fun. You can video chat with your friends for as long as you’d like. When you’re ready to leave the video chat, tap the red phone icon at the bottom. You can video chat with anyone you have an active Direct thread with. If you block a person, they will no longer be able to video chat you. You can also mute a person if you don’t want to receive notifications from them. To update your video chat notifications, tap the gear icon on profile and find the new video chat control in Push Notifications. Topic Channels on Explore Topic channels on Explore give you new ways to discover your interests on Instagram. Over 200 million people visit Explore every day to discover new ideas and find inspiration. Now it’s even easier to browse through posts you want to see and accounts you want to follow. With topic channels, you can be more intentional about how you navigate posts on Explore. When you open the page, you’ll see a tray at the top with personalized channels. This includes a ‘For You’ channel, which has a mix of posts tailored to your interests. You’ll also see channels on topics you might like such as Art, Sports, Beauty or Fashion – as well as a list of hashtags, giving you more ways to explore your interests. Now, when you want to get inspired by the latest fashion trends or discover a new travel destination, you can easily find posts you’re looking for and follow those accounts or hashtags. We’re also giving you better ways to control what you see on Explore. You can browse through a variety of interests by swiping from grid to grid, or you can go deep into a specific interest by tapping on a channel and scrolling up. If you’d like to remove a topic channel, press and hold the channel and select ‘Mute’ from the menu. This sends the channel to the end of the tray, giving you the option to unmute it at any time. New Camera Effects Lastly, you’ll now see the first batch of new camera effects designed by Ariana Grande, Buzzfeed, Liza Koshy, Baby Ariel and NBA in the Instagram camera. Whether you want to make your friends laugh or add some glam to your selfies, you now have more ways to express yourself and feel closer to your favorite accounts. You’ll see a new effect in your Instagram camera if you follow any of these accounts — just tap the face icon at the bottom right corner. If you aren’t a follower but you see an effect that you love, you can tap to try it on and add it to your camera. This is just the beginning. We’re excited to bring new effects from more of your favorite accounts to Instagram soon. All of these features are available on Android and iOS starting today."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/welcome-to-igtv","date":"2018-06-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Welcome to IGTV, our New Video App","text":"Update: We launched IGTV at an event in San Francisco featuring many of the Instagram creators who’ll make IGTV great. Check out the video of the event to learn what IGTV is, how it works and see it come to life. Today, we have two big announcements to share. First, Instagram is now a global community of one billion! Since our launch in 2010, we’ve watched with amazement as the community has flourished and grown. This is a major accomplishment — so from all of us at Instagram, thank you! Second, we’re announcing our most exciting feature to date: IGTV, a new app for watching long-form, vertical video from your favorite Instagram creators, like LaurDIY posting her newest project or King Bach sharing his latest comedy skit. While there’s a stand-alone IGTV app, you’ll also be able to watch from within the Instagram app so the entire community of one billion can use it from the very start. IGTV is different in a few ways. First, it’s built for how you actually use your phone, so videos are full screen and vertical. Also, unlike on Instagram, videos aren’t limited to one minute. Instead, each video can be up to an hour long. We’ve made it simple, too. Just like turning on the TV, IGTV starts playing as soon as you open the app. You don’t have to search to start watching content from people you already follow on Instagram and others you might like based on your interests. You can swipe up to discover more — switch between “For You,” “Following,” “Popular” and “Continue Watching.” You can also like, comment and send videos to friends in Direct. Also like TV, IGTV has channels. But, in IGTV, the creators are the channels. When you follow a creator on Instagram, their IGTV channel will show up for you to watch. Anyone can be a creator — you can upload your own IGTV videos in the app or on the web to start your own channel. Instagram has always been a place to connect with the people who inspire, educate and entertain you every day. With your help, IGTV begins a new chapter of video on Instagram. We hope it brings you closer to the people and things you love. Kevin Systrom, Co-Founder & CEO IGTV will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks on Android and iOS. You can learn more by visiting the Instagram Help Center."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-shopping-on-instagram-stories","date":"2018-06-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing Shopping Stickers to Instagram Stories","text":"Today we’re beginning to expand shopping beyond Feed to Instagram Stories.

Instagram is a home for diverse youth activism and expression, and to help knit the community closer together, we gathered together five young leaders from the LGBTQ+ community in real life and surprised them with their role models for a conversation about their lives, their work and how they inspire people to be open and connect with others. Check out the video above to hear stories and reactions from ALOK and Sasha Velour, Blair Imani and Bethany C.

In Live, each time you tap the heart, you’ll see a different color of the Pride rainbow — and holding down will send a shower of rainbow hearts to the person you’re watching as well as everyone who’s watching along with you. And, finally, we worked with GLAAD to identify hashtags that people throughout the LGBTQ+ community gather around and use to connect with one another. Throughout Pride month, you’ll see a rainbow gradient on those hashtags everywhere they appear to encourage more people to discover and explore the photos and videos from people throughout the community.Instagram is committed to fostering a safer, kinder and more inclusive community.

You can always unmute an account to get their posts back in your feed. To mute an account, tap the … menu in the corner of the post. From there, you can choose whether to mute posts, or mute posts and stories from an account. You can also mute posts and stories by pressing and holding on a story in your tray, or from a profile.

By choosing an emoji for your question, you also add a layer of emotional context that helps those answering understand your tone and answer accordingly. To add an emoji slider sticker to your story, select it from the sticker tray after taking a photo or video. Place it anywhere you’d like and write out your question. Then, set the emoji that best matches your question’s mood. You can pick from a few of the most popular emoji, or choose almost any emoji from your library if you have something specific in mind. Like with the poll sticker, friends and followers will be able to respond to your slider as soon as you’ve shared it. When you see an emoji slider in a story, just drag the emoji to the left or right and watch it animate as you make your decision. Release the emoji to set your response, and you’ll see the current average of how others have responded so far.

To be clear: we don’t tolerate bullying on Instagram. Our Community Guidelines have always prohibited bullying on our platform, and I’m proud to announce this next step in our ongoing commitment to keeping Instagram an inclusive, supportive place for all voices. Last year we announced our offensive comment filter, which automatically hides toxic and divisive comments, particularly those aimed at at-risk groups. This new filter hides comments containing attacks on a person’s appearance or character, as well as threats to a person’s well-being or health. The bullying filter is on for our global community and can be disabled in the Comment Controls center in the app. The new filter will also alert us to repeated problems so we can take action. To learn more about our comment filters and how to customize the comments on your posts, visit the Instagram Help Center. We are also expanding our policies to guard against bullying young public figures on our platform. Protecting our youngest community members is crucial to helping them feel comfortable to express who they are and what they care about. We also believe in promoting kindness — encouraging our community to support one another both on and off Instagram. On Saturday we will host a Kindness Prom to celebrate people in our community who are spreading positivity. These young leaders are inspiring their peers by helping kindness, acceptance and support grow on Instagram and in the world.

Stories Highlights is a new part of your profile where you can express more of who you are through stories you’ve shared.

Stories Highlights Over the past year, Instagram Stories has become a key part of how you express yourself — but there hasn’t been an easy way to keep your stories around for more than 24 hours. Now you can more fully express your identity by grouping stories you’ve shared into highlights and featuring them on your profile. Stories Highlights appear in a new section on your profile below your bio. To create a highlight, tap the “New” circle at the far left. From there, you can choose any stories from your archive, select a cover for your highlight and give it a name. Once you’re done, your highlight will appear as a circle on your profile that plays as a stand-alone story when someone taps it. Highlights stay on your profile until you remove them, and you can have as many highlights as you’d like. To edit or remove a highlight, just tap and hold that highlight on your profile. Story Highlights lets you show all the sides of your personality, and you can make highlights out of anything you’ve shared to your story in the past. From the best moments of your ongoing soccer season to all the stories you capture of your loved ones, the interests and activities that matter most to you have a home right on your profile. Stories Archive Moving forward, your stories will automatically save to your archive when they expire. This makes it easy for you to revisit your favorite moments later on or bring them back to life in a highlight. To access the stories in your archive, tap the Archive icon on your profile. From there, you can easily switch between your Posts Archive and your new Stories Archive. In your Stories Archive, your stories will appear in a grid with the most recent stories at the bottom. The first story from each day will show a date indicator to help you navigate your archive as you scroll. Tap on any story in your archive to watch it. From there, you can add it to your story, share it as a post or add it to a highlight on your profile. Only you can see your archived stories, and you can choose to turn off auto-archiving at any time in your profile settings.

That’s up from 15 million in July. As 800 million use Instagram each month to discover and follow their passions, more and more people are using it to connect with businesses they love. In fact, over 80% of accounts on Instagram follow a business,[1] while 200 million Instagrammers actively visit the profile of a business every day.[2] As a result, the Instagram community is helping spur small business growth in big ways. “Two-thirds of profile visits to businesses come from people who aren’t following that business.” – Instagram data, Nov 2017 Through the visual content they share, businesses are making valuable connections and sparking conversations with people like never before. Instagram is increasingly becoming the primary digital presence for these businesses—like shoe retailer AMAZARA (@amazara.id). Based in Indonesia, AMAZARA uses Instagram as its primary channel for engaging with customers. Through eye-catching posts, Instagram Stories and Direct, the stylish brand has been able to grow its business to over 70 employees in just two years. And that’s because Instagram is no longer considered just a stop along the mobile journey. With one in three small businesses on Instagram saying they built their business on Instagram,[3] it’s become a destination where businesses are not only discovered, but where business is done. With the expansion of shopping on Instagram to even more businesses in the US, we’re seeing retailers like Man Outfitters (@manoutfitters), WYLDER (@wyldergoods) and Letterfolk (@letterfolk) use shopping tags to help people discover new products they love. And with new insights,[4] businesses will now be able to see exactly how they’re being discovered on Instagram—whether through feed, location tags, hashtags or explore. “When you only have milliseconds to capture the attention of your customers organically, the ability to directly connect them with products that pique their interest is priceless. Customers who follow business accounts for quality content can now easily be guided to products without disrupting their natural browsing habits, and even those with little interest in promotions can’t help but take notice. We no longer have to deal with customers commenting ‘Where can I find this shirt?’ on a promotional post—everything they need to find their product is right there with shopping on Instagram.” – Joe Nullet, VP of Branding & Marketing, Man Outfitters The holidays are the busiest and most crucial time of year for small businesses everywhere. That’s why we’re sharing resources for small businesses with tips and tricks on how to use Instagram this holiday season—including answers to frequently asked questions on how to best leverage your business profile. Businesses from all over are turning to Instagram as a one-stop visual shop, given its image-first, look and feel.

Since the beginning, we’ve tried to make Instagram a welcoming place for everyone. Our community has grown to 800 million, with 500 million using it every day. It’s more important than ever to strengthen our commitment to safety and kindness. Comment Controls Over time, we’ve launched a number of tools to help you manage the comments experience, and today we’re introducing more. Starting today, if your account is public, you’ll see a new way to choose who can comment on your posts — from everyone to just groups of people, like people you follow or your followers. Also, whether your account is public or private, you’ll be able to block other accounts from commenting on your posts. In June, we launched a filter to block certain offensive comments in English, today we are expanding this filter to Arabic, French, German, and Portuguese. The filter will improve over time, enabling the community’s experience of sharing to improve as well. Anonymous Reporting for Live Video We’re continuing to provide mental health resources to you when you need them most. If you see someone going through a difficult time or in need of support during a live broadcast, you can report it anonymously. The person will see a message offering help with options to talk to a helpline, reach out to a friend or get other tips and support. We have teams working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, around the world to respond. Kindness Walls and Stickers Over the next few months, we’re turning walls in cities around the world into colorful murals inspiring #KindComments. Visit a wall, take a photo or video and share a #KindComment to make someone’s day. You can also participate by using a new kindness-themed heart-shaped sticker. Both the murals and stickers are created by artists from the global community. We feel as strongly about creating a safe and welcoming environment today as we did when our community was just getting started. To learn more about these tools and others, visit about.instagram.com/community. Thank you for being on this journey with us, and for taking care of each other.

These tools are the next step in our commitment to foster kind, inclusive communities on Instagram. Blocking Offensive Comments Many of you have told us that toxic comments discourage you from enjoying Instagram and expressing yourself freely. To help, we’ve developed a filter that will block certain offensive comments on posts and in live video. All other comments will appear as they normally do and you can still report comments, delete comments or turn them off. Also, you can always turn this filter off. To access it, click the “…” settings menu from the profile and scroll to tap “Comments.” We’ll launch this comment filter in English first, but will offer it in more languages over time. Reducing spam in Comments The spam filter looks for any obvious spam in comments, blocking it from your posts and live videos. The filter will remove spam written in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, French, German, Russian, Japanese and Chinese. Powered by machine learning, today’s filters are our latest tools to keep Instagram a safe place. Our team has been training our systems for some time to recognize certain types of offensive and spammy comments so you never have to see them. The tools will improve over time, enabling the community’s experience of sharing to improve as well. We hope to make these filters available in more languages as our algorithms improve. We believe that using machine learning to build tools to safeguard self-expression is an important step in fostering more inclusive, kinder communities. Our work is far from finished and perfect, but I hope we’re helping you feel safer and more welcome on Instagram.

From advanced account security to comment tools, we’ve rounded up the top tips and tricks, both on and off Instagram, to keep your account and your community safe. Use two-factor authentication to log in to Instagram safely Two-factor authentication is a new security feature that helps safeguard your account by requiring something you know (your account username and password) and something you have (your mobile phone) every time you log into your Instagram account from an unknown device. Meaning, if someone has your password but does not have your phone, they cannot access your account. Here are step-by-step instructions. Choose who sees your posts with a private account By default, each Instagram account is visible to the entire community. Switching to a private account allows you to control who sees your content. With a private account, you can also remove followers without blocking them (see tip #3). Setting your account to private is simple – navigate to the “Settings” gear from your profile page, and toggle “Private Account” to the “on” position. From there, you will need to approve every follow request moving forward. Block anyone you don’t want to see your posts Even if you don’t have a private account, you can still control who can find and follow you on Instagram by using the blocking tool. To block an account, navigate to that account’s profile, open the “…” menu in the upper right corner and tap “Block User.” The account user won’t receive a notification that you blocked them. While the user will still be able to mention your username on Instagram, this mention won’t appear in your Activity. If you change your username after you block them, they won’t be able to mention you unless they know your new username. Control the comments you want to see Comments are where the majority of conversation happens on Instagram, so it’s important for you to feel comfortable with the comments on your posts. Last year we added the ability to filter comments based on chosen keywords or default keywords we have identified. Check out how to filter your comments here. A few more tips: If you see a comment you don’t want on your post, you can delete it by swiping left and tapping the trash icon.If you want to disable all comments on a post, tap “Advanced Settings” before you post, and toggle “Turn Off Commenting” to the “On” position. Want to turn off commenting on an older post? Change the status of comments on any post, at any time, by tapping the “…” menu after you’ve posted. Pick a strong password and keep it safe Choose a password that is difficult to guess by using a combination of at least six numbers, letters and symbols (like ! and &amp;) and make sure it is unique to Instagram.Never post or share your password with anyone you don’t trust, including any third-party app. Instagram conducts automated security checks and will prompt you to change your password if it appears compromised. If this happens to you, respond to Instagram’s notification by changing your password right away.When you share a computer or phone with others, remember to log out of your Instagram and make sure not to check the “Remember Me” box! For added security, use a lock code on your phone to ensure no one can access your account if your phone is lost. Report any abuse, bullying, harassment or impersonation We want to ensure all content on Instagram is lawful and follows our Community Guidelines. If you see something questionable or a post you believe violates our guidelines, report it! Here’s how: Lastly, if you believe someone is impersonating you or someone you know on Instagram, fill out this form. To report a comment, swipe to the left and tap the arrow.To report a specific post or an account, tap the “…” menu and then “Report.” Or, you can also fill out this form online and the Instagram review team will determine if the comment, post or account should be taken down. Support a friend in need If you see someone posting content about suicide or self-injury and think immediate action needs to be taken, contact local law enforcement right away. If the threat of physical danger isn’t immediate, report the content within the app by tapping the “…” menu next to any post and tapping “It’s inappropriate.” Select the “Self Injury” option. Reach out to your friend over the phone, over Direct message, or in person to check in. View more resources in the Instagram Help Center.

Whether you’re sitting on the couch at home or out and about, face filters help you express yourself and have playful conversations with friends. From math equations swirling around your head to furry koala ears that move and twitch, you can transform into a variety of characters that make you smile or laugh. To see our initial set of eight face filters, simply open the camera and tap the new face icon in the bottom right corner. Tap a filter to try it on, and keep an eye out for ones that work with a friend. Take a photo or video using the front or back-facing camera — they even work with Boomerang, so you can easily add an unexpected twist to what you share! When you’re done recording, you can send it to your best friends through Instagram Direct or add it to your story. And more! Also today, we’re rolling out more creative tools in the camera. You can make videos that play in reverse with “Rewind,” a new camera format next to “Boomerang” and “Hands-Free.” Drop a microphone and watch it fly up into your hand. Capture a fountain in motion and share a rewind of the water floating back up. Experiment with some magic tricks of your own and defy the laws of physics wherever you are. You can also add more context to your story with a new hashtag sticker. Just tap the sticker icon at the top right of your screen, select and customize the hashtag, then add it to your story. Like with mentions, you can add hashtags using regular text as well. People watching your story will be able to tap the hashtag sticker or text to visit the hashtag page and explore related posts. Lastly, you'll see a new eraser brush when using drawing tools. You can erase other things you've drawn and play around with removing color. After you've taken a photo or video, select a drawing tool and tap and hold to fill the entire screen with color. Then, using the eraser brush, you can creatively reveal parts of your photo or video underneath. From the very first photo filter to Boomerang and more, Instagram has always been the place you can go to turn regular moments into something you can’t wait to share. Now, you have more fun and easy ways to express yourself and connect with the people you care about most. To learn more about today’s updates, check out the Instagram Help Center.

Mental illness can affect anyone, and according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, in the United States alone half of all chronic mental illness begins by the age of 14. Every day on Instagram, we see people share their mental health journeys and connect with communities of support. From dedicated accounts around an issue to unique hashtags adopted by groups, these communities are helping to make illnesses that are often invisible to friends and family visible through photos and videos. We are committed to fostering a safer, kinder community and highlighting these inspiring voices. For the video above, we sat down with three people who have created communities on Instagram that offer much-needed support to others. This month, we’ll be using our own platform to show the video above to people all over the world, helping to raise awareness about mental health and the importance of finding support. In addition to highlighting powerful voices, we are working to protect our community. In September, we announced new resources to connect people to vital mental health resources near them. If you see a post on Instagram from someone who may be in need of mental health support, you can report it anonymously. The next time that person logs into the app, we will connect them to organizations in their country that offer help. We have teams working 24 hours a day, seven days a week to review these reports. We also display these resources when someone visits a hashtag page for a sensitive topic. Beyond building better tools inside the app, we also work closely with organizations such as Crisis Text Line, National Eating Disorder Association and Samaritans. I am inspired by the empowering voices on Instagram and how our community supports one another. If you or someone you love is currently struggling, visit instagram-together.com to find resources in your country.

Now, with these new sticker tools, you have even more ways to turn your most casual, everyday moments into something fun to share. Selfie Sticker and Pinning Turn your selfie into a sticker so you can quickly share your reaction or trade faces with someone (or something) in your story. When you take a photo or video and tap the smiley face, you’ll see a new sticker with a camera icon that lets you capture a mini-selfie. Before or after capturing, tap to apply different frame styles: fade or circle. Put your selfie sticker anywhere, adjust the size and use as many other creative tools as you want. You can also take your selfie sticker to the next level by pinning it to a specific spot in your video. Just tap and hold the sticker, move it over any object and confirm by tapping “Pin.” Pinning works with any sticker and text, and it’s extra fun with Boomerang and hands-free video. You can even pin multiple things in the same video. Geostickers in Four New Cities If you live in or are traveling to Chicago, London, Madrid, or Tokyo, you’ll also start seeing geostickers for your city over the coming days.

We introduced Instagram Stories—a new way for businesses to share everyday moments—video exploded, we welcomed a new brand identity and the community grew to more than 600M globally. At the same time, we were building a thriving business. We now have 8M businesses using business profiles, with the greatest adoption coming from the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and the United Kingdom. We also have more than 1M monthly active advertisers—up from 200K this time last year—and, in the last month, over 120M Instagrammers visited a website, got directions, called, emailed or direct messaged to learn about a business.How Businesses Grow on Instagram The community rallies around passions. People come to Instagram to follow their passions, from travel and fashion to food, entertainment and everything in between. And those passions extend to brands, with 80% of Instagrammers following a business today.Simplicity matters. Tools like Boomerang and Hyperlapse help people and businesses quickly develop compelling content. And with a mobile-first platform, placing an ad is easy too. It takes as little as four taps to create an ad from a business profile.Visible Action. The majority of advertisers and those using business tools are small businesses, like Shari Lott, CEO and Founder of SpearmintLOVE, which is a far-reaching website for infant and toddler clothing and accessories. “Instagram gave us a chance to grow the business. From the beginning it was a community of fellow moms to help get the word out, then it was buyers tagging us in photos of products they think we’d like for the store, to increasing sales through ads that reach people that were interested but had yet to buy.” Then there’s Suann Song, founder and creative designer of Appointed, a paper goods company based in Washington, D.C. A designer at heart, Suann was inspired by paper she came across in her travels and decided to create her own line in 2015. The company started on Instagram by building awareness for its Kickstarter campaign. Most recently, to celebrate its second birthday, Appointed posted a product exclusive on Instagram using a multi-image post and then selected the best performing creative for an ad, nearly selling out the product. Appointed now offers more than 50 products and is available in 300 stores. “Of all the tools we use, Instagram’s been instrumental in everything we do,” says Song, “and Instagram will play an important part in how we double our revenue this year.”Deepening the relationship between people and businesses This year we plan to do more to help people meaningfully connect with businesses they care about on Instagram. We’re starting with more insights on stories, posts saved, and multi-post images so businesses like Matchaeologist, a luxury matcha brand, can continue to gain perspective on its followers. Matchaeologist founders shared, “Insights have given us a new perspective on our followers – we thought many were based in the UK but found a significant number are in Hong Kong and Taiwan. We now post our content earlier so we can catch people before they go to bed. As a result, we’ve seen an increase in engagement and sales from those regions, helping us take our business to more people around the world.” And it’s more than just insights that is helping the business… the company is also seeing a lot of people contact them through their profile. “Since switching to a business profile on Instagram, the number of people contacting us directly has increased; by phone, on email and via direct message.”To help Matchaeolgist, along with millions of other businesses all around the world, we plan to continue evolving Instagram business profiles. For example, we’ll roll out the ability to book a service with a business directly from their profile later this year.View a preview of our booking feature below:Video created by origami artist and Instagrammer @white_onrice."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-geostickers-for-sao-paulo","date":"2017-03-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Design","Announcements"],"title":"New Geostickers for Sau Paulo","text":"Today, we’re introducing geostickers in Instagram Stories for São Paulo.

In September, I shared our commitment to keeping Instagram a positive place for self-expression. I’d like to tell you about a few more tools we’re launching to keep people safe. Comment Control Features Comments are where the majority of conversation happens on Instagram. While comments are largely positive, they’re not always kind or welcome. Previously, we launched the ability to filter comments based on keywords. This was an important step in giving you more control over your comments experience. However, there are two more features we think will improve this experience. We’ll soon add a way to turn off comments on any post. Sometimes there may be moments when you want to let your post stand on its own. Previously this was only available for a small number of accounts. In a few weeks, it will be available for everyone. Tap “Advanced Settings” before you post and then select “Turn Off Commenting.” You can also tap the … menu any time after posting to turn commenting back on. In the coming weeks, we’re also adding the ability to like comments by tapping a heart icon next to any comment. Liking lets you show support and encourages positivity throughout the community. Ability to Remove Followers from Private Accounts Some people on Instagram choose to have private accounts, which means they approve each follower. This is an important way for people to feel comfortable sharing with close friends and family. In the past, once you approved a follower, there was no simple way to undo that decision without blocking them. Going forward, if your account is private, you can remove followers by going to your list of followers and tapping the … menu next to any person’s name. The person will not be notified that you removed them as a follower. Anonymous Reporting for Self-Injury Posts Finally, we want to continue to be a place where people can share deeply personal moments. From time to time, you may see friends struggling and in need of support. If you believe that someone you care about may be thinking about injuring themselves, you can report it anonymously, and we will connect your friend to organizations that offer help. We have teams working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, around the world to review these reports. These updates still mark the beginning. We will continue to work to maintain Instagram as a welcoming and safe place for everyone. To learn more about these tools and others, check out the Instagram Help Center.

Since last month’s update, we’ve loved seeing how you’ve used Boomerang and mentions to make your stories even more fun. Now you have new ways to turn any moment into something you want to share with your friends and followers. Stickers No matter where you are or what you’re up to, you can add context to your story with stickers. After you’ve taken a photo or video, you’ll see a new stickers button next to the text and drawing tools. Tap the smiley face to find customizable stickers for weather, the current time and even your location. Adding a location sticker works the same as adding location to the posts you share to feed — simply choose or search for your location. People watching your story will be able to tap the sticker to learn more about the location, but your story won’t show up on the location page itself. It’s easy to make stickers your own: move them around, make them bigger or smaller and choose from different styles to match your mood. Subtle stickers let your photo or video shine, whereas vibrant stickers bring an extra pop of color to your story. And you can add as many stickers as you want to any part of your story. Holiday Fun You’ll see a set of holiday stickers available for the next few weeks. A special candy cane brush brings a sweet addition to your drawing tools, and keep an eye out for another set of stickers to ring in the new year! And More! A new ‘Hands-Free’ option in the format picker lets you start recording a video with just one tap. Whether you’re playing a guitar solo, building a snowman or perfecting your handstand, there’s no need to press and hold. You can add as much text to your photo or video as you’d like — simply keep tapping the text button to add more. Choose between left, center and right justified text, and a new slider lets you adjust size easily with automatic text wrap. Finally, on iOS, you can now save your entire story from the past 24 hours to your camera roll as a single video. To learn more about today’s updates, check out the Instagram Help Center. These updates for Instagram Stories are available as part of Instagram version 10.3 available for iOS in the Apple App Store and for Android in Google Play."},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-ways-to-share-with-instagram-stories-and-instagram-direct","date":"2016-11-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"New Ways to Share with Instagram Stories and Instagram Direct","text":"Today we’re announcing two updates: live video on Instagram Stories and disappearing photos and videos for groups and friends in Instagram Direct. In August, we introduced Instagram Stories as a way to share all the moments of your day, not just the ones you want to keep on your profile. We’ve seen stories open up a new side of what people share on Instagram, and now over 100 million people use it every day. With today’s announcement, you’ll soon have two more ways to share freely and in the moment. Announcing Live Video on Instagram Stories Live video on Instagram Stories helps you connect with your friends and followers right now. When you’re done, your live story disappears from the app so you can feel more comfortable sharing anything, anytime. It’s easy to go live — just swipe right from feed to open the camera, tap the “Start Live Video” button and start sharing for up to an hour. Your friends may get a notification when you go live so they can tune in. While you’re live, you can pin a comment for everyone to see or turn comments off altogether. When someone you follow starts a live story, you’ll see “Live” under their profile photo in the stories bar. During the broadcast, you can comment and like as much as you want. You can also check out new live stories on Explore. Tap “Top Live” to see exciting live stories happening at that moment and swipe right and left to easily skip around. Live video on Instagram Stories and Explore will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks. Launching Disappearing Photos and Videos for Groups and Friends in Instagram Direct Now you can send disappearing photos and videos directly to groups and individual friends in a spontaneous, pressure-free way. Since launching improvements to Instagram Direct last year, the number of people using Direct each month has grown from 80 million to 300 million people around the world. In fact, many of them use group threads every day to stay in touch with their closest friends and family. Today’s update keeps regular direct messages the same and adds a more visual way to connect with your closest friends — all in one convenient place. Swipe right into the camera to take a photo or video, then tap the arrow to send it privately. You can choose a group or create one in just a few taps — and you can also send to individual friends at the same time. Send anything you want, from inside jokes to your worst selfies. Unlike other messages in Direct, these photos and videos disappear from your friends’ inboxes after they have seen them. And you’ll see if they replayed it or took a screenshot. Whether your account is set to public or private, you can only send disappearing photos and videos to people who follow you. To open your inbox, tap the new paper airplane icon at the top right corner of your feed or swipe left. You’ll see disappearing photos and videos in a bar at the top. Tap the ones with blue rings to see what your friends sent you. In a group, you can see everyone’s responses — and who else has seen them — in a slideshow format. Then when you’re done, just tap their faded profile photo to send a quick response. Disappearing photos and videos in Instagram Direct will start rolling out globally today.

We’re also starting to test links inside some stories. Boomerang Boomerang lets you turn everyday moments into something fun and unexpected. Now you can easily take a Boomerang right inside Instagram. Swipe right from your feed to open the stories camera. A new format picker under the record button lets you select “Boomerang” mode. Tap record and the camera will stitch together a burst of photos into a mini video that plays forward and backward. Then share it to your story. Mentions Share who you’re with or who you’re thinking of by mentioning them in your story. Mentioning people in stories works the same as it does in captions and comments. When you add text to your story, type “@” followed by a username and select the person you’d like to mention. Their username will appear underlined in your story. And when someone taps the mention, they’ll see a pop-up that takes them to that profile. You’ll receive a notification in Direct when you’re mentioned in someone else’s story. Just tap the preview to go straight to the story for as long as it’s live. If someone you don’t follow mentions you, you’ll see the notification in your message requests. ‘See More’ Links Watching someone’s story and want to dig deeper? You may spot “See More” links at the bottom of some stories. This is a test that lets verified accounts add links so it’s easy to learn more. From discovering the latest music by Chance the Rapper (@chancetherapper) to learning about a new movie starring Dwayne Johnson (@therock) or reading a related article from Bustle (@bustle), tap “See More” or swipe up to view the link right inside the app. To learn more about today’s updates, check out the Instagram Help Center.

Images have the ability to inspire and bring out the best in us, whether they are funny, sad or beautiful. Over the past five years, I’ve watched in wonder as this community has grown to 500 million, with stories from every corner of the world. With this growth, we want to work diligently to maintain what has kept Instagram positive and safe, especially in the comments on your photos and videos. The beauty of the Instagram community is the diversity of its members. All different types of people — from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and more — call Instagram home, but sometimes the comments on their posts can be unkind. To empower each individual, we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment. It’s not only my personal wish to do this, I believe it’s also our responsibility as a company. So, today, we’re taking the next step to ensure Instagram remains a positive place to express yourself. The first feature we’re introducing is a keyword moderation tool that anyone can use. Now, when you tap the gear icon on your profile, you’ll find a new Comments tool. This feature lets you list words you consider offensive or inappropriate. Comments with these words will be hidden from your posts. You can choose your own list of words or use default words we’ve provided. This is in addition to the tools we’ve already developed such as swiping to delete comments, reporting inappropriate comments and blocking accounts. We know tools aren’t the only solution for this complex problem, but together, we can work towards keeping Instagram a safe place for self-expression. My commitment to you is that we will keep building features that safeguard the community and maintain what makes Instagram a positive and creative place for everyone.

Among the last 100 million to join, more than half live in Europe and Asia. The countries that added the most Instagrammers include Brazil, Japan and Indonesia. Instagrammers continue to capture incredible photos and videos from all corners of the earth (and even the solar system). We’ve seen inspiring moments like the first surface image of Pluto and Champions League celebrations, as well as striking locales like the white pools of Turkey and a Namibian desert ghost town. These are just a few of the more than 80 million photos per day shared on Instagram. Also, a few notable names have joined Instagram in the last 100 million. The most followed accounts include David Beckham from the UK, Caitlyn Jenner from the US, Indonesia’s Raffi and Nagita, German soccer player Toni Kroos and South Korea’s T.O.P.

Now more than 85 million people use Direct every month to send inside jokes, family videos, photos from road trips and other moments meant only for a handful of people. Today we’re announcing improvements to Instagram Direct including threaded messages and sending content from your feed as a Direct message. Threaded messages make it easier to go back and forth with the people you talk to the most. Instead of creating a new conversation every time you send a photo or video, your threads are based on the people in them — and your moments flow along naturally. We’ve also added the ability to name your groups, a quick camera feature to respond with a selfie on the fly, and larger-than-life emoji for when there are just no words. Today’s updates also bring a brand new way to start conversations around what you see on Instagram. When you find something inspiring or funny, your first instinct is often to share it with friends who you know will appreciate it. Today, people do this by @-mentioning friends in comments, so much so that nearly 40% of comments include an @-mention. This update has made it easier to share content that you love. Now, you’ll find an arrow next to the like and comment icons under every post. Tap it to send that post to a friend or group as a message using Instagram Direct. It will appear as part of your conversation, and you can tap the photo or video to see and like the original post. You can also send hashtag pages and location pages by tapping the arrow icon in the top right-hand corner. Privacy works the same way as it always has on Instagram. Photos and videos sent using Direct are only visible to people who could already see them. If the owner of a photo or video has their account set to private, only people who follow their account will be able to see it if it’s sent as a message in Direct. And, as always, you own your photos and videos — today’s updates do not change that. With these changes to Direct, it’s easier to connect around the things you love. We hope it helps bring the community closer together than ever. To learn more about today’s updates to Instagram Direct, check out the Instagram Help Center.

Square format has been and always will be part of who we are. That said, the visual story you’re trying to tell should always come first, and we want to make it simple and fun for you to share moments just the way you want to. It turns out that nearly one in five photos or videos people post aren’t in the square format, and we know that it hasn’t been easy to share this type of content on Instagram: friends get cut out of group shots, the subject of your video feels cramped and you can’t capture the Golden Gate Bridge from end to end. Now, when choosing a photo or video, you can tap the format icon to adjust the orientation to portrait or landscape instead of square. Once you share the photo, the full-sized version of it will appear to all of your followers in feed in a beautiful, natural way. To keep the clean feel of your profile grid, your post will appear there as a center-cropped square. We’re especially excited about what this update means for video on Instagram, which in widescreen can be more cinematic than ever. While we’ve historically had separate filters for photos and for videos, all filters will now work on all types of moments. You can also adjust the intensity of filters on videos, too. We continue to be inspired by the creativity and diversity of the Instagram community, and we can’t wait to see what you create next.

With more than 70 million photos and videos posted to Instagram every day, wherever something is happening, chances are you can see it here. Whether it’s behind the scenes at the NBA Finals, on the runway with the latest fashion trend at a favorite club with a local band, people are capturing moments large and small on Instagram. But, until now, there’s never been an easy way to find these moments. Reimagined Explore We’ve completely reimagined the Explore page to make discovery on Instagram immediate and effortless. The new Explore now surfaces trends as they emerge in real-time, connecting you to events and conversations both near you and around the globe. Through trending Tags and trending Places, you can experience moments like #bonnaroo or #fathersday from every perspective. Rich visual content captures everyone’s unique take — not just what the community is talking about, but also what they’re doing and seeing. In addition, at the top of the Explore page you will find new curated collections that will be updated regularly, featuring interesting accounts and places, from musicians and extreme athletes to stunning architecture and gorgeous beaches. To start, these updates to Explore will only be available in the United States. We’ll work to bring it to the rest of the world after we fine tune the experience and set it up to work well in other countries. Improved Search For everyone on Instagram, we’ve dramatically improved the ability to find what you’re looking for. With the new Places Search, you can now peer in at just about any location on earth, allowing you to scout out your next vacation spot in the South Pacific, get a look inside that hot new restaurant or experience your favorite music festival — even if you couldn’t make it this year. The new Top Search also lets you search across people, places and tags all at once. To learn more about the all-new Search and Explore, check out the Instagram Help Center.

Lark desaturates reds while punching up blues and greens to bring your landscapes to life. Reyes brings a dusty, vintage look to your moments. And finally, Juno tints cool tones green while making warm tones pop and whites glow for vibrant photos of people. Additionally, we’re bringing you a bonus update: you can also now use emoji in your hashtags. Over the past few years, emoji have become part of a universal visual language. And just as we share photos and videos, we use emoji to communicate emotions and feelings in ways that anyone can understand, regardless of language or background.

We’ve seen tremendous creativity within the community, not only in the moments they share, but in the time spent carefully composing and editing photos and videos to bring out emotions and make them beautiful. Inspired by the photography, art, fashion and design of the global Instagram community, we’re releasing five new filters that we believe are our best yet.

We’re thrilled to watch this community thrive and witness the amazing connections people make over shared passions and journeys. As Instagram gets bigger, we’re focused on helping you discover photos and videos from people who you care about, whether it’s a friend or your favorite musician. Last month, we launched a People tab on the Explore page, which highlights interesting accounts to follow, and we also launched improvements to search. Yet people ask, ‘When it comes to public figures and brands, how do I know that the people I discover on Instagram are really who they say they are? How do I know that this person really is Tony Hawk?’ Today, we’re excited to announce verified badges for celebrities, athletes and brands, making it easier for you to connect with the authentic accounts you’re looking for. These badges will start rolling out over the coming days. Finally, as more people join, keeping Instagram authentic is critical—it’s a place where real people share real moments. We’re committed to doing everything possible to keep Instagram free from the fake and spammy accounts that plague much of the web, and that’s why we’re finishing up some important work that began earlier this year. We’ve been deactivating spammy accounts from Instagram on an ongoing basis to improve your experience. As part of this effort, we will be deleting these accounts forever, so they will no longer be included in follower counts. This means that some of you will see a change in your follower count. Most of you won’t see any impact. If you’re one of those who will see a correction, you will receive a notification in the app directing you to additional information.

Hyperlapse from Instagram features built-in stabilization technology that lets you create moving, handheld time lapses that result in a cinematic look, quality and feel—a feat that has previously only been possible with expensive equipment. We designed Hyperlapse to be as simple as possible. You don’t need an account to create a hyperlapse. Instead, you open up straight to the camera. Tap once to begin recording and tap again to stop. Choose a playback speed that you like between 1x-12x and tap the green check mark to save it to your camera roll. You can share your video on Instagram easily from there.

Over the past three years, the Instagram community has grown to over 150 million people capturing and sharing moments all around the globe. As we’ve grown, Instagram has evolved not only into a community of photographers, but also into a means of visual communication. From a photo of your daily coffee to a sunrise shared from the top of a mountain hike, every Instagram moment contains something you find special—something you broadcast to your followers when you tap “share.” There are, however, moments in our lives that we want to share, but that will be the most relevant only to a smaller group of people—an inside joke between friends captured on the go, a special family moment or even just one more photo of your new puppy. Instagram Direct helps you share these moments. From how you capture photos and videos to the way you start conversations through likes and comments, we built Instagram Direct to feel natural to the Instagram experience you already know. When you open Instagram, you’ll now see a new icon in the top right corner of your home feed. Tap it to open your inbox where you’ll see photos and videos that people have sent to you. To send a photo or video to specific people, tap the camera button to enter the same simple photo or video capture and editing screens. At the top of the share screen, you’ll see the option to share with your followers (“Followers”) or to send to specific people (“Direct”). To send using Direct, tap the names of the people you want to send your photo or video to, write your caption, tap “send” and you’re done. After sending, you’ll be able to find out who’s seen your photo or video, see who’s liked it and watch your recipients commenting in real time as the conversation unfolds. Photos and videos that you receive from people you follow will appear immediately.

You see, having so little insulation in the office had an unintended consequence of being able to hear the crowd roar every time someone hit a long ball out towards McCovey Cove. Back in the office, we’d lift our heads up from code with every eruption of the fans, wondering who was at bat, what had happened, and whether the ball had made it or not. We never knew, but that wasn’t the point.While we may only have had a few thousand people around the world using Instagram that night, we had a sense that maybe through Instagram we could tune in to what was happening just a few steps away. With a few quick commands at his terminal, my co-founder Mike’s screen filled with images of the game: the bullpen, dugout, concession stands, cheering fans and a panoramic view from somewhere up high. In a matter of hours, the people in that stadium had recorded moments in time through Instagram and allowed us to tune into an event while we sat a half a mile away, working—winter coats and all.For the first time, we understood why Instagram was going to be different. We understood the power of images to connect people to what was happening in the world around them. And, although Instagram had a fraction of the user base it does today, that night we saw a preview of what Instagram would enable at a much larger scale down the road.Now, nearly two and a half years later, over 100 million people use Instagram every month. It’s easy to see this as an accomplishment for a company, but I think the truth is that it’s an accomplishment for our community. Now, more than ever, people are capturing the world in real-time using Instagram—sharing images from the farthest corners of the globe. What we see as a result is a world more connected and understood through photographs.Of the 100 million people on Instagram, there are stories that awe us: stories like Kathryn Mahoney’s (@nineteenfiftyone). Kathryn is an aid worker for the United Nations in the most remote refugee camp in Southern Sudan. She shares vivid photos of the day-to-day life of the people who live in Yida as well as the struggles and triumphs of the UN’s work there. From thousands of miles away, Kathryn reminds us of the power of images to educate and inspire.There are love stories that move us, like the story of Cory (@withhearts) and Bethany (@bethanyolson) who began following each other a year and a half ago at the suggestion of a mutual photographer friend. After trading likes on photos, meeting for coffee, and finally joining up for a photowalk, a mutual interest in photography turned into dating. To this day, they still go on photography adventures and explore the world together with Instagram in tow.And there are inspiring stories of small businesses and artisans. Mission Bicycle (@missionbicycle), a small, independent manufacturer in San Francisco, has amassed nearly 50,000 followers as they share the photos from their daily work of making beautiful bicycles by hand. Similarly, Sightglass Coffee (@sightglass) shares photos from their harvesting grounds in El Salvador and Ethiopia to remind us that even a local business has global connections.Images have the ability to connect people from all backgrounds, languages and cultures. They connect us to aid workers halfway across the world in Sudan, to entrepreneurs in San Francisco and even to events in our own backyards. Instagram, as a tool to inspire and connect, is only as powerful as the community it is made of. For this reason, we feel extremely lucky to have the chance to build this with all of you. So from our team to the hundred million people who call Instagram home, we say thank you. Thank you for sharing your world and inspiring us all to do the same.Kevin SystromCo-Founder, Instagram"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-your-instagram-feed-on-desktop","date":"2013-02-04T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Introducing Your Instagram Feed on Desktop","text":"Today, I’m very excited to announce the launch of a product we’ve been wanting to build for quite some time now. Since our launch in October of 2010, we’ve focused on building a simple app that has inspired creativity while capturing everyday moments through the lens of your mobile phone. In fact, our focus on building out a mobile-only experience is a unique path that we’ve chosen for many reasons, the most important of which is that Instagram, at its core, is about seeing and taking photos on-the-go. However, to make Instagram even more accessible to our growing community, at the end of last year we started to expand to the desktop web, giving you the ability to see profiles from instagram.com. To continue that path, as of today, you can now browse your Instagram feed on the web – just like you do on your mobile device. Go to instagram.com and log in to your account to give it a try. Your Instagram Feed on the web functions much like it does on your mobile phone. You can browse through the latest photos of people whom you follow with updates as people post new photos. Like photos by double clicking on them or pressing the like button. Or, engage in a conversation around a photo with inline commenting. Browse through pages of the most recent images to keep up on what’s happening with the people you follow in realtime. And shrink your browser down to a single column for your feed to look more like your mobile feed. Simply put, we’ve brought a simple, powerful, and beautiful Instagram browsing experience to the web.We believe that you should be able to access Instagram on a variety of different devices, any of which may be convenient to you at a given moment – including your desktop computer or tablet. We do not offer the ability to upload from the web as Instagram is about producing photos on the go, in the real world, in realtime. On the other hand, Instagram for the web is focused on making the browsing experience a fast, simple and enjoyable one.This product was made possible by a small, talented group of engineers and designers on the Instagram team whose goal it was to make Instagram for the web be the most simple, straightforward, and beautiful web experience for the Instagram community. We look forward to hearing your feedback, and thank you as always for your support as we build this product and community together.Kevin SystromCo-Founder, Instagram"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-translations-for-25-languages","date":"2012-12-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Announcements"],"title":"Instagram Translations for 25 Languages","text":"We’ve got some exciting new things in store with this update: new and improved language translations, a new filter, and updates to address the feedback we’ve heard from you! Translations for 25 Languages Today, we’re introducing new and improved translations for 25 languages on Instagram! You can now navigate Instagram in your native language–on both mobile devices and the web–making it easier for anyone around the world to sign up for an account. Enjoying photos on Instagram may not require written language, but translating Instagram helps all users understand how to use the product by explaining concepts like: following, liking, hashtags, photo maps & locations. We use very few words in our product, but when we do they’re very important words to understand. By introducing 25 new and improved languages, we can welcome even more international users into the Instagram community!

This filter has a warm pink tone, subtle vignetting that brightens the center of the photograph, and a thin black border. Mayfair works great with evenly and well-lit scenes in conjunction with the Lux feature. Instagram will now recognize if you’ve enabled Facebook integration with iOS 6, allowing people to easily sign up for an account or quickly connect an existing Instagram account with Facebook. This means you’ll no longer be brought to the Facebook app or a web-view to connect your account. Read more about this new feature in our Help Center. We’ve also included the following updates based on your feedback: The ability to select photographs from an album other than the Camera Roll. Photos taken utilizing the front-facing camera will no longer be mirrored. Fixed a bug that affected photo sharing for certain locales present in version 3.4. Various bug fixes and improvements surrounding camera performance. iOS Version 3.4 In addition to 25 new and improved translations and the new Mayfair filter, the latest version of Instagram for Android allows Facebook Page moderators to connect and share directly to a brand page. Note: iOS version 3.4.1 fixes a bug found in version 3.4 that displayed an inaccurate privacy toggle switch. It also fixes a bug that affected photo sharing for certain locales.

In the days since, it became clear that we failed to fulfill what I consider one of our most important responsibilities – to communicate our intentions clearly. I am sorry for that, and I am focused on making it right. The concerns we heard about from you the most focused on advertising, and what our changes might mean for you and your photos. There was confusion and real concern about what our possible advertising products could look like and how they would work. Because of the feedback we have heard from you, we are reverting this advertising section to the original version that has been in effect since we launched the service in October 2010. You can see the updated terms here. Going forward, rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed, we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work. You also had deep concerns about whether under our new terms, Instagram had any plans to sell your content. I want to be really clear: Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did. We don’t own your photos – you do. Finally, there was also confusion about how widely shared and distributed your photos are through our service. The distribution of your content and photos is governed by our privacy policy, and always has been. We have made a small change to our terms to make that as clear as possible. You can view the current terms and privacy policy, as well as review the updated terms and privacy policy that will take effect on January 19, 2013. I’m proud that Instagram has a community that feels so strongly about a product we all love. I’m even more proud that you feel empowered to be vocal and approach us with constructive feedback to help us build a better product. Thank you for your feedback, and I look forward to all that Instagram has to bring in the New Year.

Willow is a monochrome filter with subtle purple tones and a translucent glowing white border. This filter works well on portraits, still life and architecture photographs with contrast. Improved Tilt Shift In the past, there had been vast differences in the effective strength of the blur between the preview screen and the output in your feed and camera roll. With this update the blur you see is now the blur you’ll get! We’ve also completely overhauled the blur algorithm to increase quality and accuracy. Tilt-shift now gives a vastly more realistic rendering of depth of field because of these improvements and subtle tweaks to how we render the image.

We’re excited to announce that today Instagram 3.0 is available to everyone. Download Instagram 3.0 for Apple here or for Android here. With every major release, we pick a theme – and for this one we’ve focused on the browsing experience. We’ve introduced a new and unique way to browse your photos and others’ photos on a map, which means you’re no longer constrained to browsing through page after page of photos. We’ve also worked hard on updating all the screens in our app to be more visually consistent and polished. You’ll notice new layouts throughout the app that feel fresh, yet familiar. Our engineers have also been hard at work making sure that the browsing experience is as fast as possible. On newer devices, you should notice a marked improvement in speed while browsing. With that, we’ve introduced infinite scrolling in feeds so that you can quickly see more photos while browsing around the app. And finally, we’ve paid special attention to keeping Instagram a safe place. With improved reporting tools, users can now flag both photos and comments for review with ease. We’re very excited by how much has gone into this release – as always, please provide us with feedback as you explore the new features. Photo Maps Introducing Photo Maps, a new way to browse photos on Instagram. Your Photo Map appears on your profile and lets you showcase your photos on a map. Also, you’ll be able to see other users’ maps from their profiles as well.Important: Before your map is visible to the public, you’ll be prompted to review any photos you previously geotagged. Additionally, we’ve made it easy to remove photos from your map at any time, which will remove any associated geo-data but leave the photos intact on your profile. To read more about how Photo Maps work, read more here. New look for user profiles, the Explore tab, hashtag & location pages Also, we now display bigger grid photos to make it easier to browse large collections of photos and see them too. You’ll find bigger grid photos on user profiles, the Explore tab, as well as on hashtag and location pages. New look for the photo upload screen Larger text box for captions: It’s now easier to write and edit longer captions for your photos. Geotag your photos by selecting “Add to Your Photo Map”: Let people know where you took your photo by turning “Add to Your Photo Map” on. By enabling this feature on your photo, you will store your current location with the photo and it will show up on your map. You’ll also have the ability to choose a specific place name (e.g. “South Park Cafe”) to associate with your photo. Learn more in our help center.Infinite scrolling (automatic “load more”) Now, when you get to the bottom of a page, we’ll automatically load more photos for you – no need to tap a “load more” button. Many speed improvements to make the app faster & more responsiveInstagram v3.0 contains many speed and loading optimizations on newer devices.Users can now report individual comments as abuse or spam To ensure Instagram is a safe and fun place to share your photos, we’ve introduced a way to report comments. Now, just swipe right or tap on a comment and tap the trashcan icon. You can then select “Delete & Report Abuse” to remove the comment and report it in a single action. If you see an abusive or spammy comment on someone else’s photo, you can now easily report it as spam by following the steps above, though you will see a different icon instead of the trash icon. Note: Reporting comments that are not on your own photos is not included in the current Android version, but we do plan to add it in a future release. Flagging a user has been simplified to one choice: “Report for Spam.” To report a user, tap the button at the top right corner of their profile page, then “Report for Spam.” If you’d like to report a user for other reasons, please report the abusive or spammy comments or images. To report a photo, just tap the “…” button below the photo and then “Report Inappropriate.”"},{"platform":"Instagram","url":"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-reaches-80-million-users","date":"2012-07-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Instagram","Announcements"],"title":"Instagram Reaches 80 Million Users","text":"@tennisguy @ambozeman @ishootiphone We’re excited to announce that the Instagram community has grown to over 80 million registered users who have shared nearly 4 billion photos!

Creators can use broadcast channels to help followers stay in-the-know with the latest updates and behind-the-scenes moments using text, photo, video, voice notes and polls. Followers can react to content and participate in polls, with more features coming soon. Starting today, we're testing the new chat feature with a handful of US creators and will begin rolling out to more creators soon. Introducing Broadcast Channels We're always exploring new ways to help creators directly reach their audience and form deeper connections with their communities. Today, Mark Zuckerberg announced broadcast channels on Instagram with his own “Meta Channel 📢”. Broadcast channels are a public, one-to-many messaging tool for creators to invite all of their followers into and engage with their most interested fans. Creators can use broadcast channels as a casual, quick way to keep followers up-to-date. They can use text, photo, video and voice notes to share their latest updates and behind-the-scenes moments and even create polls to crowdsource fan feedback. Only creators can send messages, while followers can react to content and vote in polls. In the coming months, Instagram will be adding more features, such as the ability to bring another creator into the channel to discuss upcoming collabs, collect questions for an AMA via question prompts, and more - the possibilities for connecting with fans are endless, and we can't wait to see how creators begin using their channels. Check Out Who's Using Channels Check out the following creators who are starting their broadcast channels today. Head to their profiles and tap the channel link in bio (accessible via mobile only): Austin Sprinz, Content Creator: Follow @austin_sprinz Chloe Kim, Two-time Olympic gold medalist snowboarder: Follow @chloekim David Allen, Content Creator: Follow @ToTouchanEmu FaZe Rug, Content Creator: Follow @fazerug Flau'jae, Basketball and rap star: Follow @flaujae Gilbert Burns, Mixed Martial Artist: Follow @gilbert_burns Josh Richards, Media Personality and Entrepreneur: Follow @joshrichards Karen Cheng, Creative Director: Follow @karenxcheng Katie Feeney, Content Creator: Follow @katiefeeneyy Lonnie IIV, Digital Creator: Follow @LonnieIIV Mackenzie Dern, Jiu-Jitsu black belt UFC fighter: Follow @mackenziedern Mikaela Shiffrin, Winningest Woman Alpine Skier of All Time: Follow @mikaelashiffrin Tank Sinatra, Meme Sensation: Follow @tank.sinatra Valkyrae, Creator & Streamer: Follow @valkyrae How Does It Work? Once a creator gets access, they can start a broadcast channel from their Instagram inbox. Upon sending their first broadcast channel message, their followers will receive a one-time notification to join the channel. As soon as the broadcast channel is live, creators can also encourage followers to join by using the “join channel” sticker in Stories or by pinning the channel link to their profile. For creators with Subscriptions who want to create a broadcast channel open to all followers, be sure to set the audience to “all followers.” There's also the option to create a broadcast channel limited to paid subscribers for your most exclusive content. Here's how to join a broadcast channel: Access the link to the broadcast channel on a mobile device via a creator's Story sticker, the link pinned to their profile or, as an existing follower, a one-time notification sent when a creator starts a new channel. Tap “Join broadcast channel.” People not yet following the creator will be prompted to do so. After joining the channel, it will appear in the Instagram inbox next to other message threads. Followers can react to content and vote in polls, but cannot send messages. They can also share a link to their favorite creators' broadcast channels so friends can follow and join. Anyone can discover the broadcast channel and view the content. All followers will receive the first notification inviting them to join the broadcast channel; however, only followers who have joined will receive subsequent notifications for new updates. Followers can leave or mute broadcast channels at any time, or turn off a creator's broadcast channel notifications entirely. Getting Early Access We're currently testing broadcast channels with a handful of U.S. creators and plan to expand in the coming months. Creators who are interested can sign up to be considered for early access HERE: (please access the waitlist on your mobile device). Spots are limited and we will be providing early access on a rolling basis. Coming Soon to Messenger and Facebook While we are first introducing this new feature to Instagram, we'll also be testing broadcast channels in Messenger and Facebook in the coming months. We'll have more to share as broadcast channels become more widely available. Privacy & Safety To help people feel safe and welcome, broadcast channels are subject to Instagram's Community Guidelines. People can report both the broadcast channel itself or specific content shared in the channel, which can be removed if it goes against Meta policies. Broadcast channels are designed for public and discoverable chat experiences, so they are treated differently from private messaging on Instagram. We have tools and reviewers to help us identify, review or remove content in broadcast channels that may violate our Community Guidelines – often before anyone sees it. To learn more about the differences between channels and private conversations on Instagram, check out our Help Center.

We’re giving people more ways to tell us what types of content they want to avoid in places like Explore, Search and Reels. We're also making updates to our supervision tools to make it easier for parents to talk to their teens about their Instagram settings. Helping You Focus and Set Boundaries With Quiet Mode Today, we’re launching ‘Quiet mode’ to help people focus, and to encourage people to set boundaries with friends and followers. Once enabled, you won’t receive any notifications, your profile’s activity status will change to ‘In quiet mode’ and we’ll automatically send an auto-reply when someone DMs you. Teens have told us that they sometimes want to take time for themselves and might be looking for more ways to focus at night, while studying, and during school. You can easily customize your ‘Quiet mode’ hours to fit your schedule and once the feature is turned off, we’ll show you a quick summary of notifications so you can catch up on what you missed. Anyone can use ‘Quiet mode’, but we’ll prompt teens to do so when they spend a specific amount of time on Instagram late at night. ‘Quiet mode’ will be available to everyone in the US, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand today, and we hope to bring it to more countries soon. New Ways to Manage Your Recommendations We want to give people more control over the content they see on Instagram, so we're introducing new features that allow people to tell us what content they don’t want recommended to them. First, you can now choose to hide multiple pieces of content in Explore that you aren’t interested in at one time. Additionally, when you select “Not interested” on a post seen in Explore, we’ll aim to avoid showing you this kind of content going forward in other places where we make recommendations, like Reels, Search and more. Next, while you can already hide comments and DMs containing specific words, we're now expanding this feature to apply to recommended posts you might see across Instagram. Add a word or list of words, emojis or hashtags that you want to avoid – like “fitness” or “recipes” – and we’ll work to no longer recommend content with those words in the caption or the hashtag. You can access this in the Hidden Words section of Privacy settings. Support Teens’ Experiences with Updated Parental Supervision Tools In addition to providing teens with more ways to manage their time and experiences on Instagram, we want to help parents be more aware of the choices their teens make, and make it easier for them to have discussions with their teens about their settings through Family Center and supervision tools. Recently, we added the ability for parents to see their teen’s Instagram settings, including privacy and account settings. If their teen updates a setting, parents will receive a notification so they can talk to their teen about the change. Parents can now also view accounts their teen has blocked. For conversation starters and to learn more about the available parental supervision tools, including how to set time limits, schedule breaks, be notified when teens share a report and more, visit Family Center. These updates are part of our ongoing work to ensure people have experiences that work for them, and that they have more control over the time they spend online and the types of content they see.

There are some easy things you can do to help keep your account safe, like making sure you have a strong password and enabling two-factor authentication. You can also review and increase security for your account at any time by completing Instagram’s Security Check-Up. In addition to these ongoing safety tools, we’re excited to highlight several new features designed to help keep people’s accounts safe, and offer them more support if they lose account access.Additional Account SupportTo support accounts that are experiencing access issues or may have been hacked, we created Instagram.com/hacked - a new, comprehensive destination people can rely on to report and resolve account access issues. If you’re unable to log in to your account, enter Instagram.com/hacked on your mobile phone or desktop browser. Next, you will be able to select if you think you’ve been hacked, forgot your password, lost access to two-factor authentication or if your account has been disabled. From there, you will be able to follow a series of steps to help regain access to your account. If you have multiple accounts associated with your information, you will be able to choose which account needs support.We know losing access to your Instagram account can be stressful, so we want to ensure people have multiple options to get their accounts back if they lose access. Earlier this year we started testing a way for people to ask their friends to confirm their identity in order to help regain access to their account, and this option is now available to everyone on Instagram. If you find yourself locked out of your account, you will be able to choose two of your Instagram friends to verify your identity and get back into your account. Keeping Your Account SecureIn addition to new account support and recovery methods, we’re testing ways to help prevent hacking on Instagram before it happens. First, we remove accounts that our automated systems find to be malicious, including ones that impersonate others, which goes against our Community Guidelines. Second, because bad actors often don’t immediately use accounts maliciously, we’re now testing sending warnings if an account that we suspect may be impersonating someone requests to follow you. In the coming months, we’ll also send warnings if an account that may be impersonating a business sends you a Direct Message (DM). Finally, we’re now showing the blue verified badge for verified accounts in more places across Instagram. That way, you can quickly determine whether the account you are interacting with is authentic. In addition to Profiles, you can now see verified blue badges in Stories and DMs and coming soon, Feed.

Today, we’re introducing several updates to help you feel closer to the people you care about. Share your thoughtsWe’re beginning to roll out Notes, a new way to share your thoughts and see what your friends are up to. Notes are short posts of up to 60 characters using just text and emojis. To leave a note, go to the top of your inbox, select the followers you follow back or people on your Close Friends list, and your note will appear at the top of their inbox for 24 hours. Replies to notes will arrive as DMs in your inbox.During testing, we learned that people liked having a lightweight, easy way to share what’s on their mind and start conversations. From asking for recommendations to sharing what they’re up to, Notes give people a casual and spontaneous way to express themselves and connect with each other. Create moments with friendsPeople enjoy sharing throughout their day to Stories – from highlights to the more everyday moments. We’re testing new features in Stories to help people more easily share in spontaneous, fun ways to help create even stronger connections with friends.Add Yours nominations: Since we launched Add Yours in Stories last year, we’ve seen how prompts help inspire people to share in unplanned and creative ways. We’re testing an update to Add Yours where you can invite friends to participate by tapping “pass it on” when you see a prompt that reminds you of them.Candid Stories: We’re starting to test Candid, a new way for you and your friends to capture and share what you’re doing right now in a story that’s only visible to those who also share their own. Capture a candid from the stories camera, the multi-author story at the top of feed, or from the daily notification reminder that starts after your first candid. For those who don’t want to receive the daily notification reminder, you can always turn it off in your Settings. We’re also testing a similar feature on Facebook Stories.Collaborate and keep up with groupsGroup Profiles: Soon, people will be able to create and join this new type of profile to share posts and stories in a dedicated, shared profile with friends. Whenever you share content to a Group Profile, that content will only be shared to group members instead of your followers, and will be posted on the Group Profile instead of your own. To create a new group profile, tap the “+” and select Group Profiles. Collaborative Collections: We’re testing a way for people to connect with friends over their shared interests by saving posts to a collaborative collection in your group or 1:1 DMs. You can start or add to a collaborative collection by saving a post directly from feed or sharing a post to a friend via DM and saving it from there.Connecting with friends is a core part of the Instagram experience, and we’ll continue to test and build features that help you feel closer with them.

The exhibit, “Embracing Our Sovereignty,” offers a glimpse into the lives of Amaya’s Indigenous family, friends and collaborators. For Amaya — a writer, director and multidisciplinary artist who is A:shiwi, Rarámuri and Yoeme — AR is a new space. In collaboration with Hayato Kuno, a visual and technical artist in Japan, Amaya used Meta Spark to add layers of meaning and storytelling to three of his images. In all of his work, Amaya aims to produce what he calls visual medicine. “Every frame that I create is like a word in a poem,” he says. The feeling he hopes people take away from his body of work: “The feeling of being loved, and that we all deserve to be loved.” “Embracing Our Sovereignty” opens Dec. 1, 2022, between 6pm - 8pm, at 145 Plymouth Street in Brooklyn, NY. Learn more about the show, which is presented in partnership with the Brooklyn non-profit Photoville with support from Two Trees Management. This exhibition will be on view until December 16 and is free and open to the public. AR is one of the fastest-growing tech industry sectors used broadly across communication, shopping, entertainment, creative expression and more. It’s expected to become a $98 billion market by 2028, and as it grows, Meta is committed to empowering artists and creators by introducing new ways to express themselves with AR technologies like Meta Spark. Today, mobile AR offers an immersive, interactive way for people to connect with friends, express their perspectives and explore storytelling in a more personal way. For artists and creators, AR effects also offer an engaging way to extend their craft and bring their community closer together.

With this update, you can: Check if your account’s content can be recommended: See if your content may be eligible to be recommended to non-followers in places like Explore, Reels and Feed Recommendations. Understand issues: If your account’s content is not eligible to be recommended, you can see a sample of content or components of your profile that may go against our Recommendations Guidelines and any content that has been removed for violating our Community Guidelines. Fix problems: Edit or delete posts that may go against our Recommendations Guidelines. You can also request for our review team to take another look if you think we made a mistake. We know that, for many creators, having Instagram recommend your content is a great way to reach new fans and grow your audience. That’s why it’s important to us that creators understand our guidelines and are able to know if something they’ve posted or have in their profile may be impacting their reach to non-followers. It’s also why we’re introducing the ability to disagree with our decision so our review team can take another look as quickly as possible and we can continue to improve our detection technology. With these updates, we want to help you understand issues with your account and better explain how our systems and rules work. We’re continuing to improve Account Status to cover more areas (like Search and Suggested Accounts), and add more ways for you to understand and fix issues that may affect how you reach non-followers. You can visit Account Status by tapping into Settings, tapping Account, and then tapping Account Status. Original post, October 11, 2021: We're committed to sharing more information about the nuts and bolts of Instagram, and we recently published posts on how our algorithms work and how Search works. Today we’re announcing two new features to help give people more information about Instagram outages and their account status, directly in the app.Telling you when something goes wrong on InstagramThrough conversations with our community and extensive research, we know how confusing it can be when temporary issues happen on Instagram. When they impact engagement or distribution, we also know that it can lead people to think that the problems are unique to them, based on what they post. That lack of clarity can be frustrating, which is why we want it to be easier to understand what's going on, directly from us.We’re testing a new feature that will notify you in your Activity Feed when we experience an outage or technical issue, and when it is resolved. We won’t send a notification every single time there is an outage, but when we see that people are confused and looking for answers, we’ll determine if something like this could help make things clearer. This test will run in the US and go on for the next few months. Just like any experiment, this may be something we roll out more widely, but we want to start small and learn. And if it makes sense to, we’ll expand to more people.Account StatusLast year we introduced Support Requests to give people more information about anything they previously reported on Instagram – posts, comments, profiles – and to let people know if anything they posted went against our Community Guidelines.We're making changes to make it even easier to know what's going on with your account, in a new tool called \"Account Status\". Account Status will be your one-stop shop to see what’s happening with your account and content distribution.We’ll start by making it easier for people to know whether their account is at risk of being disabled. In the coming months, we plan to add more information to this tool, giving people a better sense of how their content is being distributed and recommended across different parts of Instagram.If you think we’ve made a mistake, you’ll also be able to appeal by hitting “Request a Review” directly from your Account Status.We’ll be sharing more about both these features over time, so make sure to look out for updates.

Since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency in January, we’ve taken steps to help people access accurate information, stay safe, and stay connected. Today we're announcing additional updates: Including more educational resources in Instagram Search Adding stickers to promote accurate information Removing COVID-19 accounts from recommendations, unless posted by a credible health organization Rolling out the donation sticker in more countries and helping people find relevant nonprofits to support Creating a shared story to help those practicing social distancing connect with others, using a “Stay Home” sticker Launching a new way to browse Instagram with friends over video chat Accessing Accurate InformationPeople who search for information related to the coronavirus or COVID-19 on Instagram will start to see an educational message connecting them to resources from the World Health Organization and local health ministries. We are working quickly to make this available globally over the coming weeks.We’re also launching new stickers to help people share accurate COVID-19 information in Stories. These new features include reminders to wash your hands, distance yourself from others and more. These will be available in the camera in the coming days.Over the past few weeks we've added a notice at the top of feed for countries affected by COVID-19. The notice includes reliable resources from expert health organizations. In addition, we’ve been highlighting resources from these organizations when people view related hashtags.Keeping Our Community SafeIn addition to promoting credible information throughout our app, we’re making several changes to reduce the spread of misinformation.We’ll remove COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, and we are working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore, unless posted by a credible health organization. We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third-party-fact checkers.This is in addition to our existing policies on misinformation. If posts are rated false by third-party-fact checkers, we remove them from Explore and hashtag pages. We also remove false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities as having the potential to cause harm to people who believe them.To prevent people from exploiting this public health emergency we’ve already put several new policies into effect. We prohibited misleading ads for products that refer to COVID-19 in ways intended to create urgency, guarantee cures or prevent people from contracting it, and we have temporarily banned advertisements and branded content that promote certain medical supplies, including face masks. In addition, we removed the ability to search for COVID-19 related AR effects unless they were developed in partnership with a recognized health organization.Staying Connected and Supporting CommunitiesTo help people support relief efforts, we’re making our Donation sticker available in additional countries and adding a new COVID-19 section so people can quickly identify relevant nonprofits.To help people stay connected, we’ve launched media sharing, a new feature that allows you to view Instagram posts together with your friends over video chat. You can start a video chat by tapping the video chat icon in the Direct inbox or in an existing Direct thread, then view saved, liked and suggested photos/videos by tapping the photo icon in the bottom left corner in an ongoing video chat.Finally, we’ve launched a “Stay Home” sticker. Any accounts you follow who use the sticker will be added to a shared Instagram story, allowing you to see how others are practicing social distancing at this time.We will continue to prioritize safety, connecting people with accurate information, and encouraging support as the COVID-19 outbreak evolves. We’re closely monitoring the situation and regularly sharing updates at about.fb.com/coronavirus. For latest news and information on how to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, please visit the World Health Organization."}]
