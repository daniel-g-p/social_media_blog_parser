Look no further than Reddit, a digital crystal ball full of the communities and conversations that are shaping the future. It may be hard to believe it but our r/bitcoin community was established in 2010, and to put that into context, that’s the same year the first iPad was released. What’s more, r/electricvehicles started in 2009 and r/smarthome in 2013, many years before either of the technologies became mainstream, so there’s no denying that Reddit users have long pointed us to what’s coming next. Understanding how consumers are thinking about the products and services of tomorrow is key to unlocking marketing success today, and that’s exactly what we’ll be unveiling at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) next year as part of our very first activation at the event.",

Gen Z creates, edits, posts, comments, likes and follows in ways that may feel completely unfamiliar to older generations. To better understand how younger audiences behave on social media, we worked with YPulse to gather research and create a comprehensive whitepaper on Gen Z and Millenial social media patterns.",

    "description": "Reddit’s Advertising business has seen incredible growth over the last few years and has consistently evolved to meet the needs of our increasing advertiser base. Providing transparency to advertisers on how users engage with their ads is a critical feature for any advertising platform. To derive the information that advertisers care about, we need to empower them to perform specific aggregates and breakdowns across large amounts of data. Our ads generate tens of gigabytes of event data per hour. Allowing advertisers to query across the last six months of data means that we have hundreds of billions of raw events to sift through. We also need to scale well beyond this since we expect our event volume to significantly increase over the next year.",

Those don’t even really matter.” He went ahead with the deploy, hastily jamming them into an already overloaded function, eager to get the change out before the 4-day weekend. Although the work week was short, it had felt long and his bleary eyes needed rest. What he did not know, and could not know, was that a storm was brewing on the horizon…",

    "description": "What if I told you that you could exponentially advance the trajectory of your career by applying one specific principle to how you approach projects at work? It sounds far fetched, but for me, it worked. The principle is called The Matthew Effect, which states “Those who already have status are often placed in situations where they gain more, and those that do not have status typically struggle to achieve more.” I stumbled across this principle two years ago, completely by accident, after picking up a side project to reduce the massive clutter we were seeing in our error logging. My project reduced our error logging by ~96% (removing a total of 149 million log lines per day) and suddenly, people were paying attention to my work. As the principle states, once you are recognized, all of your future work is more likely to get recognized. I started getting invited to new, important meetings. My opinion suddenly seemed to matter more. I was placed in the ‘Top Performers’ tier and won an internal award from our CTO. I became tech lead for a new team and was ultimately promoted to a manager position, all within a year of completing this project. And maybe the most important metric of them all, my salary since my project launched has increased by 40%. I am confident that without (accidentally) creating my own Matthew Effect, it would have taken much longer for my career to reach this point.",

In fact, research has shown that push notifications can result in people visiting an app 88% more frequently and users that opt in to push notifications come back to the app at nearly twice the rate of those who don’t. Additionally, research has indicated that about 50% of mobile app users find push notifications helpful, so we also had a chance to help even hardcore users use Reddit more easily. Push notifications, if used correctly, can have multiple benefits for users: they help notify users of relevant content, allow users to benefit from Reddit without needing to open the app, and enable users to discover new ways in which to engage with their communities..",
