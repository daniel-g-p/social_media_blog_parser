For those who were able to join in person or tune in, it was a pleasure to share our vision with you. You can find the full transcript and slides on our Investor Relations website here. Below you can find some key stats and a summary of each executive speaker’s presentation.Our community has now grown to over 750 million monthly active users.At our current growth rate, we see a path for Snapchat to reach over 1 billion people in the next two to three years.In North America, we have grown to over 150 million monthly active users.Snapchatters in the US open the app nearly 40 times per day.Over 60% of Snapchatters who open Snapchat each day create Snaps.Over 70% of Snapchatters who download Snapchat engage with AR on their first day in the app.Time spent per Spotlight viewer now meaningfully exceeds the time spent watching Friend Stories per Story viewer.In just over six months after launching, Snapchat+ has reached over 2.5 million subscribers and an annual revenue run rate of over $100 million.___Evan Spiegel, co-founder and CEO, began the day by discussing Snap’s vision, progress, and plans as a business, as well as our long-term opportunity and potential for the company:“We’re very grateful that you’re here, and we’re excited to share more about our vision for Snap. Our long-term opportunity is enormous, but we’re tackling a few significant challenges at the moment — the volatile macroeconomic environment, platform policy changes, and increasing competition.”“Our goal today is to give you confidence in our ability to address those challenges by providing our plans and our progress to date. We are also looking forward to sharing why we are so excited about the longer-term potential for our business.”“While Snap is still a small business compared to many large technology companies, we’ve made a lot of progress, growing revenues to $4.6 billion in 2022. Our large, hard-to-reach audience, brand-safe environment, and innovative advertising platform have made us a valuable partner for businesses that want to reach the next generation.” “Today, we’re pleased to share that our community has now grown to over 750 million monthly active users. We reach more than 75% of 13- to 34 year-olds in over 20 countries, with these countries representing over 50% of the advertising market. Over 100 million daily active users have joined Snapchat since our last Investor Day, with our community now totaling more than 375 million daily active users.”“On average, over 5 billion Snaps are created every day, the best of which our community submits to Spotlight. We are pleased with the rapid growth we’re seeing in time spent per Spotlight viewer, which now meaningfully exceeds the time spent watching Friend Stories per Story viewer.”“When Bobby and I first started building Snapchat, we wanted to make communication better. We started by making it visual and ephemeral, using disappearing images to bring life into digital conversations. Since then, we’ve grown our business by identifying everyday human behaviors and working to make them better through design, innovation, and technology.”“We have everything we need to build a successful business over the long term. A large and growing community, an innovative and engaging product that continues to evolve, a strong balance sheet with a track record of positive free cash flow, and a long-term vision for what we believe will be the most meaningful advancement in computing the world has ever seen: augmented reality.”Jacob Andreou, SVP of Growth, explained Snap's plans to continue growing our global audience, increase Snapchatter engagement, and continue to drive long-term retention on Snapchat.“We continue to expand our reach in highly monetizable markets, such as North America, where we have grown to over 150 million monthly active users.”“At our current growth rate, we see a path for Snapchat to reach over 1 billion people in the next two to three years.”“Our service provides a sticky, compelling use case — fast, easy, fun visual communication with friends and family — and we have a proven track record of growing our Snapchat community… We think about growth in terms of three inputs: adding new Snapchatters, growing their engagement, and retaining them over time.”“Onboarding new Snapchatters at this important moment in their lives supports the long-term health of our community — we’ve found that when Snapchatters discover our service early on in their smartphone usage and start Snapping with their close friends, they are far more likely to remain daily active users on Snapchat.”“Today, Snapchatters over 35 are connecting with Snapchat more than ever before, with both DAU and content time spent growth for this cohort outpacing overall DAU and content time spent growth. This supplements our strong retention of Snapchatters as they naturally ‘age with’ us, growing our reach into older demographics.”“For the five years after a Snapchatter's first year on our service, annualized retention is approximately 90% on average. During critical moments in life — like starting at a new school, moving out on their own, or getting a new job — Snapchat offers a fast and fun way to connect with friends and deepen existing relationships, leading to strong engagement and retention across our service over time.”“We’ve built a large, growing, and engaged community in many of the most valuable geographies in the world, with a demographic that is difficult to reach elsewhere. We’ve done this by delivering durable value for our community and retaining them at high levels, and we still have a significant opportunity ahead to grow our community in both our core demographics and markets, and in newer ones.”Jack Brody, VP of Product, gave a deep dive into the Snapchat product itself and how we’re always looking to improve the Snapchatter experience.“By focusing on meaningful communication between friends, we set ourselves apart from other platforms that center almost entirely on content consumption. This unique approach leads to high frequency usage, deep engagement, and resilient retention. For example, here in the US, Snapchatters open Snapchat nearly 40 times per day, on average. [And] over 60% of Snapchatters who open Snapchat each day create Snaps.”“Today, 88% of Snapchatters who Snap or Chat to a friend will use the app every day for the next 7 days. And in the last year, the number of conversations between unique pairs of friends has grown by over 30%.”“Over the past 10 years, we’ve leveraged the success of visual communication as the foundation on which to build more and more value for our community. To do this, we’ve taken things people love, want, and need to do daily and worked to make them better through design and technology. By continuing to focus on daily behaviors, we’ve built a service that has incredibly deep engagement and drives long-term retention.”“Snapchatters love our Map, and over 300 million use it monthly. And because we offer a social map, not a navigation map, we have a very high frequency of use. Daily Map users open the map 6 times per day, on average, to see what their friends are up to and meet up.”“AR is a key driver of our community growth, increasingly drawing new users to Snapchat. We see that over 70% of Snapchatters who download Snapchat engage with AR during their first day in the app.”“To continue to improve the value of Friend Stories, we are focused on three primary initiatives. First, we are consistently improving our ranking and recommendation models to surface the most relevant Stories for Snapchatters.” “Second, we’re investing in tools to make it easier for Snapchatters to post to their Stories, in order to increase overall story availability among friends. The number of Snapchatters with at least one Friend Story available to view has increased by over 15% year-over-year.”“Finally, we’re constantly adding new features to provide additional value. We recently launched Communities, a product for private groups in which members can add friends and post to a shared Campus Story. We started with colleges and high schools and will be rolling it out to more communities over time. We’ve now onboarded 1,400 colleges in the US, and will continue expanding to more universities around the world.”“In the US, time spent per viewer for both Creator Stories and Spotlight have grown by large double-digit percentages in Q4 compared to last year. This is why we’re doubling down on creators… Spotlight is relatively new, yet its growth has been astounding. Spotlight already reaches over 300 million Snapchatters per month. In Q4, total time spent watching Spotlight more than doubled from the year prior, and Spotlight submissions are up nearly 20% over the same time frame.”“All of this has made us uniquely positioned to build a subscription service that offers new, exclusive, and experimental features directly to this extremely passionate audience. We’ve done this with Snapchat+, our $3.99-a-month subscription service. Launched last July, we already serve over 2.5 million subscribers.”Kenny Mitchell, Chief Marketing Officer, highlighted why Snapchat is so powerful for marketers, when brands should share their stories on the platform, and how advertisers can make their moments break through.Why: “We’re the antidote to traditional social media because we’ve built a place where we can freely share our perfectly imperfect moments with those closest to us.”“Snapchat is an authentic environment. A private environment. And best of all, it’s a happy environment. In fact, a staggering 91% of Snapchatters are happy when using Snapchat, and it is the happiest platform compared to our competitors.”“Snapchat is where real relationships create an environment where brands have real influence… When Snap Ads show up alongside the stories of your friends and family, or when you are sent a Snap from a friend with a Starbucks Lens, you are more receptive to that message and the recommendation hits a bit different. This is why Snapchat Ads provide increased relevance vs. other platforms, resulting in Snapchatters being 45% more likely to recommend brands and 34% more likely to purchase products advertised.”When: “Three key moments break through on Snapchat: Launches, Tentpoles, and Everyday Moments.”“Snapchat is the #1 platform where people enjoy sharing what their daily life is actually like — moments both big and small. In fact, nearly 40% of our top days on Snapchat in key markets aren't associated with a major holiday or moment. This connects well for brands with an always-on strategy. As our community shares their daily rhythms, brands too can bring joy to their potential consumers in small but impactful ways.”How: “Put simply, brands advertise in two ways on Snapchat: with full-screen video formats and immersive augmented reality. These are attention-driving ad formats that also drive performance, and they are always high quality and engaging.”“Take Snapchat’s vertical videos: They earn 5x more attention compared to the Social Video norm. That’s because Snapchat enables brands to tell their story in a brand-safe, curated, trustworthy environment where, as we noted, Snapchatters are happy and more receptive to messages.”“Brands are finding real success [with our AR Lenses]. For example, Snapchat’s augmented reality Lenses garnered 4x more attention than Dentsu’s benchmark.”“Snapchat is uniquely poised to help brands deliver on their long-term goals while delivering short-term results. We connect them to the right audience through a powerful and creative suite of advertising solutions. All that helps CMOs like me sleep better at night.”Jerry Hunter, Chief Operating Officer, discussed in detail how we are evolving both engineering and sales to drive performance for our advertisers.“Our priority for accelerating revenue growth is simple: to deliver measurable value and positive business outcomes for our advertising partners, with greater emphasis on direct response performance in the near term.”“To gain share of the very large and growing pie of digital ad dollars, we’re going to focus on a few things… 1) provide advertisers with a large and engaged audience that is difficult to reach elsewhere, 2) offer compelling, performant ad formats in a brand-safe environment, and 3) provide an ad platform capable of optimizing campaigns to deliver attractive return on ad spend for our advertising partners.”“We are investing aggressively in optimization, measurement, and ad ranking in particular, to drive measurable advertiser outcomes more efficiently. In this way, we believe we can increase CPM and increase ROI simultaneously.”“Our primary focus in the near term is direct response advertising, or DR. Today, DR represents approximately two-thirds of our ad business and has continued to grow at a faster rate than our brand-oriented business. We believe DR is resilient because it provides the most measurable ROI for advertisers, who need a high degree of confidence in their spend.”“​​To overcome the limitations imposed by the platform policy changes in a privacy-safe manner, we are updating and improving our ad platform across three key areas: 1) investing in observability and measurement, 2) improving engagement and conversions quality, and 3) increasing the volume of high-quality engagements and conversions.”“Conversions API adoption has been growing nicely, and the majority of our revenue is now measured using signals from Conversions API, Pixel integrations, SKAN, or MMPs.”“More than 30% of revenue is measured through Estimated Conversions, which encompasses both web-based DR advertisers and app-based DR advertisers via SKAN.”“We are working to enhance the quality of engagement and conversions… These changes will provide advertisers with better last-click conversion performance, and Snapchatters with better post-click experiences. For example, for campaigns optimized toward engagement, reach, and leads, improved click quality has led to a 40% increase in post-click view time, and a nearly 15% rise in the Google Analytics session match rate. And our ML model updates designed to deliver more relevant ads has led to a more than 40% improvement in ad view time, and a 25% increase in non-bounce rates.” “To fully realize our AR advertising opportunity, we are now identifying ways to grow the ecosystem – partnering with media agencies like WPP, Publicis, and Denstu to find new, scaleable ways to integrate AR into brands’ go-to-market strategies. And we are making it easier than ever to create, manage, and deploy AR advertising – through acquisitions like Vertebrae, which provides a backend system to create, manage, and deploy 3D and AR assets.”“As we think over the medium-term about continuing to grow our average revenue per user, we’ll be looking at different ways to help advertisers reach Snapchatters across more of our platforms, like the Snap Map, and, of course, opening up more inventory by monetizing Spotlight, which is growing very rapidly.”“While the Engineering and Product teams have been bringing revenue-generating features to the market, we haven’t had a tight feedback loop with our customers. These are technical implementations that usually need tuning and modification to ensure our customers are getting the best results. By investing in processes and teams that make the feedback loop tight, we have been able to improve the product more quickly.”“If there is one point you should take away, it is that we are evolving our ad platform, and while it’s early days, we are already seeing strong results.”Bobby Murphy, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, explained how we are accelerating our lead in augmented reality, how each of our investments in AR fit together, and why we are so excited about the future of AR.“We believe augmented reality represents the next major shift in computing. AR allows us to weave digital experiences into the world around us, evolving the way we use computing in our daily lives.”“Our AR products and services are driving major impact at scale today — on average, over 250 million people engage with augmented reality every single day on Snapchat. Our community plays with AR Lenses billions of times per day on average. And our AR creator community has built over 3 million Lenses using our Lens Studio software.”“This unique position has allowed us to develop a lead in augmented reality over the last decade by leveraging one of the world’s most-used cameras, developing advanced technology and tools, and growing a vibrant AR creator ecosystem.”“As we look ahead to the next five years, we'll build upon our early success with Camera Kit and create a business beyond Snapchat by allowing companies, developers, and entrepreneurs to solve their business needs through AR.”“AR is a massive part of our mobile Snapchat experience today, and over time, we see even greater opportunities for new hardware to bring it into another dimension. This is what is driving our development of Spectacles, our wearable AR device. Wearables are an important long-term opportunity, and we are seeing incredible early progress, with super-engaged early creators, rapidly advancing technology, and an increasingly clear view of how to develop the best, most usable, and most compelling AR device.”Derek Andersen, Chief Financial Officer, spoke about the financial progress we have made since our last Investor Day and discussed our plans to accelerate revenue growth for Snap in the years ahead. “Two years ago, we laid out a plan to achieve 60% gross margins over the medium term, or within two to three years. I am proud to share that we exceeded this goal ahead of schedule, and did so even while increasing our user growth and despite the headwinds on revenue.”“We invested heavily in operating expenses in 2021 as topline growth remained elevated. But, as growth slowed in 2022, we moved quickly to reprioritize our cost structure to reduce our expected future annual adjusted operating costs by $450 million and our total cash cost structure by $500 million. We’ve now executed this reprioritization over the last six months and expect to realize the full benefit of these cost reductions in Q1 of 2023.”“In 2021, we entered into exchange agreements with our debt holders to early convert more than $1.1 billion of our outstanding convertible notes into shares of Class A common stock when our shares were trading at approximately $64. This reduced our outstanding debt to approximately $3.7 billion as of now, with a weighted average coupon of just 24 basis points and weighted average maturity date more than four years into the future. Conservative and opportunistic management of our balance sheet, along with achieving positive free cash flow generation for two consecutive years, put us in a position to responsibly deploy $1.0 billion of capital to repurchase our own shares at historically low valuation levels. We repurchased shares equivalent to 6.7% of our common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022. As a result of these efforts, the rate of growth in our fully diluted share count went from 3.4% in 2020, to 1.2% in 2021, to 0.2% in 2022 after adjusting for the early conversions I noted earlier.”“As we look forward, we believe we have cleared a path to deliver Adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive FCF, even at low rates of topline revenue growth. While we are proud of the work we’ve done in this regard — and believe it is a critical input to establishing a higher floor under our enterprise value — it does not reflect our ambitions for our business. To achieve the full financial potential of our business, we must accelerate topline revenue growth.”“In the near term, we are focused on improving our direct response advertising platform to better capitalize on our already-immense reach and depth of engagement. We are making significant progress in this regard through deeper integrations with larger clients, improved click-through performance, and retraining our models to focus on measurable performance.”“Over the medium term, we believe that our track record of innovation positions us well to expand our ARPU opportunity and diversify our revenue sources over time. For example, Snapchat+ presents an entirely new source of revenue for Snap, and just six months since launch, it has reached more than 2.5 million subscribers and an annual revenue run rate of over $100 million.”“Before we finish up, I’d like to take a step back and bring together the broader picture of what the team has presented today as well as some of the most critical points we hope you’ll take away with you.The first is that we are well on our way to building a community of 1 billion monthly active users, with our core product of visual communication delivering significant reach into some of the most valuable markets in the world, and a young demographic that is difficult to reach elsewhere.Second, we have reprioritized our investments to ensure that our top strategic priorities are fully funded and have a clear path to deliver Adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow even at lower rates of revenue growth.Third, we are executing against our plan to improve our DR business in order to take share, even in a challenging operating environment.Fourth, we are innovating to drive growth in content engagement and are encouraged to see this strategy delivering clear results as demonstrated by the progress we are making with Spotlight, Creator Stories, and Community Stories.Fifth, we are making rapid progress toward diversifying our revenue sources, as evidenced by the remarkable early growth of Snapchat+.Last, we believe that AR will drive the next computing platform, and that our combination of leading AR technology, a well-established creator ecosystem, and a community deeply engaged with AR experiences, positions us well to be a leader in the next computing platform transition.”“Before we wrap up our presentation today, I would like to leave you with one final thought, which is that the most critical input to delivering on all of the strategic initiatives we laid out here today is innovation. That includes innovating on our products, our advertising platform, and the future of AR. We believe that our demonstrated track record of innovation over the last 12 years positions us well to deliver on this for our community, our partners, and our investors.”___This summary includes forward-looking statements.

In 2021, AR studio Paper Triangles made nearly $4 million building Lenses for brands – from makeup looks for Sephora to shoe try-on for Crocs. Live Nation worked with a number of AR agencies to enhance fan experiences at some of their largest festivals – plai brought Roofus to life at Bonnaroo, and GoSpooky lit up the sky with Rolling Loud’s iconic Punx characters. As our AR community grows their careers and businesses, we’re continually exploring how we can show our support. We’re now experimenting with a small group of creators and developers to build Lenses with digital goods, including power-ups, AR items, and extra tools within a Lens that Snapchatters can unlock with Snap Tokens. Over the coming weeks, these Lenses will roll out in select locations, and they’ll appear in the Lens Carousel and Lens Explorer alongside millions of Lenses built by Snap and our creator community. We look forward to learning about the long-term potential of digital goods alongside AR creators in this pilot program and with our broader Snapchatter community. Innovating with Snap AR We’ve built our platform so developers can join us in pushing the boundaries of AR further, faster. Over the past five years, we’ve taken the most innovative machine learning and computer vision technologies developed by our team, made these tools adaptable for a wide range of use cases, and wrapped them in an intuitive interface through Lens Studio. AR experiences are created and published in Lens Studio so that people can use them on Snapchat, in other apps through Camera Kit, or on our next-generation Spectacles. Lens Studio’s best-in-class suite of capabilities understand what’s in the camera’s scene, reflect how people interact naturally, and render AR elements realistically. With such a large tool chest of advanced technologies, there’s an endless number of combinations to create useful AR experiences for learning, shopping, wellness, and play. Parisian team Flat Pixel built Danger Bot, a fast-paced multiplayer AR game that challenges players to work together to defeat a robot.  While Beyond Studio, based in Amsterdam, built Hybrid Jacket, an immersive, futuristic fashion try-on experience. And Los Angeles-based Michael French created The Knowledge Pool, transforming the fountain at the Los Angeles Central Library into a series of interactive educational lessons, just by scanning your library card. These are just a few of the innovative Lenses from our first-ever Snap AR Lensathon earlier this year. Today at Lens Fest, we announced a new Lensathon, challenging creators to push what’s possible in AR. Now through January 31st, creators can submit Lenses to compete for a part of the $200,000 prize pool.AR is core to the Snapchat experience today, and over time, we see even greater opportunities for hardware to bring it to a new dimension. Our ambition is that AR can be even more natural through glasses that let you use your hands to interact with AR around you. Over the past two years, hundreds of developers from 30 countries have experimented with the next generation of Spectacles, building hundreds of Lenses right in Lens Studio – from learning to read music to saying what constellation you want to see.  The advanced hardware and software, distribution channels, and ways we support growth through the Snap AR platform all work together to fuel the creativity and businesses of our global AR community. We’re thrilled to celebrate those who are driving AR forward today."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/bitmoji-adidas-drop","date":"2022-12-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Snapchat introduces a first-of-its-kind Bitmoji Drop with adidas","text":"Snapchatters love showing off their fashion style via their Bitmoji, and we’re always looking for new ways to bring exclusive digital fashion items and apparel to our community who has created more than 1 billion avatars globally. Today, we’re excited to announce the first-ever Bitmoji Drop in partnership with adidas that allows Snapchatters to use Tokens to claim an exclusive adidas “Into The Metaverse” (ITM) track jacket. For a limited time only, Snapchatters can claim the exclusive adidas ITM track jacket in the brand’s recognizable yellow colorway for their Bitmoji, featuring the adidas web3 logo and black stripes on the sleeves.

Then, Lauren Cason, cofounder and Creative Director of RefractAR, took the stage to share more about the historical, useful, and playful AR experiences that she has built using Snap’s AR tools Lens Studio and Spectacles.Hi, My name is Bobby and I’m the cofounder and Chief Technology Officer at Snap. It is so great to be here today to talk about Augmented Reality. Augmented Reality is an incredibly exciting and hugely important area of focus for us at Snap.Snapchat, our flagship product, is a visual messaging app that opens to the camera and enhances our relationship with friends, family and the world. But what began as a visual messaging app over 10 years ago has expanded into a platform and an entrypoint for millions of Augmented Reality experiences.On Snapchat, 363 million people engage with our camera every day. To talk with real friends and loved ones. To try on a new outfit. To learn a new language. Or to see something new and surprising in the world around them.Experiences like these are used six billion times per day by our global community. And engagement and excitement around AR is only growing - By 2025, nearly 75% of the global population and almost all smartphone users will be frequent AR users.I’d like to talk about why we at Snap are so excited about Augmented Reality, and why so many people are engaging with it so frequently.First, AR is inherently a hyper-personalized visual format. In every other visual media format - pictures, videos, games - your experience is fully defined by a creator. But in AR, your experience is a composition of a creator’s imagination layered onto your own perspective.This means each experience is entirely unique - useful, relevant, and impactful - because you are at the center of it. You see a dragon landing on a building from your own point of view. Your face is transformed with a ridiculous crying expression. Your own hands are reflected as you learn sign language.As creators, this gives us the opportunity to think about developing content in a completely new way. In fact we’ve found over and over that the best and most engaging AR experiences really leverage this characteristic, by adding to your world rather than replacing it.And second, great Augmented Reality is designed and developed to be incredibly fast and convenient to engage with. It is enabled by remarkable advances in computer vision and computer graphics that make it possible to both understand and transform images and videos in very sophisticated ways.These models are able to perceive the names and shapes of objects in an image and render changes to that image in a fraction of a second. So fast, in fact, that we can understand and edit each frame of a video before the next frame appears.This represents a major step forward in our ability to create and interact with all forms of visual media. Images, videos, and live camera feeds can be understood, edited, enhanced, and augmented in real time.This level of performance allows us to do amazing new things with computing. We can interact with our world and get access to information much faster than we can with voice or keyboard inputs.Pulling up a menu by QR code, looking up wine ratings, or plant species, or getting help to solve a math problem are all use cases that are enabled through fast visual understanding. And we can visualize changes to our world in ways that would be impossible with much slower image and video editing tools.If I want to see what I’d look like in a new pair of glasses I can do that in AR. And the speed of AR means that if I want to see those same glasses on me from a hundred different angles, I can do that too, in an instant. In fact with AR, I could even try on many more pairs of glasses, faster than I could click through each of their product pages on a website or try them on in-store. And I’d come away with a much better idea of which of them is the perfect pair for me. Zenni Optical did exactly this, using our True Size technology. Through AR, their glasses have been tried on over 60 million times by Snapchatters.AR represents an opportunity to weave digital experiences into the world around us, and evolve the way we use computing in our daily lives.We are incredibly excited about where AR is today and where it will go in the future. And we see that excitement reflected in our community, with remarkable growth of engagement across hundreds of millions of people. Augmented Reality is not only a massive leap in our ability to transform and create visual media, but a major evolution in how we develop and distribute software experiences altogether - centered around the camera, hyper relevant and insanely fast. It is a massive part of our mobile experience on Snapchat today, and over time, we see greater opportunities for new hardware, like Spectacles, our wearable AR device, to bring it to a new dimension.We love sharing technology in development with our community and we have seen some amazing work already from creators on Spectacles. I’m honored to welcome Lens Creator Lauren Cason to the stage. She’ll be demonstrating the power of augmented reality through the lens experiences she’s so thoughtfully developed. And, in her own words, showing us why “we’re not waiting for the future with augmented reality, it’s already here.”For more, please follow the hashtag #EmTechMIT"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/strava-activity-lens","date":"2022-11-02T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Get Active With Strava’s New Lens on Snapchat","text":"Whether you love short walks, hikes, or marathon-length runs, the Strava app can help track fitness triumphs big and small.

In Germany alone, 6.3 million tons of plastic waste are produced every year.[1] The huge amounts of plastic waste are one of the main triggers for the climate crisis. Experts are aware of the effects, but many people in Germany know far too little about the plastic waste problem. We want to change that with the help of augmented reality. That's why we're launching the two AR experiences #PlasticGate and #PlasticWorld today, with which you can wrap your surroundings in plastic and make the problem visible. Share Snaps with your friends and help draw attention to the plastic waste problem. On the BUNDjugend website you can find more information on how the plastic flood is developing worldwide and how you can become active and get involved to help prevent this issue.#PlasticGate LensOne of Germany's most important landmarks is drowning in plastic waste: with the #PlastikGate AR lens, the Brandenburg Gate is transformed before your eyes into a memorial made of plastic bottles, shopping bags and plastic waste. If you are in Berlin, you can now easily try out the AR lens onsite. By pointing your smartphone at the Brandenburg Gate with the Snapchat camera open, you can unlock the experience. Behind it is our Landmarker technology, which transforms the world's most famous landmarks into creative AR experiences with the help of digital 3D models.#PlasticWorld LensFor those outside of Berlin, the #PlasticWorld Lens conveys a similarly oppressive feeling: via AR your own four walls sink into plastic waste in a fraction of a second. Simply scan the Snapcode and unlock the experience on your smartphone:To visualise digitally what would be impossible in analogue, we are using our new World Mesh technology for the first time in Germany for the #PlasticWorld Lens. With the help of machine learning, World Mesh brings LiDAR-like functions to mobile phones with normal cameras so that they can process depth in space and create three-dimensional, true-to-scale experiences. Both lenses initially open in selfie mode, which also shows you behind a plastic film that you can move via hand tracking. We are on a mission to raise awareness of this important topic to our Snapchat community and help give you a voice.Have fun trying them out!"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/fresh-fall-features","date":"2022-09-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Fresh Features for Fall!","text":"This Fall, we’re introducing new features to help keep conversations with friends fresh, fast, and easy to find!Our new Lock Screen Widgets, available now with iOS 16, keeps conversations with your bestie saved right to your lock screen so you can start chats with one tap.

The first Lens, called Skywalk, will transform the show’s setting through augmented reality, synchronized with the timing of the overall production. Attendees using the Lens will experience blossoming flowers emerging from the ground as soon as the first models walk down the runway. Then, the flowers will slowly float into the sky as a glowing moon appears as the show continues. During the finale, the petals will fall like confetti at the end of the catwalk. It leverages the latest Snap AR technology, including sky segmentation and surface tracking, to heighten the realism of the effects. The next Lens brings daylight shimmers and moonlit reflections to your face, highlighting the glow of the event. Snapchatters who want a taste of what it’s like to walk the Vogue runway will be able to from home with Lenses available globally on Vogue’s Brand Profile. Anyone can make their own fashion show as they show off their personal style through these Lenses. These experiences are built by Arcadia, Snap’s creative studio for branded augmented reality. Mark Guiducci, Creative Editorial Director of Vogue notes: “Vogue World: New York is a celebration of all the ways in which fashion is changing. It comes at a moment when designers have become multidisciplinary creators, innovating how we engage with fashion—even virtually.

That’s why we’ve made it a priority since 2016 to provide Snapchatters with in-app tools to learn about voting and local government, helping over 30 million access voting information in 2020, and empowering four million to learn about opportunities to actually run for office themselves in 2021.In 2020, with the help of our civic partners, we were able to help over 1.2 million Snapchatters register to vote, playing a part in the largest increase in youth voter turnout in decades and reaching groups of young voters who are often left behind. Research by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement’s (CIRCLE) found that during that election cycle, Snapchat’s tools especially helped register Black youth, as well as young Americans that are unlikely to have gone to college – groups that tend to be under-invested in by campaigns and organizations, and underrepresented in the electorate. But, we know there is much more work to be done.  The Snapchat generation still votes at substantially lower levels than older Americans, and many groups of young people are still underrepresented. CIRCLE’s “Growing Voters” report shows that to continue improving turnout, it is vital to engage and educate future voters earlier on in life, even before they are eligible to vote, and meet them where they are. CIRCLE also estimates that there are more than 8.3 million new eligible voters since the 2020 elections.That’s where Snapchat can help. As a platform that reaches 90% of 13-24-year-olds in the U.S., we have the opportunity to empower the Snapchat generation to be active and educated participants in this coming election season. So for 2022, we are building on our strong foundation of civic engagement efforts to do more.Our Suite of Tools for the 2022 U.S. ElectionWe know that one of the most important drivers of voting is encouragement from your family and friends, so we are empowering Snapchatters to organize their communities through a new activity-sharing feature in our redesigned Register to Vote tool. Partnering with BallotReady, we’ve built an in-app tool that helps Snapchatters register to vote – and allows 16- and 17-year-old Snapchatters to pre-register in select states where available. We also are launching an organizing hub within the tool that enables Snapchatters to reach out to friends who still need to register to vote.In addition, we are launching Voting 101 hub, which provides in-app instructional videos on how to register to vote, voter ID, become a poll worker and more. We have developed these tools in partnership with Nonprofit Vote, Vote Early Day, Power the Polls, BallotReady, Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights Under the Law, and VoteRiders. As always, we will leverage Augmented Reality to enhance the real world around us. Snapchatters will be encouraged to register and get out the vote through fun Lenses and Filters – and more importantly, encourage friends to do the same. Finally, we know Snapchatters love to offer their local perspectives with Snaps shared to our Map. During election season this year, our team of content curators will plan to feature local Map stories highlighting voter engagement content to help Snapchatters get out the vote in their communities.Providing Credible News and Preventing MisinformationWe also recognize that a big part of empowering Snapchatters to engage in the civic process is making sure that misinformation isn't allowed to spread on our platform. We have always maintained a commitment to ensuring that news and information on Snapchat is credible, from trusted and clear sources. This commitment starts with our platform architecture, which includes safeguards — like partnerships with accountable publishers on Discover, and review of user content before it’s eligible for amplification to large audiences on Spotlight — to prevent unvetted content from reaching a large audience. We have always partnered with trusted sources, like NBC News, Refinery29, VICE, and The Wall Street Journal, as well as continuing essential programming from Good Luck America. And as in previous election cycles, some of our Discover media partners will be including swipe up to register to vote links on their content.These safeguards — along with design choices that emphasize real-friend communication and creativity, while providing simple mechanisms for reporting harmful content — help reduce the reach of false information across our community. You can learn more about our approach here. We’re excited to build on our efforts to help continue to empower young people to get involved in civics and to empower them to build on the recent growth in youth voter turnout. We will look forward to continuing to work with our partners to help the Snapchat Generation continue to make their voices heard in this election."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/restructuring-and-refocusing-our-business","date":"2022-08-30T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Restructuring and Refocusing our Business","text":"Editor's note: Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel sent the following note to Snap Inc. employees on August 31.Dear Team,Thank you for your patience as we have worked through our 2023 financial planning and reprioritization process. Our forward-looking revenue visibility remains limited, and our current year-over-year QTD revenue growth of 8% is well below what we were expecting earlier this year. While we will continue our work to reaccelerate revenue growth, we must ensure Snap’s long term success in any environment. For planning purposes we have modeled a range of outcomes, some of which assume that low revenue growth continues into next year, and we have built our 2023 plan to generate free cash flow even in a low growth scenario.The investments we have made in our business to-date assumed a higher rate of revenue growth based on our vast opportunity and our proven history of execution, including 2x growth in the size of the Snapchat community and 10x growth in trailing twelve month revenue since our IPO in 2017. Unfortunately, given our current lower rate of revenue growth, it has become clear that we must reduce our cost structure to avoid incurring significant ongoing losses. While we have built substantial capital reserves, and have made extensive efforts to avoid reductions in the size of our team by reducing spend in other areas, we must now face the consequences of our lower revenue growth and adapt to the market environment.We are restructuring our business to increase focus on our three strategic priorities: community growth, revenue growth, and augmented reality. Projects that don’t directly contribute to these areas will be discontinued or receive substantially reduced investment. We have worked thoughtfully and deliberately to find the right balance between focusing our investments while continuing to innovate, and we have made the decision to discontinue our investments in Snap Originals, Minis, Games, and Pixy, among other areas. We have also started the process of winding down the standalone applications Zenly and Voisey.As a result, we have made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team by approximately 20%. The scale of these changes vary from team to team, depending upon the level of prioritization and investment needed to execute against our strategic priorities. The extent of this reduction should substantially reduce the risk of ever having to do this again, while balancing our desire to invest in our long term future and reaccelerate our revenue growth. Overall, the size of our team will remain larger than it was at this time last year.We will miss the many kind, smart, and creative team members who have contributed to Snap’s growth and I am deeply sorry that these changes are necessary to ensure the long term success of our business. The friendship and camaraderie we all share as a team make these changes particularly painful, and we will make every effort to treat our departing team members with the respect and gratitude that they deserve.Team leaders will notify their impacted team members as soon as possible and provide them with detailed guidance. In the United States, we will provide at least four months of compensation replacement, as well as financial assistance to enroll in COBRA, so that team members will have until the end of the year to find new opportunities while still receiving compensation and health benefits from Snap. Outside the United States, we will follow local processes required in each country and tailor compensation and benefits to reflect local norms with the intent to provide similar levels of support regardless of geography. We will also provide outplacement service support and launch an opt-in talent directory to help departing team members connect with new opportunities.We acknowledge that these changes may have a particularly serious impact on team members relying on work authorizations to live outside their home country, and we will provide these impacted team members additional support and flexibility to minimize disruption to their immigration status.We are also reorganizing our team to better meet the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment and to make as much progress as possible, as quickly as possible, in the areas of our business that we are able to control. In particular, there remains significant opportunity to improve coordination and prioritization across our engineering, sales, and product teams. In an effort to realize this opportunity, we are promoting Jerry Hunter to Chief Operating Officer, effective today. Jerry will lead our monetization efforts across our three operating regions (EMEA, APAC, and Americas), as well as our Growth, Partnerships & Content, AR Enterprise, and SMB teams. He will also continue to lead the Engineering teams that currently report to him. Jerry has repeatedly demonstrated operational rigor at scale, leading our business through several challenging transitions including the build out of our advertising platform, the rebuild of our Android product, our infrastructure optimizations, and most recently, significant investments in our Platform Integrity team. I believe Jerry’s promotion will result in both better short term execution as well as a higher velocity of long term innovation.We are also realigning our regional operational leadership by creating a new President role in each of the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions. Our three regional Presidents will provide in-market leadership, lead cross-functional efforts across our business, oversee local operational needs, and lead our go-to-market strategy. Ronan Harris, Vice President and Managing Director of UK & Ireland at Google, is joining Snap as President, EMEA, beginning in October. Ronan will join our executive team and report to Jerry. We are currently searching for Presidents for our APAC and Americas regions.I will give a presentation detailing these changes to our entire team tomorrow morning, and will plan on following up with “Ask Evan” shortly thereafter. My annual letter to the team will be distributed on Tuesday of next week and our Strategic Planning Process for 2023 will follow.Changes of this magnitude are never easy, and we must act decisively to meet this moment as a team. I am proud of the strength and resilience of our team as we have navigated the myriad challenges of growing our business in a highly competitive industry during uncertain and unprecedented times. Thank you for your dedication, hard work, and commitment to our community. Evan"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/dual-camera","date":"2022-08-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Be a Part of Every Moment With Snapchat’s Dual Camera!","text":"Snap’s Camera is one of the most used cameras in the world.

So, how does it work? Our researchers sourced several images and videos of an object, in this instance, for example, the Nefertiti Bust, from different angles. They used the NeRoic method to digitize the asset, eliminating the need for multi-view studio capture. This approach could unlock the ability for an AR creator or developer to digitize any object in the world, as long as there are photos or videos available of it found in an online image collection. This is a significant step towards the goal of creating a library of AR digital assets to overlay computing on the world.SNAP AT SIGGRAPHThis year's SIGGRAPH conference will take place at the Vancouver Convention Center where Snap will host a networking event for students and professionals working in computer graphics.

After meeting an incredible colleague, who was also the first person I met to disclose their disability, she opened my heart and eyes to the possibilities. I started to be myself, disabled and all – vulnerable, scared, but truly believing that I was a more considerate, empathetic, and better person because my disability made me, ME. This led to Emily Hui and I co-founding SnapAbility, Snap's first disability-focused ERG in 2019. Fast forward to now – I'm proud of my disability and have turned it into an additional perspective which I lend to everything I do. By leading DEIBA product initiatives at Bitmoji, I hope to continue with Snap on a path to create a world where every user feels seen and represented, in all the multi-faceted ways that make us human and kind.” - Rai Hsu, Brand Integrity and Customer Advocacy Lead “As a disabled person and a Diversity Manager at Snap, I am fortunate to help align our SnapAbility Employee Resource Group (ERG) with our Benefits team to resource and empower our employees to navigate how disabilities impact their day-to-day lives.

The experience also transforms the sky into the rainbow colours of the Pride flag. To experience the AR exhibit, visitors simply open their Snapchat and scan a rainbow-splashed Snapcode which can be discovered right outside our Snap-yellow building at 68 Old Compton Street, Soho from July 1st until August 14th. A playful, virtual tour guide called \"The Orb\" will direct Snapchatters through the exhibition experience as they discover the inspiration behind each artist and their artwork.Curated by V.O Curations, the exhibition includes the artworks of emerging LGBTQ+ artists, Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley, Flo Brooks, Emanuel de Carvalho, Guendalina Cerruti, Bernice Mulenga and Ebun Sodipo.“The opportunity to tell the stories of underrepresented and emerging LGBTQ+ artists through Snap’s AR technology is truly powerful and exciting. Pride Augmented: A Celebration of Queer Art is an exhibition geared towards creating a more inclusive LGBTQ+ community, a celebratory space for unique identities and a restorative one for those who have faced barriers in their day-to-day lives. The exhibition is a reminder to all of the importance of representing and amplifying queer voices.” Nnamdi Obiekwe, Co-Founder, V.O Curations.\"It’s our privilege to partner with VO Curations to showcase and celebrate the beautiful artwork of underrepresented, emerging artists from the LGBTQ+ community ahead of London Pride.

We believe one of the ways we can help remove some of those barriers is to provide mentorship and financial resources to emerging Black creators in the early stages of their professional career. Professional creators often have the education and tools necessary to monetize, request proper attribution and create ongoing opportunities.  Today, we are excited to announce our first accelerator program focused on supporting 25 emerging, undiscovered Black talent on their journey to make content creation a full-time career.We are accepting applications through August 12. To apply, visit: https://523.snap.com/apply. Participants will be selected by early September.We partnered with Google Pixel, UNCMMN, and Westbrook Media to support participants with some of the best devices, industry mentors, hands-on learning experiences and financial backing. Snap will provide funding of $10,000 USD per month per creator for 12 months to assist participants’ creative endeavors. These creators will be selected based on their unique voices, alignment with Snap’s values, and vision for their career without giving preference to follower numbers or previous brand partnership experience.These creators will also have the opportunity to Beta test new features; leverage Snapchat’s content offerings like Stories, Spotlight, Maps; and attend educational webinars and SnapSchool to ensure their success on the platform.The launch of this accelerator program is part of our broader, ongoing efforts to ensure that content on our platform reflects the diversity of Snapchatters and their interests. We recently announced 523, Snap's ecosystem of accelerators serving companies and creators from traditionally underrepresented groups.  Yellow is our accelerator program targeted towards entrepreneurs who are building businesses, brands, and products that can contribute to human progress by helping people. In our 2021 Yellow accelerator class, seven out of nine companies have at least one BIPOC or woman founder; 52% of our founders are BIPOC; and 56% are BIPOC-founded companies. Historically, across all of our classes, 22 out of 39 companies had at least one BIPOC founder (56%).With over 80% of the US Gen Z Population watching a Snap Original last year, Snap continues to elevate voices and topics that matter to our community. Over the past two years, over 50% of leads or hosts in Snap Originals have identified as BIPOC or LGBTQIA+.We are committed to elevating our community’s voices and can’t wait to see what they create!"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/cvpr2022","date":"2022-06-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"A Spotlight on Snap Research at CVPR 2022","text":"Snap’s Research team is kicking off the week in New Orleans at the 2022 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference. This year at CVPR, our team will share seven new academic papers, alongside the world’s leading researchers, that show breakthroughs across image, video, object synthesis and object manipulation methods.We’ve worked closely with interns and external academic institutions on this work to make significant gains in video synthesis technology. These developments can ultimately inform what we bring to our community of Snapchatters around the world. The work presented in our papers is based on the following developments: Our team has built implicit video representations, resulting in state-of-the-art video synthesis on a variety of tasks, while maintaining modest computational requirements. We then introduce two new problems in the domain: multimodal video synthesis and playable environments.For example, the CLIP-NeRF paper was a collaborative research effort to study the manipulation of Neural Radiance fields. Neural Radiance fields make it possible to render objects using neural networks, without needing sophisticated graphics pipelines. Findings from this work can help inform improvements to the ways digital assets are created for use in augmented reality experiences. And, this PartGlot paper explores how machines can better understand shapes and objects around us using language models.We’re excited about the potential of this work to unlock the creativity of our community and creators across our products and platforms in the future.GOING TO CVPR?

Read the executive summary and the full report here. We published our first CitizenSnap Report in 2020 as a way to better explain the way we operate our business and support our team, our community, and our partners – as well as, more broadly, our society and planet. As we continue to learn, grow, and iterate, we have published a report every year to increase transparency and hold ourselves publicly accountable in these areas. In a year that has been defined by change and global uncertainty, we have focused our efforts around building trust, scaling empathy, and leading with our values.We build trust with our community by continuing our ongoing efforts to create technology that serves humanity, from augmented reality experiences that help Snapchatters learn American Sign Language to civic tools that help our next generation of leaders make a positive impact by running for public office. We scaled empathy with our team and partners by working to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into our core business, launching our first content accelerator to support minority-owned creatives and media companies, and helping to launch the Action to Catalyze Tech (ACT) Report to bring over 30 technology companies, DEI experts, advocates and researchers together to drive industry-wide accountability. And because our shared prosperity depends on our ability to address the environmental crisis, we upleveled our commitments to reduce our business impact and used our platform to help Snapchatters better understand how to take action.We led with our values by sharing how we build safety and privacy into the design of our platform and products, and more importantly, how we’re improving in areas where we fall short. Since our early days, we have taken responsibility for the impact that our technology can have on society, and constantly think about changes we can make when we see our products being used in ways that aren’t aligned to our values. There’s no doubt that we still have an overwhelming amount of work to do, and we will keep striving to live up to our values of being kind, smart, and creative in all aspects of how we operate. We know our responsibilities extend far beyond the compliance laws we are required to abide by, and will keep doing our part to make a positive impact on our broader world. We believe that this isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the only way for Snap to succeed in the long-run."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/shared-stories","date":"2022-05-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Shared Stories Turn Shared Moments to Shared Memories","text":"Today, we’re introducing Shared Stories, a new way for Snapchatters to build community around the content they love to Snap. Shared Stories is a new iteration of Custom Stories, a product that previously allowed Snapchatters to create a Story and add friends to view and contribute. Now, with our new and improved Shared Stories, Snapchatters who’ve been added to the group can add their friends as well, making it easier for the whole soccer team, camp squad, or group of new coworkers to get in on the fun.  Like with all of our products, we’ve built this feature to be safe by design. For example:Like all Stories on Snapchat, Snaps sent to a Shared Story delete after 24 hours. Unlike regular friend Stories and Groups, there is no chat component, keeping all conversations between friends.Content is moderated with care, using a combination of automatic language detection and new community review tools that empower Snapchatters to play an active role in keeping Snaps in Shared Stories safe and fun. We also notify Snapchatters if they’ve joined a Shared Story with someone they’ve blocked. This gives Snapchatters the opportunity to leave the Shared Story, and ensures Snapchatters are always in complete control over who they share content with on our platform. With this next generation Story, we’re hoping to help Snapchatters turn shared moments into shared memories.

Today, we’re releasing our 2022 Diversity Annual Report, which shares our 2021 workforce data, important learnings about this work as well as the progress we’re making towards our representation goals. You can read the report and watch our videos here. Last year after the emotional outpouring following George Floyd’s murder, we shared our ambition to change hearts and minds. Now, we’re working towards fully operationalizing our efforts and making progress towards our critical representation goals. In this important work, we know that it’s easy to dream big, but that it's much harder to bring big dreams to life. So how are we doing? When it comes to our workforce representation, we’re still falling short of our goals. We hope this report is an honest acknowledgement of where we are, where we’re trying to go, and how we plan to get there.We also understand that these shortcomings are a broader reflection of many issues facing the tech industry. That’s why in 2020 we brought together a coalition of leading DEI experts across academia and business to create a new blueprint for tech companies to take bold, collective action. Together we released the Action to Catalyze Tech (ACT) Report in October 2021, which was backed by more than 30 leading tech companies as signatories.  Part of our ongoing opportunity is how we continue to inspire teams to tackle these hurdles over the long haul even when the work does not bring immediate results. We believe the solution will be achieved in part through culture, accountability, and sparking intrinsic motivation. We also understand that DEI is a marathon without a finish line and to drive systemic change we all need tools, inspiration, expertise, and incentives to stay in the race. We know that it's likely to get harder before it gets easier. Although our results don't always reflect our enormous efforts, we’re not giving up – instead, we’re doubling down to make Snap more inclusive and accountable and continuing to positively contribute to the technology industry as a whole. Evan & Oona"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/new-snap-originals-may-2022","date":"2022-05-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Lights!

The community has tapped into their creativity and technical skills to build over 2.5 million Snapchat Lenses that have been viewed over 5 trillion times. Creators are building careers and fully-fledged businesses with our technology, and we’re continually offering new ways to support their endeavors. From the Snap Lens Network to GHOST, our programs provide funding, early access to new tools, and greater reach to Snapchatters globally.     They’re also building a future beyond mobile with our next generation Spectacles. Hundreds of developers are using new capabilities like hand tracking, VoiceML, and Connected Lens technology to build new ways of interacting with AR. New AR ToolsAll of their creation and exploration begins with Lens Studio. Today, we’re releasing a new version so developers can build Lenses that are more dynamic and look true to life. With our API Library, Lenses can surface real-time financial, translation, and weather data from partners, ultimately making more useful and rich AR experiences. We’re expanding the API Library with new partners AstrologyAPI and Sportradar, so Lenses can tap into frequently-updating information like daily horoscopes and live sports scores. We’re also improving our Lens Analytics feature with Event Insights, offering creators a look at what happens while their Lenses are in use. We hope this makes it easier for creators to debug issues and build experiences that bring people back again and again. And coming soon, Ray Tracing will let reflections shine from AR objects in a lifelike way. It’s the first time this feature will scale across a wide range of mobile devices, enabling console-quality realism across platforms. Partners like Tiffany & Co. will bring a signature piece into AR that sparkles with precision, while Disney and Pixar will take Buzz Lightyear's iconic space suit to infinity and beyond in an AR try-on Lens.As developers push the limits of AR creation, we want to empower them with an advanced suite of services that vastly expands what a Lens can do. So, we’re introducing Lens Cloud, a free collection of backend services that enables Lenses to be more useful, dynamic, and connected to the world than ever before. There are three main services: Multi-User Services lets groups of friends interact together at the same time within the same Lens.Location-Based Services anchors Lenses to places using our city templates, or any custom location around the world. Central London is the first City Landmarker available now, with more launching over the next year. Storage Services make it possible to build complex and interactive Lenses by storing assets in our cloud, and call on them, on-demand. Snapchatters will also be able to pick up where they last left off through persistent data support. Storage Services will launch in the coming months. We’re excited to see how developers leverage Lens Cloud and Lens Studio together to build a new generation of AR experiences that enhance the way we play, learn, explore, and shop. Camera Kit The Snap AR platform not only powers Lens experiences on Snapchat and Spectacles, but also in other mobile applications through Camera Kit. With our AR SDK, any developer or partner can leverage Snap’s Camera technology in their own mobile app, unleashing new ways for AR to bring a new dimension to their customer experience. Camera Kit has been adopted by a wide range of partners – from global brands like Samsung, Disney, and Microsoft’s Flipgrid, to developers building an app for the first time. This year, we’ll continue to work with new partners to integrate Camera Kit, develop new use cases, and push the boundaries of AR. With new Lens capabilities, tools, and infrastructure, we can’t wait to see how the Snap AR community continues to prove the value and impact that AR can have on the world."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/sps2022creators","date":"2022-04-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"SPS 2022: Introducing Director Mode","text":"Content creators play a critical role on Snapchat, sharing their perspectives and entertaining our global community.We have tools and support for all kinds of content creators to grow their audience and build their business - whether they’re just getting started or are a professional creator.

Then, developers pass their work through our system which uses a code compiler to establish a secure sandbox environment around each designated social element within the Mini experience. When a Snapchatter goes to launch the Mini, Snap’s database populates the social elements, just as the interface is rendered for the Snapchatter on screen. With the Minis Private Components System, our partners can create experiences built around friendship, without the hassles, risks, and responsibilities of managing their communities’ friend graphs. To start, we are working with early partners like HBO Max, virtual greeting card company Givingli, and mobile data & minutes provider Ding. If you’re a developer and interested in building a Mini with our new Private Components System on Snapchat, you can learn more at https://minis.snapchat.com.We can’t wait to see what you will create!"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/sps2022livenation","date":"2022-04-27T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"SPS 2022: Snap and Live Nation Partner To Enhance Concerts and Festivals with AR","text":"For years, video screens have been a canvas for visual expression at concerts and festivals around the world.

Since January of last year, more than 250 million Snapchatters have engaged with AR shopping Lenses more than 5 billion times – trying on and visualizing products from brands and retailers around the world. They rank Snapchat the #1 platform for sharing shopping moments. Our brand partners are using Snap’s camera capabilities to engage their audience and transform businesses of all sizes. For example, Zenni Optical’s AR Lenses, which used our true-to-size eyewear Lens technology, have been tried on over 60 million times by Snapchatters and drove a 42% higher return on ad spend compared to Lenses without. Today, we are continuing to evolve AR shopping by launching a suite of new offerings making AR creation simple, fast, and cost-effective for businesses. And, we’re offering consumers new places to shop using AR, both on and off Snapchat.New AR Creation Suite Snap’s 3D Asset Manager is a web content management platform that makes it easy for businesses to request, approve, and optimize 3D models – for any product in their shopping product catalog. And through asset sharing capabilities, retailers and brands can utilize approved 3D models from well-known brands already in Snap’s asset management system. Partners can also use our new AR Image Processing technology. Developed by Forma, this capability allows businesses to leverage existing product photography they have produced for their ecommerce websites and transform them into turnkey AR-ready assets for Snapchat AR try-on Lens experiences. Through this technology, shoppers can try on even more outfits more easily, from the comfort of their own home, simply by taking a full body selfie. Step 1: Partners upload their existing product photography for product SKUs they currently sell on their websites. Step 2: Product photography is processed with a deep-learning module that transforms retailer’s photography into AR Image assets. Step 3: Businesses can then select SKUs with AR Image Assets to create try-on Lenses using new templates in a simple web interface.Snap’s new AR Shopping templates in Lens Web Builder also make it fast and free for brands to import their assets and create catalog-shopping Lenses in minutes, with no AR development skills needed. Available today in a beta for select partners, apparel, eyewear and footwear brands can join beauty merchants in building virtual try-on and visualization experiences using their AR-ready assets. We are also expanding into surface objects for categories like furniture and handbags, where our new template enables any 3D model to be placed on the floor or tabletop, allowing Snapchatters to explore items in more detail or see how it fits in their space. These three new technologies enable businesses of all sizes to create AR Shopping experiences quickly and easily – bringing personalized, immersive shopping opportunities to shoppers.  Dress Up Snapchatters love using AR for shopping, so we’re unveiling a new, dedicated destination on Snapchat called Dress Up. Dress Up brings together the best of AR fashion and try-on experiences from creators, retailers and fashion brands all in one place.  Available in Lens Explorer, and soon just one tap away from the Camera in the AR Bar, Dress Up invites our community to browse, discover, and share new looks from around the world. Snapchatters can also easily return to the outfits and accessories they love by navigating a new shopping section within their Profile where they can locate products they have favorited, recently viewed, and added to their cart. Any brand’s Lenses will be considered for Dress Up if they’re available on their Brand Profile. Camera Kit for AR ShoppingFinally, Camera Kit for AR Shopping is a new offering for businesses to bring the Snap Camera and AR try-on to their own applications. This SDK brings catalog-powered Shopping Lenses into retailers and brands’ product detail pages, so any customer can use Snap AR to try-on or visualize products, like eyewear or handbags, directly from their owned and operated applications. Camera Kit for AR Shopping works across Android and iOS, and will soon work on websites too. Puma is Snap’s first global brand partner to use the technology. Shoppers will be able to digitally try-on Puma sneakers, all powered by Snap’s Camera Kit.Shopping on and off Snapchat is incredibly easy and fun for both brands and shoppers.

You can watch the full video hereHi everyone, and welcome to the 4th Annual Snap Partner Summit!We’ve got lots of exciting things to share with you today.But first, let me just say that it is so great to be here with all of you in Los Angeles.Thank you all so much for your partnership. We’re having a ton of fun working together with you. And now, what was once a far off vision for computing overlaid on the world through augmented reality, is possible today through our camera.It’s such a joy to serve our community of over 600 million people, with more than 300 million daily active users around the world.We now reach more than 75% of 13-34 year olds in over 20 countries. And our global community continues to grow, with three consecutive years of accelerating year-over-year Daily Active User growth. Snapchat has changed a lot over the years, and our camera has become far more powerful – evolving from a way to communicate visually in a Snap into an augmented reality platform.On average, people interact with augmented reality Lenses on Snapchat 6 billion times per day, using computing in totally new ways through our Camera.Today, we’re dedicating our Snap Partner Summit to our team members in Ukraine. Ukraine is the birthplace of Looksery, the company that laid the foundation for our augmented reality platform.The products and services we are sharing with you today would not be possible without the creativity and ingenuity of our Ukrainian team members, and our hearts have been broken by the war that has taken so many innocent lives.We pray for peace in Ukraine.Augmented reality is important because it combines the power of computing with what we see and experience right in front of us in the real world. It allows us to use computing in a familiar environment, weaving technology seamlessly into our lives.Our augmented reality technology began as a playful tool for self-expression, but it has become so much more through the innovation of our partners. Creators and developers are building a range of AR experiences that give our community the ability to learn new languages, experience live events like never before, build monuments that tell previously untold stories, and easily try on a new pair of sneakers.Our investments in augmented reality represent our ongoing efforts to build technology that serves humanity and that feels intuitive and familiar to use.  We started by opening Snapchat into the camera to empower self-expression. Then, we made digital communication ephemeral, just like how we communicate in person, and focused on connecting real friends. We’ve always wanted people to feel comfortable expressing their full range of human emotion. As a result, over 90% of Snapchatters say they feel comfortable, happy, and connected when they use Snapchat. (1)And Snapchat is ranked the #1 happiest platform when compared to other apps. (2)Over the years, we’ve continued to evolve the ways that our partners can build for Snapchat and reach our audience with augmented reality experiences, content, games, and more. Increasingly, our partners are bringing Snap technology into their own apps and services, using Snap Kit, Camera Kit, and Bitmoji integrations. We now work with over half a million partners, creators, and developers to provide our community with innovative products and services. Already, more than 250,000 creators have built over 2.5 million Lenses that have been viewed over 5 trillion times. There are now over 700 Discover partners in 21 countries, and last year, over half a billion Snapchatters watched Shows on Discover. Time spent watching Spotlight continues to grow and people now submit 5 times as many Snaps to Spotlight per week on average when compared to a year ago.Since launch, more than 340 million Snapchatters have used Games and Minis. And our first two Layers on Snap Map, Memories and Explore, have been used over 100 million times since launch.Snap Kit developers and partners are helping Snapchatters express themselves. Over the past year, Snapchatters have shared content from our partners' apps, like songs from Spotify or tweets from Twitter, over 6 billion times on Snapchat. We’ve also been working with partners to support the next generation of young leaders who are trying to make a positive impact.Last October, we partnered with 10 nonprofits to help Snapchatters learn more about how to make a difference in their local communities by running for public office.With encouragement from friends and support from our partner organizations, our Run for Office Mini is a fun and impactful way for Snapchatters to learn more about local leadership. Snapchatters can nominate friends to run for office and explore local positions, sorted by the issues they care about — all in one centralized campaign dashboard.Over 4 million people have already used the Run for Office Mini. With over 25,000 sign-ups with one of our partners, Snapchatters are already taking steps to launch their campaigns. We are so inspired by the passion, creativity, and optimism of the Snapchat community and all of our partners.

We’re excited to say that these stickers have been shared over 30 million times. Through the launch of these stickers, we’ve seen positive reactions and engagement with our products, and received additional feedback from people who wanted to see themselves in more parts of Snapchat. Bitmoji’s mission is to be the world’s avatar, which also means that we want to ensure that all of our communities are reflected in our products.

After getting into a senior class his junior year, Leighton worked on a project rendering models of underground pipes using AR and three-dimensional modeling, and he was later invited to London to showcase the design. Now, in addition to his art and his work forecasting trends for major apparel brands, Leighton also has a freelance business creating augmented reality experiences and he is one among a group of developers working on new experiences for Snapchat’s latest Spectacles. His latest Lens, Blacksoul Gallery, which can be viewed on mobile as well, highlights the work of emerging Black artists, bringing their work to new audiences outside the traditional walls of museums and galleries. “At first, I wanted to make an AR game, but that wasn’t touching me in my soul,” said Leighton when asked about his inspiration. In addition to its impact in the digital space, Blacksoul Gallery is also helping build connections IRL. Today, Leighton remains close friends with the artists he found and featured. In fact, his Lens even served as a platform for these artists, who have gone on to work on new partnerships, projects and commissions after being featured in Blacksoul Gallery on Snapchat.This year, Leighton McDonald was recognized at our first ever Lens Fest Awards for his outstanding work using AR as a powerful force for representation with Blacksoul Gallery.

She got her start in theater, and even after winning several awards for her playwriting, she felt frustrated by some of the industry’s outdated formats, and was eager to find a new and innovative way to share her stories. After turning to her computing-oriented brothers, she figured she would try to channel her creativity through digital mediums. Soon she found herself working in illustration and animation, developing interactive experiences for a range of businesses and organizations from mobile gaming studios, to universities, motor-vehicle companies and beyond. While she’d dabbled with AR before, it wasn’t until two years ago that she rediscovered AR and was pleasantly surprised at how far the technology had come. With tools like Lens Studio at her disposal that allowed her to create AR experiences independently without a team of developers, she dove in head first. Now, she is one among a select group of developers creating new experiences for Snapchat’s latest Spectacles. Her latest Lens The Door allows viewers to choose their own adventure, creating their own evolving song triggered by hand tracking technology. “The Lens really positions the viewer as an artist at the center of the experience,” said Heather.In addition to her own AR creations, Heather is passionate about growing the AR industry and making the field more inclusive.

We welcome everyone to join us virtually for sessions over the coming days.We’re delighted by this engaged and highly technical community. For years, our creators have shared our belief in the power of AR and its ability to improve the world we all live in. Together, we’ve been building remarkable experiences that have evolved the way Snapchatters play, learn, explore, shop, and even make art. Today, we announced there are over 250,000 Lens Creators from more than 200 countries and territories. They include developers, brands, and partners who leverage the power of the Snapchat Camera and our tools like Lens Studio. Their pace of development is incredible. They’ve made more than 2.5 million Lenses that have been viewed by Snapchatters now more than 3.5 trillion times. And over 300 creators have reached more than a billion views on one of their Lenses. With Snapchatters playing with AR an average of more than 6 billion times per day, we want to continue helping Lens Creators push the boundaries of what’s possible through the Snapchat Camera. We also highlighted new, advanced capabilities for Lens Studio and our next generation Spectacles, and more ways to help creators build their careers and businesses on the Snap AR platform:Lens StudioAll Lens creation starts with Lens Studio, whether designed by our community or our team at Snap. From there, Lenses can be featured across Snapchat, Snap Camera, Spectacles, or into other apps through Camera Kit. Over the last year, we’ve taken some of the most innovative technologies developed by our team at Snap, and brought them to Lens Studio. Features like garment and skin segmentation, 3D Body Mesh, and VoiceML have already given AR creators and developers brand new capabilities to build more engaging, realistic, and accessible experiences.Starting today, now creators can build with:A New Sounds Library -- Creators can add Snapchat’s licensed music and audio clips to their own Lenses, choosing from millions of songs. Real-World Physics -- AR elements appear and react more realistically to forces of physics like gravity and collisions. World Mesh -- Any creator can use depth information and world geometry understanding to create experiences that look and feel more like they’re part of the real world, previously only possible with higher end devices, making Lenses like the below Matrix world possible API Library for Real-Time Data -- Smart and useful Lenses are easier to create with real-time information pulled from other sources, from the U.S. stock market, to weather data. We’re starting with APIs from partners including FTX, Alpaca, Accuweather, and iTranslate.  And coming soon, creators will be able to make Custom Landmarkers, transforming local landmarks into AR attractions. All it takes is a mobile device with a LiDAR Scanner to map the area and create a 3D model to bring into Lens Studio. We’re excited to soon hand over our Landmarker mapping technology and let creators turn more of the world—from statues to storefronts—into their canvas.Resources and Monetization We’re continuing to find ways to support our growing creator community and their big ideas. A new Lens Call-To-Action feature lets creators include a link within a Lens, making it easy to drive Snapchatters to a destination like a shop. Our Gifting platform allows Snapchatters to support and send their love to Lens Creators through Story Replies. And, Ghost, our AR innovation lab, is accepting new applications on a rolling basis. Developers and small teams who want to explore the technical and creative possibilities of AR can apply and receive a grant of up to $150,000 for each project, as well as support directly from the Snap team. SpectaclesWe introduced Spectacles over five years ago as a fun, hands-free camera designed to help capture your perspective and stay in the moment. Since then, we’ve taken an iterative, public approach to improving each generation and learning alongside the community. Now, our next generation Spectacles (with AR display) have helped creators make hundreds of Lenses that bring new perspectives to things we do everyday: Learn -- See the effects of global warming first hand with Save the Reef by Visionaries 777. Or, travel through time to experience Boston’s history right where it happened in an AR History Lesson by Yusuf Omar and Lauren Cason. Shop -- Try on AR clothing with Exodus by Damara Ingles, and imagine eating at a restaurant with a menu that comes to life with AR Menu by Brielle Garcia. Experience Art -- Interact with three-dimensional art to unlock new soundscapes in The Door by Heather Dunaway Smith. Or, visit an art gallery in AR with BlackSoul Gallery by Leighton McDonald. Play Games -- Run through a playful obstacle course hands-free with Monke Racing by Lucas Rizzotto. Or take care of your very own pet called Rocket Cat by Wabisabi. We’ve been listening to the feedback from the creator community, and from those insights, we’ve already developing advanced, new capabilities that creators can tap into:Connected Lenses -- These experiences make it possible for multiple people to share the same Lens with others in the same space on Spectacles. Location Triggers -- If you choose to enable location, Lenses can adapt based on a specific GPS radius, so experiences can be customized based on location.Endurance Mode -- This feature lets Lenses run longer by turning off the display in between interactions with the Lens. If you’re an AR creator looking to explore the potential of immersive AR, let us know. With so many people turning their attention to the future of immersive computing, we’re thrilled to celebrate our vibrant, global Lens Creator community who are already building the future of augmented reality on the Snap AR platform."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/523-snap","date":"2021-12-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Introducing 523","text":"We founded Snapchat to help people express themselves authentically, creating a space where they could connect with their real friends and learn more about the world around them.

The report calls for a coalition to solve the acute lack of computer science (CS) teachers in part by funding endowed centers of excellence for CS teaching in colleges that will create the largest number of Black and Hispanic/Latinx CS teachers. As part of the launch of the report, the Catalyze Tech coalition announced that $20 million in new funding is being pledged to four teaching colleges — a commitment that we hope will grow to support more schools across the country.Today, ahead of the first-ever virtual DEI Innovation Summit, we are sharing more details about the first four recipients of the initial $20 million funding:California State University, Dominguez Hills and Georgia State University will each receive $5 million from Snap Inc. University of Florida and University of Texas at El Paso and will each receive $5 million from philanthropist Ken Griffin, Founder and CEO of Citadel Capital, and Hopper Dean Foundation, respectively.These gifts, with support from CSforALL, a nation-wide non-profit that aims to strengthen computer science education, will support each institution’s School of Education and focus on the upskilling of faculty, future course development, and help fund local community partnerships with school districts supporting black and Hispanic/Latinx communities. Each of these commitments will help support over 1,000 new educators annually, who have a collective potential of impacting more than 1,000,000 students over the course of their teaching career.  We know this work is only the start and hope more companies and organizations will join us in following the ACT Report’s recommendations.

We believe the tech industry must work together to find collective solutions that drive deep, systemic change.For this reason, in early 2020 Snap convened a group of leading DEI experts, think tanks, and academics. After meeting biweekly for a year, I’m thrilled our coalition has today released The Action To Catalyze Tech Report. The ACT Report calls on tech companies to commit to bold, collective action by open sourcing DEI best practices, and collaborating on systemic solutions. ACT Report provides a blueprint for action that businesses at all stages -- from startups to mature companies -- can implement to drive change. As part of the pledge, all company signatories commit to developing company-specific strategies to pursue or enhance activity around the four ACT Report recommendations:Model and incentivize inclusive leadership: recognize DEI as a business imperative;Operationalize DEI throughout the business: apply a DEI framework to how different groups are impacted by HR systems (hiring, promotion, retention); how money is spent (supplier diversity), and how products are designed and built (product inclusion);Share DEI demographic data with a proposed industry body, the Tech Equity Accountability Mechanism, incubated by the Aspen Institute, with the goal of creating industry wide standards to track and measure progress; Transform future pathways into tech for underrepresented talent: help tackle deep-seated educational inequalities that lock underrepresented groups out of tech. Over 30 CEOs from leading technology organizations including Airbnb, Apple, Cisco, Dropbox, Etsy, Google, LinkedIn, Netflix, Twitter, Salesforce, Snap, Spotify, Uber and many others have committed to be founding signatories of the ACT Report. Together, these founding signatories represent more than 1,000,000 tech employees.

Today we are proud to take that strategy a big step further by committing to achieve Net Zero -- removing from the environment as much carbon as we emit each year -- and then going beyond Net Zero to make Snap net negative by 2030, meaning we will remove more carbon than we are emitting.We’re announcing this commitment because the latest science has made clear that more needs to be done to avoid climate change’s worst impacts. Our products have significant reach with younger generations, who care passionately about combating climate change. We feel a deep responsibility to take action at a pace and scale that can make a difference. Among other things, we think that includes committing to Net Zero (and beyond) and we have joined 200+ other businesses in signing The Climate Pledge and committing to Net Zero, regular reporting, carbon elimination, and credible offsets. We recognize that the market for carbon removal is unpredictable, that relevant indirect emissions can be difficult to calculate, and that we may have to revisit these commitments over the years as conditions change. But we commit to achieving these goals to the best of our ability and being transparent about our progress and any challenges we face. As part of this larger strategy, we’re also committed to helping educate our Gen Z audience on Snapchat about the climate crisis and actions they can take, through both original content and augmented reality experience. We regularly do research with our Gen Z community to better understand the issues they care about and want to see represented on the platform, and climate change and the environment are among the issues that rank highest. On average over 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR on our platform every day.Today we’re announcing a new Snap Original, “Planet Rewild,” produced by Re:wild and Underknown. This series was developed as part of a larger multi-year partnership between Snap and Re:wild, focused on bringing Re:wild’s mission to \"protect the wild that's left and restore the rest” in-app, allowing Snapchatters to learn, explore and uncover some of the most pressing threats to nature and our own survival. Planet Rewild, which will premiere in 2022, depicts what the Earth will look like in the coming decades if we don’t learn to “rewild” our planet -- and also offers a vision of the flourishing ecosystems that could emerge if we allow the wild to be restored. We don’t need to reinvent the planet; we need to rewild it. And to continue leveraging the storytelling power of AR for this critical issue, in 2022 we will continue our partnership with the United Nations Environmental Programme to create AR lenses to mark World Environment Day and Earth Day. This is an ongoing, long-term commitment from us and we look forward to building on these efforts in the months and years ahead."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-google-pixel","date":"2021-10-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Say Hello to the Snapchat Camera on the Lock Screen of Google's Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro","text":"We’re always looking for ways to innovate around our Camera and help our community Snap everyday moments, as they happen.

Over the course of the afternoon students discussed mental health and self care tips with Club Unity board members Halima Aden, Chloe x Halle, Rickey Thompson, Trae Young, Maddie Ziegler, and Yusuf Omar, and participated in breakout sessions led by Active Minds. For the keynote event, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy joined Snap CEO Evan Spiegel for a conversation on the ways young people can support one another in their mental health journey. In addition, they discussed how our physical health and mental health are often intertwined especially when it comes to substance abuse, and the role tech platforms can play in supporting the mental wellbeing of young people. From Snap’s earliest days, we have been inspired by the power that real friendships have in determining health and happiness. It is why we designed Snapchat to empower young people to express themselves authentically. And as a platform built for communicating with your closest friends, we believe Snapchat has a unique opportunity to make a difference and have built in-app resources and features to support our community. In celebration of World Mental Health Day, Snap has expanded its in-app mental health resource hub, Here For You, with new resources from Active Minds focused on how to start tough conversations with friends, active listening tips, and affirmations. These resources easily surface to Snapchatters when they search common mental health terms like anxiety, depression, and stress, and are designed to be easily shared with close friends and family so Snapchatter can help support one another through the highs and lows. You can watch Evan Spiegel’s conversation with the U.S. Surgeon General in full here and read highlights below:Dr. Murthy on the ways to address the stigma surrounding mental health: The longer we don't confront (our mental challenges), the longer they persist and more deeply they can affect us. But on the other hand, if we address our mental health challenges early on, we can actually turn them into strengths. They can make us more open and vulnerable and able to connect with other people. They can make us more empathic and more understanding of the challenges that other people go through. Dr. Murthy on how mental health intersects with substance abuse:There is a very strong connection between our mental health and substance use disorders...when people struggle, in fact, with greater depression and with bouts of anxiety, when they have increased stress in their lives, that can often be a trigger actually for a relapse, a reason for them to turn to substances in part to numb the pain that they feel.Sometimes some of the most powerful advice that you can get comes from your friends -- and that means that you are an incredibly important resource for the people in your life. And if you see people using or misusing these substances, never hesitate to have a conversation with them. If you're worried, and I know that's hard, right? And it feels like you're but doing into someone else's business or that you're being nosy, that you're not being preachy with them. But let me tell you this of the many people that I have known and cared for, who have lost loved ones over the years to opioid use overdoses. So many of them wish somebody in their loved one's life and thought to say something early on when they first noticed that there was a problem. So never doubt that that's the conversation that you have with somebody, with a friend who you see is having a hard time or misusing opioids.Dr. Murthy on the role tech platforms can play in supporting the mental health and wellbeing of young people:It's how we use [technology] that determines whether it helps us or whether it harms us. And I think that there's a lot of benefit that people can get in their lives from social platforms, the opportunity to find a community where they may not have one to share experiences in initially safer settings to find resources and help you know, and to build relationships that can all be very, very positive. But a couple of things that I do worry about one is that in order to really achieve those benefits, we have to be very thoughtful in how we design social platforms. Our goal is to help support the mental health and wellbeing of people to help them build healthy relationships. And we have to design our platforms, and then design from an engineering to a front end design perspective, in order to achieve those ends. Dr. Murthy on the ways we can change the culture around mental health: I want young people to know that you don't have to be a policymaker or run a major company, for you to be able to change a culture around mental health. You just have to have the courage to share your story. You have to have the courage to call for change, to advocate, for change. And that's what a lot of young people are doing. That's why I feel optimistic. We can change our culture on mental health and ultimately create, I think, a society and a culture that's healthier and stronger because it embraces mental and physical wellbeing."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/club-unity","date":"2021-10-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Meet Club Unity: We are here for you.","text":"In celebration of World Mental Health Awareness Day, Snap is launching Club Unity, a new board of young leaders that unites today’s leading actors, dancers, singers, and athletes to support Gen Z voices; empowering them to address the generation’s most critical topics.

Our community can also access new creative tools like Lenses, Stickers, and Bitmojis to help them easily express themselves or reach out to friends in need.As part of our inaugural year of Club Unity, we have begun a multi-year partnership with Active Minds, a mental health organization for students and young adults with a network of more than 800 campus chapters at colleges, universities, and high schools nationwide. Our partnership will support the expansion of Active Minds chapters at community colleges, HBCUs, and high-schools with the goal of reaching a larger number of BIPOC and LGBTQ+ students. In the coming weeks, Snap Inc. and Active Minds will host the first-ever Club Unity Summit with undergraduate students where all attendees will have the opportunity to become officially certified by Active Minds in Validate, Appreciate, ReferⓇ to help support friends through challenges.

Snapchat reaches 90% of 13-24 year olds in the U.S., giving us a meaningful opportunity to empower the next generation to become active and engaged citizens. Which is why today, we are announcing our newest in-app initiative to help young people run for local office.Our new Run for Office Mini is designed to help Snapchatters engage with democracy in an easy, native-to-mobile way. Powered with information from BallotReady, this simple tool will help Snapchatters explore hundreds of opportunities to run for local office based on the issues they care most about — from City Neighborhood Board and Township Council to School Board and State Representative. Starting today, any Snapchatter in the United States can easily access Run for Office by opening Snapchat, swiping down on the camera screen to access Snap’s in-app games, known as ‘Minis,’ or simply just searching ‘Run for Office’ within Snapchat. We know this next generation is the most diverse, yet currently only 6% of state legislators are under the age of 35. We hope our Run for Office initiative will help shape a more equitable, and reflective, democracy that includes all Americans, including young people.This work builds on our efforts to help make it easier for Snapchatters to engage in their democratic processes through voting. Ahead of the 2020 US election, we launched a suite of voter engagement tools with support from TurboVote and BallotReady to help Snapchatters register to vote, understand their ballot, make a plan to vote, and learn about voter protection resources. As a result, we helped more than 1.2 million Snapchatters register to vote in that election -- more than half of which were first-time voters. Our Run for Office Mini was designed to tackle common barriers that young people face when considering if they want to run for public office. It includes: A centralized portal on local elected offices that can be filtered by issue. We created a one stop resource that curates over 75,000 upcoming elections on the federal, state and local level that Snapchatters may be eligible for. Snapchatters identify a set of issues they are passionate about and then we surface roles they may be interested in. Access to experienced candidate recruitment organizations and training programs across the political spectrum. These groups will be connected directly with Snapchatters to help them with the first steps needed to start a campaign, and include: Emerge America, IGNITE, New American Leaders, New Politics, Run GenZ, Run for Something, Running Start, LGBTQ Victory Institute, Vote Run Lead, Women’s Public Leadership Network.The ability to nominate friends to run for office. Snapchatters say friends were more than five times more influential in their decision to vote in the 2020 election vs. influencers and celebrities. The Run for Office Mini allows Snapchatters to nominate their friends who they see as future leaders. A personalized campaign hub. The ‘My Campaign Dashboard’ will show Snapchatters the first steps they need to take to get on the ballot, including filing deadlines and signature requirements, as well as contact information for local election offices. In addition, Snapchatters will be able to share stickers from this portal to start campaigning on Snapchat with their closest friends. As part of this effort, and building upon our 2020 research, we are partnering with the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University’s Tisch College. Their research has shown that a new, diverse generation of young people want to lead political change, and we are working together to better understand the barriers that prevent some youth from running for office so we can create more equitable pathways to civic engagement and public service.Snapchatters are eager to get involved and make a difference in their local communities — and we’re excited to do our part to help remove the barriers that have historically kept young people from getting involved in their communities to make a difference.

We’ve used every iteration as a building block, opening the door to a whole new dimension of AR. Spectacles aren’t for sale—they’re for augmented reality creators to reimagine the way we communicate, live, and explore the world together through AR experiences built in Lens Studio. Features Spectacles tap into our human senses of sight, touch, and sound to bring Lenses to life. Dual 3D waveguide displays and a 26.3 degree field of view overlay Lenses on the world, right before your eyes. Powered by our new Snap Spatial Engine that leverages six degrees of freedom and hand, marker, and surface tracking, Spectacles realistically overlay creators’ imaginations on the world in a new way.   Lenses react quickly and appear accurately in your field of view with 15 millisecond motion to photon latency, and the display dynamically adjusts up to 2000 Nits of brightness to explore AR indoors or outside. Spectacles feature 2 RGB cameras, 4 built-in microphones, 2 stereo speakers, and a touchpad to provide a multi-sensorial experience.Spectacles weigh just 134 grams, so creators can bring AR anywhere for approximately 30 minutes per charge. The Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1 Platform unlocks the maximum processing power within Spectacles’ lightweight, wearable design. Functionality Spectacles are fully integrated with Lens Studio, our powerful desktop application designed for creators and developers to build and publish Lenses across our Snap AR platform. Through Lens Studio, creators can wirelessly push Lenses to Spectacles for rapid testing and iteration, in real time. The temple’s touchpad helps creators interact with the Spectacles display and launches the Lens Carousel. The right button activates Scan, understanding what’s in the field of view and suggesting relevant Lenses based on the world around you. Voice Scan also empowers creators to say a command to launch Lenses, completely hands-free. The left button captures 10-second Snaps of Lenses overlaid on the world, so creators can send Snaps right from Spectacles. Spectacles Creators  We’ve offered the new Spectacles to a select group of creators around the world to learn alongside us and push the boundaries of AR.

In this year’s report, we are committing to new, more ambitious goals and initiatives that will help us continue to become a more fair, inclusive, and anti-racist company. You can read the report and watch a video here: As we know, 2020 profoundly challenged the way we think and act. It made us think longer and harder about the sheer scale of the task to embed equity in business and society. It taught us that one person’s story can change the world; that empathy is critical and must be scaled; and that diversity, equity and inclusion is everyone’s job. This year’s report shares our story of changing hearts, minds, and business priorities. Our 2020 data shows a mixed story -- we made progress increasing representation in some important areas but in other areas we made smaller gains than we hoped.  To directly address the areas we need to improve the most and continue to build on the foundation we laid last year, we are setting new representation goals; redesigning our systems to build more inclusive products that work for all Snapchatters, starting with the camera at the center of our app; and rolling out comprehensive accountability mechanisms, including how we measure all team members on their contributions to our DEI goals. While we are not yet where we aspire to be, we have seen profound change across our team in so many ways. We are deeply grateful to those of you who have pushed us tirelessly in the right direction for so long.

The project also includes a set of inspirational stickers and a microsite with resources empowering Snapchatters to pursue similar career paths. The creatives also leveraged typography designed by Vocal Type inspired by key historical moments like the Memphis Sanitation Strike of 1968 and The March on Washington.In the first two days since its launch, the “Show Them Who WE A/RE” campaign reached over 12 million Snapchatters across the country.

It builds an evidence-based view of what the future looks like for young people across six markets - Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States - and includes a mix of new field research, analysis of an extensive range of data sources and expert insights from entrepreneurs and policy experts.Over the past 12 months, young people have had to navigate enormous challenges and disruptions to their education, career prospects, mental health and wellbeing. Whilst the dominant narrative has been that the future of Gen Z is likely to be full of uncertainty, the research from Oxford Economics shows there is a real case for optimism.As the first generation to have grown up with technology, Gen Z are uniquely placed to bounce back and make the most of the growing demand for digital skills. Key takeaways from the report include, by 2030:Gen Z will become a dominant force in the workplace with the number in work across the six markets trebling to 87 million by 2030They will become an engine of consumer spending with projections that they will support $3.1 trillion of spending in these markets in 2030Technology and COVID-19 are set to transform skills demand - with the majority of jobs to require advanced digital skillsA greater emphasis will be put on skills such as agility, curiosity, creativity, critical thinking and problem solving, which play to the natural strengths of Gen ZFurthermore, the study highlights the increased potential of Augmented Reality - one of the fastest growing digital technologies during the pandemic and a market expected to expand four-fold by 2023. It’s expected to grow beyond industries such as e-commerce and marketing to transform how we experience healthcare, education, architecture, entertainment and manufacturing. Jobs in the sector are becoming increasingly more popular and require a blend of technical skills and creativity that will ultimately favour Gen Z. The report also includes recommendations from Oxford Economics to businesses, educators and policymakers to help young people fully seize the opportunity of the shift to a more digital economy by closing the attainment gap in the short-term, as well as rethinking traditional models of education in the longer term."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/bitmoji-wheelchairstickers","date":"2021-02-24T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Bitmoji Wheelchair Representation for Inclusivity Project","text":"Bitmoji’s mission has always been to create avatars that reflect and represent the diversity of our community.

The architecture of our platform is designed to encourage connection and communication between those who are real friends, while making it much harder for strangers to find and friend Snapchatters. For example, on Snapchat:There are no browsable public profiles for Snapchatters under 18;By default, you cannot Chat or contact someone directly unless you have both added each other as friends;Many of our features are set to private by default, which helps protect Snapchatters from unknowingly sharing information, such as their location, with their friends; and We don’t give Group chats the opportunity to ‘go viral’ in a way that in other settings sometimes become vectors for extremist content or recruitment. Group chats are designed to be conversations among groups of real friends, so we limit their size to 64 friends. Groups aren’t searchable, recommended or surfaced anywhere else in the app outside of the Chat tab. Today, on Safer Internet Day, we’re going a step further by announcing a new feature, “Friend Check Up,” that will prompt Snapchatters to review their Friend lists and make sure it’s made up of people they still want to be connected to. This simple tooltip will be served to Snapchatters as a notification in their profile. Friend Check Up will start rolling out globally for Android devices in the coming weeks, and for iOS devices in the coming months. Friend Check Up will serve to remind Snapchatters that over time they may have added someone to their friends list who they may no longer want to be in touch with on our app. With a quick, private, convenient process, Friend Check Up enables Snapchatters to clean up their lists and comfortably remove those who don’t need to be there or may have been added as a mistake. This new feature is part of a more comprehensive campaign we kicked off last month with the goal of further integrating online safety and privacy education in Snapchat, in ways that will help resonate with our mobile-first generation. In addition to in-app tools, this initiative also spans new partnerships and resources, including several we are announcing today. To raise awareness in-app for Safer Internet Day, we are partnering with Connect Safely in the US and ChildNet in the UK on filters that will swipe up to additional safety resources from each organization. We are expanding our partnership with Crisis Text Line, who will make it even easier for Snapchatters to get support if they need it, and partnering with Shout in the UK, where we will launch a crisis text line for local Snapchatters -- similar to what we offer our community in the US. We are partnering with The Trevor Project on a series of mental health initiatives for LGBTQ youth, including new in-app resources, and partnering with Mind Up| A Goldie Hawn Foundation, on an online parent course that will offer basic tools and strategies to support their teens’ well-being. This course will complement an updated Parents Guide we recently released, which we collaborated with several of these organizations on. We hope that Snapchatters find these tools helpful. And we encourage their support systems -- parents, loved ones and educators -- to check out our new resources and talk to their kids about the importance of viewing their friend lists."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/snap-celebrates-black-history-month","date":"2021-02-03T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Snap Celebrates Black History Month","text":"As we kick off Black History Month, we’re releasing new features and tools to celebrate the vibrant culture and history of the Black community.

From the outset, Snapchat was designed to recreate the natural feeling of a conversation -- a private communication between close friends that deletes by default and isn’t preserved for eternity. Our privacy-centric approach isn’t a talking point for us -- it runs throughout our business. We put new features through an intense privacy review process to make sure they meet our standards. We handle Snapchatters’ information with the same care that we use for ourselves, our family and our friends: we don’t stockpile their private messages and Snaps and Chats delete by default. We have always viewed the privacy and safety of our community as connected. Privacy isn’t just about data protection and security -- it’s about personal protection and security too. For example, Snapchat’s privacy-focused architecture makes it harder for strangers to find and contact members of our community. Many of our features are set to private by default, which helps protect Snapchatters from unknowingly sharing information with their friends.   But beyond this, we believe we have a responsibility to help our community learn about how to protect their privacy and wellbeing when using our products. To date, we have done this through our Privacy Center, which lays out in clear terms how Snapchatters can control their information, what data we collect across each of our products and how it is used. We have also increased our in-app education efforts, such as sending a Mass Chat to Snapchatters reminding them to bolster their account security by using two-factor authentication and creating a series of animated Snaps about our privacy practices.  In 2021, we will double down on these efforts by launching a more expansive digital literacy campaign for Snapchatters. Today, as we mark Global Privacy Day, we’re rolling out “Safety Snapshot” a new safety and privacy-focused channel on our Discover Platform, produced in partnership with outside experts. Each month, this channel will provide Snapchatters with straightforward tips, starting with an episode going live today that walks Snapchatters through how to better protect their account by verifying their email and phone number. Future episodes will focus on Snapchat’s privacy settings; the importance of two-factor authentication; and how to set strong passwords to protect against phishing. In addition, we’re launching a new filter in partnership with the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF), a leading privacy organization, which includes a swipe-up link to more resources on their website, such as a student privacy communications toolkit.We will continue to expand on this initiative in the coming months, through additional in-app resources and partnerships to help demystify privacy and safety issues for Snapchatters and their loved ones. Our goal is to find innovative ways to further integrate online safety education in Snapchat, in ways that will resonate with this mobile-first generation. To check out the channel, open Snapchat and point your camera at the Snapcode below.

We built Spotlight to be a place where anyone’s content can take center stage - without needing a public account, or an influencer following. It’s a fair and fun place for Snapchatters to share their best Snaps and see perspectives from across the Snapchat community.Our Recommendations Our content algorithms work to surface the most engaging Snaps you’d be interested in. We focus on serving the right Snaps to the right person at the right time. We do this by trying to understand your personal preferences. Our ranking algorithm looks at factors that show people are interested in a particular Snap, like: the amount of time spent watching it, if it is favorited, and if it’s shared with friends. It also considers negative factors, including if the viewer skipped watching the Snap quickly. Snaps that appear in Spotlight can be from Snapchatters with private, personal accounts, or from Snap Stars with public profiles and millions of Subscribers. Surfacing New Types of Entertainment To help surface new types of content Snapchatters may be interested in, and mitigate against echo chambers, we’ve built diversity directly into the Spotlight experience. We work hard to make sure that our algorithms are developed with diverse outcomes in mind. We do that a few ways, including by building our algorithmic models using diverse training data sets, and vetting our models for biases and discrimination. We also use “exploration” mechanisms to ensure that you see new and diverse entertainment in Spotlight. This approach distributes views more fairly to a broad group of creators. And, it teaches our algorithmic models that diversity and inclusion of different views should be part of their native function.For example, if you show us in Spotlight that you really like dogs, we want to give you entertaining puppy Snaps to enjoy! But, we also want to make sure we’re surfacing other types of content, other creators, and other adjacent interest areas for you, like creators who focus on nature, videos about travel, or even just other animals.  Rewarding CreativitySpotlight is designed to reward creativity in a fair and fun way, and we’re distributing over $1 million USD every day to Snapchatters. Snapchatters must be 16 or older, and where applicable, obtain parental consent to earn. The program will run through the end of 2020, and potentially beyond. Earnings are determined by a proprietary formula which rewards Snapchatters primarily based on the total number of unique video views a Snap gets in a given day (calculated using Pacific Time) as compared to the performance of other Snaps that day. Many Snapchatters will earn each day, and the ones who create the top Snaps within that group will earn the most for their creativity. We actively monitor for fraud to ensure that we only account for authentic engagement with Snaps. Our formula may be adjusted from time to time. To appear on Spotlight, all Snaps must adhere to our Community Guidelines, which prohibit the spread of false information (including conspiracy theories), misleading content, hate speech, explicit or profane content, bullying, harassment, violence, and much more. And, Snaps submitted to Spotlight must also adhere to our Spotlight Guidelines, Terms of Service, and Spotlight Terms."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-astrology","date":"2020-11-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"See How the Stars and Your Friendships Align with Snapchat Astrology","text":"The stars have aligned!

Seventeen experts on friendship from around the world contributed to the report. Talking in pictures and videos layered with creative tools like our augmented reality Lenses, Filters, and personal avatars Bitmoji, help Snapchatters express themselves and interact visually. They serve as an essential connector when meeting face to face is not an option and at this difficult time have enabled Snapchatters to feel closer to their best friends even as non-Snapchatters feel more distant.The Friendship Report sheds new light on how COVID is affecting friendship and what other major events in life also have an impact, including:COVID has brought some friends closer together, but also made some of us feel lonely.Friends are our first line of defense against loneliness, and we generally make our best friends in childhood; on average we have known our closest friends for at least half of our lives.  Most of us have lost touch with a close friend from childhood, with the majority wanting to rediscover that close connection.While most of us are keeping connected better through digital communication channels, we still need to develop our friendship skills to help us learn how to maintain friendships over distance and get back in touch if we do lose contact.Experts from around the world have provided advice and tips on how to do this, Snap has also created a new Friendship Time Capsule to help Snapchatters celebrate their friendships.The impact of COVID-19Six months after much of the world has put in place social distancing restrictions, friends are having to find new ways to stay connected, and the long term effects are only just starting to become clear. “This is the biggest psychological experiment ever conducted, and we don’t know yet how it’s going to end.” Lydia Denworth, journalist and author.Two-thirds of friends say they are using online channels to communicate more than they would have before COVID-19 (66%) and for many those conversations have been deeper (49%), rather than focusing on surface-level topics. It appears digital communications are key to staying in touch when we’re apart, with a vast majority (79%) saying that they have helped friends maintain their relationship, regardless of age.Even though there’s been an uptick in outreach to friends, COVID-19 has also led to loneliness for some. Two-thirds of those we surveyed said they’ve felt lonely since the pandemic started (66%) - 8% higher than pre-COVID-19.Almost half of people (49%) say that being unable to see their friends has made them feel lonelier, with only a third feeling friends are reaching out to them as much as they would like (30%). In fact, a third of people (31%) felt that social distancing has weakened their relationships with friends.In total, a third of people we surveyed said that COVID-19 has affected their friendships. With just over half saying that it has led to them not feeling as close to their friends (53%). And nearly half of those surveyed agreed with the statement that they “felt more distant from friends because they couldn’t spend time in-person” (45%).Laavanya Kathiravelu, who studies friendship and migration, tells us that “although friendships continue to be maintained through apps, phone calls, and other mediated forms of communication, the disembodied element takes away from the full experience of friendship for many.”This may explain why there was a marked difference between Snapchatters who often communicate visually - and non-Snapchatters - with Snapchatters becoming closer to friends during the pandemic. Friendship researcher Donya Alinejad describes the importance of visual communication as creating “co-presence” which results in “a feeling of being together when you’re actually physically distant.” Feeling as though we’re actually together is important “for a whole host of reasons,” Alinejad says, particularly “for those who are in need of or require a kind of emotional support.”The upside is that, with the pandemic causing so much isolation, people genuinely want to reach out and check in on those they care about.Over a third of people (39%) say their friendships are more important to them now and nearly half of us are making an intentional choice to reach out to friends that they haven’t spoken to in a while (48%).The lockdown has [had] a kind of funneling effect. You reinforce specific ties and you set others apart. So, it really has strengthened some relationships during this period,” noted Guillaume Favre, sociologist.The one that got away and reconnectionLast year, Snap’s Friendship Report found that friendships, especially those from childhood, have a huge impact on happiness and wellbeing. So, it was surprising to see this year that 79% of us globally have lost touch with a close friend but heartening that 66% say they would like to rekindle their relationship. In the US, those numbers are higher, at 88% and 71% respectively.And we would generally respond positively to one of our best friends re-establishing contact, with the most prominent emotions being delighted (36%), or excited (29%), whereas a minority would feel awkward (14%), or suspicious (6%).How do we find our way back to close friends? Well over two thirds of people (67%) would prefer reconnecting digitally, but only around half of people would know how to (54%). The number one thing people would like to send to their friends, would be a photo of them together (42%), with the number two being a photo that reminded them of a shared memory (40%). Humor also ranks highly, with a third thinking that sending a funny meme or GIF would be the best way to start a conversation (31%). Over a third (35%) would like tools to use to help communicate, especially in tough situations like getting back in touch.How to be a better friendThere are plenty of resources for people struggling with relationships like family or marriage, but friendship hasn’t received the same treatment. This has left many without the tools or confidence they need to develop and navigate the ups and downs of friendships. British lecturer Gillian Sandstrom, who studies social psychology, talks about the “liking gap,” where we are prone to think people like us less than they actually do. This bias breeds insecurity about engaging in conversations. We fear awkward pauses and failed connections so much that foregoing the opportunity to start a friendship or deepen a relationship can be the safer choice. People are more likely to like you than you think, so go ahead and be brave.Listening, staying present, and accepting responsibility are key friendship skills. Honing these skills can take a little work, but with some lessons and practice, our experts agree we can improve our friendships."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/celebrating-snap-in-india-2020","date":"2020-10-20T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Celebrating Snap in India","text":"This week, we hosted a virtual event to celebrate our growing community of Snapchatters in India and the strong partnerships we’ve built.We have always believed that Snapchat should feel culturally relevant, no matter where you are in the world.

We found that a majority of Snapchatters experience feelings of stress and anxiety, and that their friends are the first people they turn to when they need help, more than professionals or even their parents. We wanted to give them new preventative wellbeing tools to use directly with their friends, in the same place they’re already communicating many times a day.Now, many months into the COVID-19 pandemic, and with Snapchatters navigating the start of a school year virtually or continuing to work from home, we wanted to get a better sense of how the crisis is impacting them. We commissioned a survey by GroupSolver to learn about how young people are experiencing stress and uncertainty across the US, UK and France. In each of those markets, the results show most Snapchatters are feeling increasingly stressed, with COVID-19 being a primary driver:    Snapchatters are feeling more stressed than last year and feeling stressed more frequently -- with 73% of Snapchatters in the US saying they’ve felt stressed in the last week, followed by 68% in the UK and 60% in France.COVID-19 is a leading cause of stress (85% of US Snapchatters, with 87% in the UK and 80% in France), followed by finances (81% in US, 77% in UK and 76% in France) and work/career pressures (80% in US and 77% in the UK and France). The election/politics are also a significant source of stress for US Snapchatters -- with 60% citing it as contributing to their stress levels.For Gen Z Snapchatters in the US (13-24), school is a leading source of stress (75% for 13-24 and 91% for 13-17), with lack of socialization with their peers, and falling behind on their education due to COVID-19 disruptions cited as major concerns. US Snapchatters report this stress as taking a toll on their emotional and physical well being -- with 60% reporting feeling anxious, 60% feeling exhausted and 59% feeling overwhelmed. Close to 50% report feeling restlessness and 43% are experiencing increased headaches.Taking into account that approximately one-third of Snapchatters in the US and one-fifth of users in the UK and France use meditation to cope with stress, we’re rolling out new Headspace guided meditations to directly address some of these issues including:“Choose Kindness” - a mini meditation focused on practicing kindness which can change how we show up in the world and how we treat others. In the midst of chaos, confusion and conflict, this meditation is designed to shift our mindset and move to a place of compassion.“Take on the School Year” - a mini meditation focused on navigating uncertainty at school. Whether students are back in the classroom or still at home, there might be feelings of worry, anxiety or even disconnection from friends. This meditation is designed to help you connect with your breath and find a resting place to ease uncertainty.We believe that Snapchat can play an important role in supporting the health and happiness of our community. In addition to our mental health resources like Here For You, we look forward to building these efforts and continuing to empower Snapchatters to seek out support and connect with friends."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/city-painter","date":"2020-10-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Bringing City Painter to Carnaby Street, London","text":"Today, augmented reality is changing how we talk with our friends. There are over one million lenses on Snapchat, and more than 75% of our Daily Active Users interact with AR every day. But, we imagine a future where we’ll use AR to see the world in completely new ways. Last year we introduced Landmarkers, which enabled the Snapchat Camera to understand individual buildings and allowed Lenses to interact with some of the world’s greatest landmarks. From Buckingham Palace, to the Flatiron Building in New York, to the Taj Mahal, these places came to life in entirely new ways from the perspectives of the world’s most creative people, closely weaving our physical and the digital world together. Today we’re taking the next step with Local Lenses, which evolves this technology and makes it possible to augment larger areas, including city blocks. By taking in information from 360-degree images, and Community Snaps, we’re able to build up a digital representation of the physical world, and view an augmented experience from different viewpoints. Combining this with 3D reconstruction, machine learning and distributed cloud compute, we can now map whole city blocks. This week, you can find our first Local Lens on Carnaby Street in London, called City Painter. Snapchatters can join a persistent, shared AR world built right on top of the physical one, and collaborate to paint the space around them.

Our camera opens up without any Lenses or Filters, and there are lots of ways to make Snaps more expressive by using our creative tools to change up your world view or the way you look. Through transparent design, Snapchatters are empowered to express themselves in their own unique way.We’re collaborating with Google on a new set of best practices to bring even more transparency around facial retouching on our platform. This supports the philosophy we’ve always had -- our community should have complete control over changes made to their appearance in Snaps. We also believe that language is important. Lens Studio already uses value neutral terms for its facial retouching feature. We use words like “Retouching” instead of “Beautification” to give Lens Creators the space to interpret how their Lenses look and make people feel. We are committed to continuing to make improvements in this area and across Snapchat. This is just one step in our ongoing effort to better support Snapchatters. We look forward to building on this and developing more ways to support a transparent relationship with technology and our community."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/bitmoji-jordan","date":"2020-09-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Love Jordans?

But for all the speculation about whether or not Gen Z will go to the polls or who they might vote for, there hasn’t been much of an effort to understand the barriers that keep them from voting, the issues that matter most to them, and how best to reach this influential generation. This summer, we set out to unpack that, by partnering with Tufts’ University’s Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), Morning Consult, and Crowd DNA on new quantitative and qualitative research among bipartisan Gen Z voters and experts on youth civic engagement. Today we’re publishing our findings, which reveal that we should expect Gen Z -- many of whom will be eligible to vote in their first presidential election this year -- to show up to vote like never before in 2020.Among our findings:The pandemic is hitting home: 82% percent of Gen Zers say the COVID-19 pandemic has made them realize how political leaders’ decisions impact their everyday lives. Activism leads to voting: Young people who identify themselves as both conservative and liberal consider themselves activists -- and recent studies show that activism makes them more likely to vote. College is a primary resource for voter engagement: 63% of students aged 18-21 typically learn about civic processes while attending college -- whether from voter registration drives happening on campus or fellow students. Our systems leave out huge numbers of young voters: Only 33% of 18-23 year olds are able to attend college full-time, which means there is a huge population of eligible young voters who historically have not had as much access to information and resources that will help them vote. In short, our existing voting processes haven’t been modernized for a mobile-first generation and the way they communicate and consume information. But our research shows they are poised to overcome this barrier in 2020. Mobile civic tools can play a pivotal role for young people in this election by providing resources to educate young voters, help them register, provide a sample ballot, and ensure they understand their voting options -- whether by mail or in person.Given the pandemic’s impact on college campuses -- and the number of young people who aren’t traditional full-time students -- digital tools can serve as an equalizer in providing civic and political information to young Americans across the country.We hope this research is helpful for those working to connect with Gen Z ahead of this election -- and in elections going forward -- and ultimately to help them achieve the representation they deserve. 2020 might be the year that we see historic youth voter turnout, and we encourage you to check out our full white paper."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/mark-bradford-voter-reg","date":"2020-09-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Renowned Artist Mark Bradford Teams with Snap for Voter Registration","text":"Today marks National Voter Registration Day -- a massive nationwide and nonpartisan effort to register voters well in advance of Election Day this November. At Snap, we’ve always believed that one of the most powerful forms of self-expression is exercising the right to vote and participating in our democracy.Every day on our app, we see the Snapchat Generation show incredible passion, creativity, and innovation that’s helping make the world a better place. We want to do everything we can to remove the barriers that have historically kept younger voters from showing up to vote, and empower future generations to speak out and make their voices heard.That’s why earlier this month, we launched new mobile tools that will help first-time and young voters register to vote directly in our app, learn about their voting options and the issues and candidates on their ballot, and make a plan to vote. Across all of these tools, Snapchat is focused on empowering users to do the kind of 1:1 outreach with their friends that they might traditionally do on college campuses, making calls or knocking on doors. Today we’re proud to partner with renowned artist Mark Bradford on a new augmented reality Lens to encourage our community to register to vote. We reach more 13-24 year olds in the US than Facebook, Instagram and Messenger combined -- and a majority are of voting age. In fact, of the 100 million Snapchatters in the U.S., 80% are 18+. This new lens applies the artist’s signature abstract painting style to a face mask emblazoned with the word “Vote,” and features a button that takes Snapchatters directly to our voter registration tool. This goal of translating ideas into action through abstract painting, which Bradford’s practice combines with social engagement elements, has been a consistent focus for the artist since the early 2000s. Over the course of his career, Bradford’s work has elevated critical social themes, including racial justice and equity, women’s rights and police brutality -- and we’re incredibly honored that he is bringing his powerful talent to Snapchat. Our community has already shown great enthusiasm for our new voter registration tools -- as of Monday, Snapchat has helped more than 750,000 register to vote through the app in 2020. Snap has a strong record when it comes to voter registration -- in the 2018 midterms, the company helped well over 400,000 Snapchatters register to vote and 57% of them actually voted. To help them turn out this cycle, Snapchat will remind users who have registered about key voting deadlines in their states; messages reminding users to make a plan to vote; a voter checklist available in their user profile, and resources from civic partners in their Voter Guide."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/bosco-specs","date":"2020-09-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Bosco Debuts the “4th of July” Music Video, Shot on Spectacles 3","text":"Today Snap and musical artist Bosco debuted Bosco’s “4th of July” music video, one of the first music videos shot entirely on Spectacles. For this project, Bosco took on the role of co-creative director, putting Spectacles on real-life artistic couple MELO-X and Corey Wash to shoot and star in the video, capturing the emotions of the song.

This report, which also details our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and related data, reflects our belief that it is in Snap’s best interest to contribute to creating a society that is healthy and an environment that is clean and safe, so that our business is able to reach its full potential. We want to profit as a byproduct of the success of our team, community, and partners – not at their expense.This means that we define our success in terms of our relationships and the way we treat our team, our community, and our partners. We strive to build win-win-win partnerships where all parties benefit from shared success. Corporate citizenship is not an accessory to our business, it reflects the way we do business.We are headquartered in the United States, a country with a unique history of corporate personhood, with equal protection guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to its Constitution (ratified during Reconstruction following the Civil War). The US government and courts have made clear that businesses participate in society not simply as profit-maximizing machines, but rather as fellow citizens – with accompanying rights and responsibilities. Our responsibilities extend beyond basic compliance with the laws of the countries where we operate to also include a commitment to making a positive difference.In the US, we have learned that we cannot move forward without acknowledging our past and recognizing that we are here today at the expense of other people. The wealth of our nation was built on stolen land and stolen labor: enslaved people laid the economic foundation for our national prosperity, as did the forcible taking of expansive lands from indigenous people. Our headquarters in Los Angeles sits on land originally belonging to the Chumash and Tongva.To understand that African American families hold roughly one-tenth the wealth of white American families on average is, necessarily, an indictment of our behavior. As is the fact that Native Americans had a poverty rate in 2018 more than two-and-a-half times higher than that of white Americans. These facts do not reflect the values that we seek to realize.It is clear that we have a choice: allow these inequities to be perpetuated in the United States – or do our part to better fulfill the shared values we seek to uphold as a society. It would be misleading to suggest that even our most strenuous efforts as a business are capable of creating broad societal change, given the massive and ongoing structural inequities and policies in the United States that invest unevenly in our citizens, but we will not stand idly by and do nothing. We cannot do it alone, but we will do our part.We will use our voice, our corporate personhood, to advocate for the investments we must make in the future of our country – to alleviate poverty, provide educational opportunity, build the necessary digital infrastructure, and confront our history of injustice. These efforts begin inside our business, with the things that we can most directly impact, like our pay practices, hiring and inclusion programs, tax strategy, supply chain, and energy consumption. We want to ensure that all members of our team, our community, and our partners feel understood and appreciated – celebrated – for who they are: each person equal in their differences.Please consider our first CitizenSnap report a “rough draft”, an explanation of how we are going about these efforts, and reflective of our desire to learn, grow, and iterate. There is no doubt that today we fall short of our aspirations. We have an overwhelming amount of work to do, and our team feels strongly that it is important to hold ourselves accountable publicly. We believe that the greatest long-term limitation on the growth of Snap is the success of our broader society, and we will invest accordingly.Evan"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/pride-ar","date":"2020-06-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Pride Marches on in Augmented Reality","text":"Snap and Pride Media have teamed up to ensure the spirit of Pride, deeply rooted in activism, marches on. The partnership brings the iconic publisher of LGBTQ outlets The Advocate and Out together with Snapchat for the first time to spotlight diverse, queer-identifying changemakers advancing equity for all people in every U.S. state, with the help of Snap’s augmented reality capabilities and creator community.The immersive AR experiences launch today alongside The Advocate’s 2020 edition of the annual “Champions of Pride” feature, highlighting the work of activists, artists, elected officials and everyday people representing a full spectrum of LGBTQ+ and BIPOC communities who are affecting real change. Snapchatters can explore virtual art gallery spaces, where they can learn about each “Champion of Pride”, including: “Mighty” Rebekah, a 13 year-old who’s successfully lobbied her home state of New Jersey to greenlight an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculumKim Jackson, a Black Episcopal priest who is running to become Georgia’s first out State SenatorKarla Bautisa, a trans indigenous woman from Arizona who organizes to free LGBTQ immigrants from detentionTo bring advocacy to life through augmented reality, Snap has tapped several Official Lens Creators to build a series of five portal Lenses that each represent a region of the U.S., letting Snapchatters celebrate the stories of each “Champion of Pride.” Each Lens showcases the creator’s unique vision and the distinct flavor of the region, such as a brick-walled gallery space in the North Atlantic Lens and state flowers and cattail plants in Cyrene’s South Lens.

We’re now significantly improving that experience, by immediately showing Snapchatters how they can get connected with emergency services, message a trained counselor through Crisis Text Line, or talk live with someone at the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. We look forward to building on these efforts and developing more ways to empower friends to help friends."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/noface-chillah","date":"2020-06-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"NoFace Chillah","text":"There is no one face to Snapchat.

I witnessed the devastation of Apartheid and the legacy of racism, but also the tireless efforts towards progress and reconciliation. At Stanford, I lived in Ujamaa my Senior year, a dorm on campus that is dedicated to the black community (and in which the majority of residents are black). Even amidst the tremendous privilege at Stanford, there was plenty to learn about the everyday injustices of racism in our society.I share this not to suggest any first-hand understanding of the black lived experience in the United States but rather to explain that for nearly 30 years I have personally witnessed or participated in the passionate and persistent, well-reasoned, and forceful appeal for justice in America and around the world. 30 years later, despite a chorus of millions calling for change, there is little to show in the way of progress. Economic inequality in America has reached levels unseen for nearly a century, people of color cannot visit a grocery store or go for a jog without fear of being murdered without consequence, and put simply, the American experiment is failing.I share this because I understand that, in the words of MLK, “riots are the language of the unheard” and those that have been peacefully advocating for change for centuries have seen little, if any, progress towards the vision of freedom, equality, and justice for all that America has long promised. I understand why those who are rioting have felt unheard.At the first speech I was invited to give after we created Snapchat, delivered at the Stanford Women in Business Conference in 2013, I declared that “I am a young, white, educated male. I got really, really lucky. And life isn’t fair.” I felt it was deeply important to name my privilege and acknowledge injustice in our society – especially in front of women business leaders who cope with these injustices daily. Acknowledging my privilege was an important first step for me because it helped me to listen. My experiences as a wealthy, white male are categorically different than the injustices experienced by our fellow Americans. Understanding the plight of those who are different than me has helped me become a better ally in the struggle.The fundamental idea behind the creation of our country was the notion that the circumstances of your birth did not preordain the trajectory of your life. Our founders thought the idea that God chose one king was ridiculous – God chose all of us and loves all of us equally. They desired to build a society that reflected the love of God and the idea that God dwells in all of us. God doesn’t believe that any of us are more or less deserving of love.Of course, the same Founding Fathers who espoused the values of freedom, equality, and justice for all – were predominantly slave owners. Their powerful vision of a nation created by the people, for the people was built on a foundation of prejudice, injustice, and racism. Without addressing this rotten foundation and its ongoing failures to create opportunity for all, we are holding ourselves back from realizing our true capacity for human progress – and we will continue to fall short of the bold vision of freedom, equality, and justice for all.Often I am asked by friends, team members, journalists, and partners what we can do to make a difference. Recognizing that I am in no way an expert, and at the ripe old age of 29 I have much to learn about the workings of the world, below I will share my own perspective on what is needed to create the change we crave in America. We cannot end systemic racism without simultaneously creating opportunity for all people, regardless of their background.I believe the first and most important step is to reaffirm our commitment to our founding values as a nation: freedom, equality, justice, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We must work together to create a shared vision for future success and define what we want America to look like for our children’s children. This must be a process that involves all Americans and is “by the people, for the people.” If we can define the nation we wish to become, we can begin to take action and apply our values to the vital decisions that must be made in order to make our shared vision a reality.We will also have to begin defining our success in terms of the fulfillment of our values, rather than silly short-term metrics like GDP or the stock market. When your health care costs increase, regardless of the value you receive, GDP increases. If a hurricane hits and knocks down a ton of houses so that we have to rebuild them, GDP increases. GDP is a fundamentally broken metric that does not reflect what contributes to real human happiness. The pursuit of happiness must expand beyond the pursuit of wealth.We should establish a diverse, non-partisan Commission on Truth, Reconciliation, and Reparations. We must begin a process to ensure that America’s black community is heard throughout the country, investigate the criminal justice system for bias and prejudice, strengthen the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, and take action on recommendations for reconciliation and reparations made by the Commission. There is plenty to learn from those who have had the courage to undertake a similar process following atrocities around the world, and we should create a process that reflects American values and helps our nation to make the necessary change and heal.We must restart the “Opportunity Engine” in America by investing in education, healthcare, and housing to make these basic ingredients of a free and fair society more accessible and affordable for all people.I believe that one reason entrepreneurship in America has declined so substantially since the 1980s is the lack of a sufficient societal safety net. Entrepreneurship depends on people being able to take risks to start a business, which is nearly impossible to do without some sort of safety net like the one I had. Today’s would-be entrepreneurs are saddled with student debt and are subject to stagnant wage growth and rising expenses that make it hard to save the seed capital necessary to start a business.Investing in the future of our country to benefit our children’s children will be expensive. We will need to institute a more progressive income tax system and a substantially higher estate tax, and we will need corporations to pay a higher tax rate. While we are investing in the future, we will also have to reduce the federal deficit so that we are better prepared to meet any external shocks that may come in the future in our rapidly changing world. In short, people like me will pay a lot more in taxes – and I believe it will be worth it to create a society that benefits all of us.Many of these changes could be “bad” for business in the short term, but because they represent long term investments in the people of our nation, I believe that we will collectively reap tremendous long-term benefits.Why hasn’t this change happened yet? I’d argue it’s simply because the Boomer supermajority across all branches of our government has demonstrated little interest in creating a better future for their children. For decades our government has committed to a strategy of debt-financed tax cuts and entitlement spending to enrich their most important constituents: the Boomers. Indeed, Boomers hold nearly 60% of all household wealth in America. To put it in context, billionaires hold about 3%. With Social Security, for example, we finance a program that pays out benefits across the wealthiest generation in American history without any form of means-testing.Some research has shown that when an older generation does not see themselves reflected in the younger generation, they are less willing to invest in their future. In America, the Boomer generation is about 70% white, and Gen Z is about 50% white. America’s demographic change is inevitable. The question, therefore, is whether or not we can work together to create a nation that better reflects our founding values, heals the deep wounds of our past, strives to eliminate racism and injustice, and creates opportunity for all – no matter who they are, or where they were born.Source: https://money.cnn.com/interactive/economy/diversity-millennials-boomers/As for Snapchat, we simply cannot promote accounts in America that are linked to people who incite racial violence, whether they do so on or off our platform. Our Discover content platform is a curated platform, where we decide what we promote. We have spoken time and again about working hard to make a positive impact, and we will walk the talk with the content we promote on Snapchat. We may continue to allow divisive people to maintain an account on Snapchat, as long as the content that is published on Snapchat is consistent with our community guidelines, but we will not promote that account or content in any way.It is never too late to turn towards love, and it is my sincere and earnest hope that the leadership of our great country will work towards our founding values, our raison d’être: freedom, equality, and justice for all.Until that day, we will make it clear with our actions that there is no grey area when it comes to racism, violence, and injustice – and we will not promote it, nor those who support it, on our platform.This does not mean that we will remove content that people disagree with, or accounts that are insensitive to some people. There are plenty of debates to be had about the future of our country and the world. But there is simply no room for debate in our country about the value of human life and the importance of a constant struggle for freedom, equality, and justice. We are standing with all those who stand for peace, love, and justice and we will use our platform to promote good rather than evil.I know there are many people who feel that just because “some people” are racist, or just because there is “some injustice” in our society that we are “not all bad.” It is my view that humanity is deeply interconnected and that when one of us suffers, we all suffer. When one of us is hungry, we are all hungry. And when one of us is poor, we are all poor. When any one of us enables injustice through our silence we have all failed to create a nation that strives for its highest ideals.Some of you have asked about whether Snap will contribute to organizations that support equality and justice. The answer is yes. But in my experience, philanthropy is simply unable to make more than a dent in the grave injustices we face. While our family has and will continue to contribute meaningfully to create opportunity for the underprivileged, and donate to the guardians of justice, these circumstances call for a more radical reorganization of our society. Private philanthropy can patch holes, or accelerate progress, but it alone cannot cross the deep and wide chasm of injustice. We must cross that chasm together as a united nation. United in the striving for freedom, equality, and justice for all.We have a great many challenges in front of us. To confront the long legacy of violence and injustice in America – of which George, Ahmaud, and Breonna are the latest victims, with so many more unnamed – we must embrace profound change. Not merely a change in our country, but a change in our hearts. We must carry the light of peace and share the embrace of love with all humankind.May peace be with you,Evan"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/new-spin-with-damien-hirst","date":"2020-05-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"A new spin on painting with Damien Hirst","text":"Today, we’re launching a new augmented reality experience created in close collaboration with renowned artist Damien Hirst.

Over the past year, the time spent watching Shows has more than tripled and the total daily time spent by Snapchatters watching Discover increased by over 60 percent, while the number of daily viewers has grown by 35 percent. In the U.S., Snapchat reaches 90 percent of all 13-24 year-olds and 75 percent of all 13-34 year-olds.

We wanted to create a way for our friends to express themselves and share however they felt in the moment.Today, we're launching a celebration of the real friends who use Snapchat. Featuring more than 70 Snapchatters from 12 different countries, \"Real friends\" shares the stories behind real friendships around the world.We hope you enjoy hearing their stories as much as we have!Happy Snapping!"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/friendship-report-2019","date":"2019-06-24T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Celebrating Friendship with the Friendship Report","text":"Today, we released a global study of 10,000 people across Australia, France, Germany, India, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, U.K., and the U.S. to explore how culture, age, and technology shape preferences and attitudes around friendship. Ten experts on friendship from around the world contributed to the report to contextualize the data.“Snapchat was designed from the outset as a platform to enable self-expression and deeper relationships with your real friends, which has driven our interest in the complexities around friendship and differences across cultures,” said Amy Moussavi, Snap Inc. head of consumer insights. “While friendship looks very different across the world, we know it plays a central role in our happiness and we remain deeply committed to finding new ways to celebrate and elevate it through Snapchat.\"Across all markets surveyed, people’s average social circle consists of 4.3 best friends, 7.2 good friends, and 20.4 acquaintances. Globally, most people meet their life-long best friend at the average age of 21. Respondents noted that “honesty” and “authenticity” are the most important qualities of a best friend and “having a large social network to tap into” is of least importance when making friends.The Friendship Report sheds new light on the nature of friendship, including:How different cultures interpretation of friendship impacts friendship circles and values.How friendship is linked to happiness, but that the nuances of what we share and how we feel when we talk to friends can vary substantially based on our circle size, gender, generation, and more.The generation we’re born into heavily influences our attitudes towards friendship—and that Gen Z is adjusting their approach away from the millennial desire for widespread networks in favor of the closeness and intimacy of a smaller group.“The big thing that differentiates friendships from other relationships is the fact that they’re voluntary,” said Miriam Kirmayer, therapist and friendship researcher. “Unlike relationships with our family, partners, and children, there is no outright expectation with our friends that we have to stay involved in each other’s lives. We continuously need to choose to invest in our friendships—to remain involved and to show up. It’s an ongoing implicit choice that makes our friendships so hugely impactful for our sense of happiness and self-esteem.”A sampling of insights gained from this global survey include:Cultural ImpactIn India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, people report having three times the number of best friends than those in European countries, the U.S., and Australia. Saudi Arabia has the highest average number of best friends at 6.6, whereas the U.K. has the lowest at 2.6. People in the U.S. have the second lowest average number at 3.1 best friends, and are more likely than any other country to report having only one best friend.Having friends who are “intelligent and cultured” is more valued by those in India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, whereas being “non-judgmental” matters more to those in the U.S., Europe, and Australia.Those in India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia are four times more likely than other regions to say that a “large social network” is an essential quality to have in a best friend. In fact, on average globally, “having a large social network” is the least important quality people seek out in a best friend.Friendship Circles and CommunicationGlobally, 88% of people enjoy talking to their friends online. Our respondents were able to select multiple options to explain what they enjoy about online communication, and there is agreement about the benefits. Across all regions, 32% of people chose the ability to “talk to their friends faster and more easily” as their favored explanation.Interacting with friends, whether in person or online, leaves us feeling overwhelmingly positive emotions: “happy,” “loved,” and “supported” are the three most reported globally. However, women are more likely to report feeling these emotions than men following online conversations.We see that when it comes to the average number of types of friends, users of more public platforms have larger groups of connections, but less true friends than those who prefer private communication platforms. Snapchat users have the highest number of “best friends” and “close friends,” and the fewest number of “acquaintances,” while Facebook users have the fewest number of “best friends;” and Instagram users have the highest number of “acquaintances.”Generational InfluencesGlobally, Gen Z and millennials are unsurprisingly emphatic in their love for talking with friends online—only 7% and 6% respectively said they don’t enjoy it, compared with 13% of Gen X and 26% of baby boomers. Younger generations also see value in visual communication—61% believe that video and photos help them to express what they want to say in a way that they can’t with words.Throughout the research, millennials globally come out on top as the most “share happy\" of the generations. Millennials are the least likely to say “I wouldn’t share that” across all categories surveyed. Millennials will also share issues publicly via platforms like Instagram or Facebook more than any other generation. Furthermore, they are more likely to want a best friend who has an extensive social network. Millennials are also more likely to want “as many friends as possible” than any other generation.Gen Z doesn’t appear to following in millennials’ footprints, rather they are seeking intimacy in their friendships, and craving open and honest relationships more than any other generation.Boomers are the most conservative with regards to the topics they discuss with their best friends, contrasted again by millennials. More than one-third of boomers say they wouldn’t talk about their love life (45%), mental health (40%), or money concerns (39%) with their best friend. Only 16%, 21%, and 23% of millennials wouldn’t talk to their best friends about these same topics, respectively.To read the full Snap Global Friendship Report, click here.About the ReportThe Friendship Report, commissioned in partnership with Protein Agency, polled 10,000 nationally representative people ages 13 to 75 in Australia, France, Germany, India, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the U.K. and the U.S. In the U.S. 2,004 respondents participated in the survey in the month of April 2019. Respondents were a random sampling of consumers and not chosen for their use of Snapchat; they were broken into four main generational groups, Gen Z, millennials, Gen X and baby boomers, and were surveyed on their thoughts on friendship. The Friendship Report unlocks new findings around how friends interact across the globe and generations, while also highlighting the impact of technology on our lives."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/to-android-love-snapchat","date":"2019-04-22T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"To Android.

For us, that’s about the freedom to be you — regardless of who you are, who you’ve been, or who you’re going to be.This is why we introduced the idea of ephemeral media with Snapchat — to set the assumption, just like in real life, that you’re not always on the record. This enables privacy and freedom of expression. When you meet someone new, you shouldn’t have to worry about them sifting through and analyzing a personal record of the past five years of your life.Privacy and your right to choose what information you share is at the heart of everything we do. And that’s why it came naturally for Snap to embrace the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): data minimization, short retention periods, anonymization, and security.For example, before we even begin building a new Snapchat feature, a dedicated team of privacy lawyers and engineers work closely with our designers to outline the following:How long we retain dataHow Snapchatters can view, access, and exercise rights to their dataHow to minimize the data collectedHow to ensure the data collected isn’t used for anything other than what it’s intended forWhen we do collect information, we try to be thoughtful about the kind of data we use. For example, we don’t collect information about your ethnicity, sexuality, or political allegiance and we don’t share personally-identifiable information about you with advertisers or third parties.Some of the information we will collect includes things like where you open Snapchat and what you watch in Discover. This helps us provide you with location-specific experiences, as well as assign you to “Lifestyle Categories” or “Content Interest Tags.” These interest categories help us and our advertisers provide you content that’s personalized for you.Most importantly, we want you to have control over the information you provide us. You have full control over interest categories you’ve been placed in — all of which you can choose to opt out of. If you don’t want us to use your location data, you can turn off your location permissions. Lastly, you’re free to opt out of all ads targeting based on first and third-party audience data and activity outside of our services. You can find all of these permissions in Snapchat settings.When it comes to fully understanding how your data is being used, we know that one blog post is never going to cover it. So, we’ve recently updated our Privacy Center to give you a comprehensive explanation, in language that we hope is simple and easy to understand. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us at this link here.Happy Snapping!"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/spectacles-for-summer","date":"2018-04-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"New Spectacles.

While blurring the lines between professional content creators and your friends has been an interesting Internet experiment, it has also produced some strange side-effects (like fake news) and made us feel like we have to perform for our friends rather than just express ourselves.The new Snapchat separates the social from the media. This means that the Chats and Stories from your friends are on the left side of Snapchat, and the Stories from publishers, creators, and the community are on the right.We’ve also invented something new to make Snapchat feel even more personal: the dynamic Friends page. The new Friends page to the left of the camera displays your friends based on the way you communicate with them.You can think of it as a more sophisticated Best Friends algorithm that makes it easier to find the friends you want to talk to, when you want to talk to them. We’ve all had the frustrating experience of scrolling endlessly through our Chats to find the right person - now your Friends will be listed in the order that you want to talk to them. It might take a little while for the Friends page to learn the best way to display your Friends, but the results are worth it!The new Discover page to the right of the camera includes Stories from publishers, creators, and the community. Your subscriptions live at the top, followed by other Stories you might be interested in watching. Over time, Discover will become uniquely personalized for you. While the Stories on Discover are personalized algorithmically, our curators review and approve everything that gets promoted on the page. We believe that this balance of human review and machine personalization provides the best content experience on mobile.And, as always, Snapchat opens to the Camera, making it the fastest way to share a moment with friends.Separating social from media has allowed us to build the best way to communicate with friends and the best way to watch great content - while addressing many of the problems that plague the Internet today.We hope you enjoy these changes as much as we do - it’s a whole new Snapchat!Happy Snapping!"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-context-cards","date":"2017-10-09T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Introducing Context Cards","text":"Today we’re announcing a new way to learn more about what you see on Snapchat.Inspired by something in a Snap?

We won’t backup any photos or videos from your Camera Roll, unless you use one to make a new Story or add it to My Eyes Only.

You can start by sending a few chats, and when your friend shows up, start talking or video chatting instantly with one tap. Your friend can simply listen if you want to sing them a song, or watch if you have a new puppy to show them. If they aren’t there, you can quickly send an audio note to say what you mean. And sometimes, a sticker says it best :)What we love most about the new Chat is how easily you can transition between all these ways of communicating — just like you do in person. When that’s possible, you aren’t texting, calling, or video chatting… you’re just talking. We’ve been working on this redesign for a while — we can’t wait to hear what you think!We’re also introducing Auto-Advance Stories, the fastest way to catch up with your friends.

We take the security and privacy of all that self expression seriously. That’s why we’ve filed a legal brief today supporting Apple in its dispute with the FBI.At the heart of this dispute is a locked iPhone linked to Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the terrorists behind the San Bernardino terror attack. The FBI cannot unlock the iPhone without engineering assistance from Apple, so it got a court order telling Apple to write new iOS code to create a “backdoor” into the phone.That means a single federal judge has conscripted Apple’s engineers into hacking its own software. Never before has the government asserted—let alone been granted—such a sweeping power to dictate how private companies must design (or dismantle) their own products.But the concerns here go far beyond any one company’s freedom to engineer its products. The real danger with this ruling is the threat it poses to the security of your information and communications. Here at Snapchat, people trust us to send their content in a way that helps them feel free to be themselves. If a court were to suddenly demand that we re-engineer our products to preserve every Snap that’s ever sent, our service wouldn’t be the same. That’s why we’re standing with Apple.We want to make very clear that we condemn the unspeakable evil committed in San Bernardino, and extend our bottomless sympathies to the victims and their families. Snapchat has zero regard for terrorists or any other criminals. And we prove it by cooperating with law enforcement when we get lawful requests for assistance. In the first six months of 2015 alone, we processed more than 750 subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and other legal requests. You can find all the details in our transparency report.But there’s a big difference between giving the government information we have and being forced to redesign our products to allow access that no one currently has. If one judge can force Apple to create a backdoor into its phone, another judge could make us breach our data protections too.There’s something else that really bothers us about this ruling. The only basis the government could come up with for this expansive new power was a statute that was passed in 1789. That’s not a typo. A law written more than 220 years ago by the very first Congress—a body of legislators that could scarcely imagine phones, much less smart phones—is the one and only justification for the government’s bold bid to circumvent the democratic process.There’s an important conversation that we as a nation need to have about how to balance the undeniably important interests in national security with the equally important interests in preserving the privacy and security of personal information. We welcome that conversation. But it’s one that should take place as these things usually do: through democratic exchanges before Congress. Allowing a single judge to impose radical new mandates on tech companies is not the right way to resolve these important debates.It’s time for lawmakers, businesses, and consumers to have an honest conversation about whether the government should be able to tell businesses how they should design their products.Evan Spiegel"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/on-demand-geofilters","date":"2016-02-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"On-Demand Geofilters","text":"Geofilters are one of our favorite parts of Snapchat.

We never want to create any misunderstanding over our commitment to protecting your privacy.First off, we want to be crystal clear: The Snaps and Chats you send your friends remain as private today as they were before the update. Our Privacy Policy continues to say—as it did before—that those messages “are automatically deleted from our servers once we detect that they have been viewed or have expired.” Of course, a recipient can always screenshot or save your Snaps or Chats. But the important point is that Snapchat is not—and never has been—stockpiling your private Snaps or Chats. And because we continue to delete them from our servers as soon as they’re read, we could not—and do not—share them with advertisers or business partners.It’s true that our Terms of Service grant us a broad license to use the content you create—a license that’s common to services like ours. We need that license when it comes to, for example, Snaps submitted to Live Stories, where we have to be able to show those Stories around the world—and even replay them or syndicate them (something we’ve said we could do in previous versions of our Terms and Privacy Policy). But we tried to be clear that the Privacy Policy and your own privacy settings within the app could restrict the scope of that license so that your personal communications continue to remain truly personal.You may wonder why we revised the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Here are a few of the key reasons:The main thing we did was to rewrite the Terms and Privacy Policy so that they’d read the way people actually talk. We always try to be upfront and clear with our community.We added language to the Terms of Service regarding in-app purchases. We needed to do that now that we’re selling Replays—and have some other cool products and services we’re looking forward to bringing to you soon.To make it a little easier for friends to find you on Snapchat, we’ve clarified what info—like your name—will be visible to other Snapchatters and how you can modify that info.Both the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are important documents, so we encourage all Snapchatters to read them. For more info, please check out Snapchat Support, including articles like When are Snaps and Chats deleted? and our Community Guidelines."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/a-whole-new-way-to-see-yourselfie","date":"2015-09-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"A Whole New Way to See Yourself(ie)","text":"We’re thrilled to announce a whole new way to express yourself on Snapchat. When you’re using the camera to take a selfie, just press and hold on your face to activate Lenses. You can play with Lenses before taking a Snap — just select one from the row at the bottom and follow the on-screen instructions!We introduced Replay in Additional Services almost two years ago, and we’ve used it to relive those amazing moments (or the ones we weren’t paying attention to…) just one more time before they disappear. We’ve provided one Replay per Snapchatter per day, sometimes frustrating the millions of Snapchatters who receive many daily Snaps deserving of a Replay. But then we realized — a Replay is like a compliment! So why stop at just one?Today, U.S. Snapchatters can purchase extra Replays, starting at 3 for $0.99. You can use a Replay on any Snap you receive, but you can only Replay any Snap once. They’re a little pricey — but time is money! ;)You’ll also find some fun surprises in this update, including Trophies (tucked above the camera)."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/tap-to-view","date":"2015-05-31T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Tap to View","text":"Today marks a pretty big change for Snapchat — you no longer have to press and hold the screen to view a Snap or Story — instead, simply Tap to View! This means no more tired thumbs while watching a several-hundred-second Story… and a little getting used to for anyone who has been Snapchatting for a while. We think you’re going to love it!There are also some new ways to make friends — including Add Nearby. It’s a quick way to add a group of friends when you’re all hanging out together. If everyone opens Add Nearby, a list of your friends will appear on the screen. Just tap to add.Snapcodes also got a serious upgrade :) You can add a selfie to the center of your Snapcode, so that it’s easier for friends to recognize you when you add them on Snapchat. If you see a Snapcode in another app, just take a screenshot. You can add screenshotted Snapcodes through Add Friends.Last but not least, we recently rolled out two-factor authentication to improve Snapchat security.

It’s fun to experience different perspectives through Snaps, Stories and Our Story.Today we’re introducing Discover.Snapchat Discover is a new way to explore Stories from different editorial teams. It’s the result of collaboration with world-class leaders in media to build a storytelling format that puts the narrative first. This is not social media.Social media companies tell us what to read based on what’s most recent or most popular. We see it differently. We count on editors and artists, not clicks and shares, to determine what’s important.Discover is different because it has been built for creatives. All too often, artists are forced to accommodate new technologies in order to distribute their work. This time we built the technology to serve the art: each edition includes full screen photos and videos, awesome long form layouts, and gorgeous advertising.Discover is new, but familiar. That’s because Stories are at the core - there’s a beginning, middle, and end so that editors can put everything in order. Every edition is refreshed after 24 hours - because what’s news today is history tomorrow.Discover is fun and easy to use. Tap to open an edition, swipe left to browse Snaps, or swipe up on a Snap for more. Each channel brings you something unique – a wonderful daily surprise!"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/community-geofilters","date":"2014-12-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Community Geofilters","text":"Our team has had a ton of fun drawing Geofilters and using them to decorate some of our favorite places around the world.

Starting today, we will notify Snapchatters when we have detected that they may be using third-party apps and we’ll ask those Snapchatters to change their password and stop using unauthorized apps.Most of you will see no difference in your Snapchat experience today.

Our team heard tons of requests for Our Story at college campuses – so we just had to make it happen.Some folks have been wondering how to access Our Campus Story. You’ll have to turn on location services so that Snapchat can determine your eligibility. For now, only Snapchatters whose phones indicate they’re in and around campus will be able to post to and view their Campus Story. Keep in mind that the accuracy of any device’s location information can be affected by operating systems and other apps.We can’t wait to roll out Our Campus Story to more schools across the world!

It’s the first time we’ve done anything like this because it’s the first time we’ve been paid to put content in that space. It’s going to feel a little weird at first, but we’re taking the plunge.The best advertisements tell you more about stuff that actually interests you. Some companies spend a lot of time and collect a lot of data about you to figure that out. The product we’re releasing today is a lot simpler. An advertisement will appear in your Recent Updates from time to time, and you can choose if you want to watch it. No biggie. It goes away after you view it or within 24 hours, just like Stories.We won’t put advertisements in your personal communication – things like Snaps or Chats. That would be totally rude. We want to see if we can deliver an experience that’s fun and informative, the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted. It’s nice when all of the brilliant creative minds out there get our attention with terrific content.Understandably, a lot of folks want to know why we’re introducing advertisements to our service. The answer is probably unsurprising – we need to make money. Advertising allows us to support our service while delivering neat content to Snapchatters.

We are grateful that the service provider acknowledged that Snapchat was never compromised, but we wanted to use this as an opportunity to reiterate the unfortunate threats these third-party applications can pose to our community.A third-party application is any application that accesses the Snapchat API, but hasn’t been built and maintained by our company. Given the popularity of Snapchat and the size of our community, it’s no surprise that a cottage industry of app-makers has popped up to provide additional services to Snapchatters. Unfortunately, these applications often ask for Snapchat login credentials and use them to send or receive snaps and access account information.When you give your login credentials to a third-party application, you’re allowing a developer, and possibly a criminal, to access your account information and send information on your behalf.It takes time and a lot of resources to build an open and trustworthy third-party application ecosystem. That’s why we haven’t provided a public API to developers and why we prohibit access to the private API we use to provide our service. Don’t get us wrong - we’re excited by the interest in developing for the Snapchat platform - but we’re going to take our time to get it right. Until then, that means any application that isn’t ours but claims to offer Snapchat services violates our Terms of Use and can’t be trusted.Snapchat has always been a fun place to share Snaps with friends. The best way to keep our community safe is a combination of security countermeasures and common sense. We’ll continue to do our part by improving Snapchat's security and calling on Apple and Google to take down third-party applications that access our API. You can help us out by avoiding the use of third-party applications."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/introducing-snapcash","date":"2014-09-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Introducing Snapcash","text":"Today is a big day for us - we are launching our first product created in partnership with another company.

Genius!We loved it so much that we wanted to create something with them that felt Snapchat-y. So we built a Snapcash prototype and shared it with the team at Square. Luckily for us, they were just as excited as we were and wanted to build it together.The product you’re seeing today is fast, fun, and incredibly simple.

Both agreements have much in common. Each resolved investigations that largely turned on how well users understood that recipients of their Snaps could save those Snaps. And each agreement concluded with Snapchat admitting no violation of any federal, state, or local law.But there is something else that both agreements have in common: They never allege, find, or suggest that Snapchat itself retains our users’ Snaps. That’s important. From day one, we have promised our users that we delete their Snaps from our servers once they’ve been viewed by all recipients. That’s a promise we’ve always honored, and it’s one that neither the FTC nor the Maryland AG has ever questioned.Instead, both agencies thought our users might not have fully appreciated the extent to which their Snaps could be saved by recipients, whether by taking a screenshot or using some other mechanism. Whatever the merit of that concern, it’s one that is old news by now. As we explained when we entered into our agreement, we long since revised our privacy policy and other public statements to make perfectly clear that—while Snapchat deletes all viewed Snaps from its servers—recipients can always save them.Our agreement also addresses the Maryland AG’s concern that users under 13 not get to use the app. Notably, the Maryland AG recognizes in this agreement that Snapchat’s terms of service have always provided that the app “is intended for use by people who are 13 years of age or older.” And Snapchat has instituted a number of controls to ensure that that limit is respected. Today’s agreement simply formalizes those controls.As we said when we announced our agreement with the FTC, Snapchat is—and always has been—devoted to promoting user privacy and giving Snapchatters control over how and with whom they communicate."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/our-ftc-agreement","date":"2014-05-07T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Our Agreement with the FTC","text":"When we started building Snapchat, we were focused on developing a unique, fast, and fun way to communicate with photos.

One of those was being more precise with how we communicated with the Snapchat community. This morning we entered into a consent decree with the FTC that addresses concerns raised by the commission. Even before today’s consent decree was announced, we had resolved most of those concerns over the past year by improving the wording of our privacy policy, app description, and in-app just-in-time notifications. And we continue to invest heavily in security and countermeasures to prevent abuse.We are devoted to promoting user privacy and giving Snapchatters control over how and with whom they communicate.

When we first started working on an application for sharing disappearing pictures, we had no idea how much we would learn. Our classmates were quick to point out that you could always take a screenshot. That led us to the notion of deletion by default – you keep what you want, and we’ll get rid of everything else!We also learned that conversation feels better when it’s visual. So we decided to make sure that every time you launch Snapchat we take you straight to the camera. It’s the fastest way to capture and share a moment on your smartphone.With our last product update, we honored the true nature of storytelling – every Story has a chronological order – a beginning, middle, and end. We built Stories to help Snapchatters create narratives and share them with all of their friends in just one tap.But until today, we felt that Snapchat was missing an important part of conversation: presence. There’s nothing like knowing you have the full attention of your friend while you’re chatting.We could not be more thrilled to announce Chat.Swipe right on a friend’s name in your Snapchat inbox to start chatting. When you leave the chat screen, messages viewed by both you and your friend will be cleared – but either of you can always tap or screenshot to save anything you’d like to keep (addresses, to-do lists, etc.)!We let you know when a friend is Here in your Chat so that you can give each other your full attention.

It is absolutely incredible to see so many young people gathered here together to build things. I really appreciate you including me.People frequently ask me about the keys to success and I’ve always been a bit curious myself.But it wasn’t until recently that I found the answer. I was fortunate enough to have my palm read by a wise old man in a Hong Kong temple. In addition to learning that I will be married and have a son before I am 30 - he also gave me the three keys to success.They are as follows:1. Hard Work2. Ability3. Human RelationshipsGiven that you are all here together at ten pm on a Friday night with the intention to work together for the next 36 hours - I don’t feel the need to elaborate on hard work or ability. You clearly have those in spades.So what I am going to focus on here tonight are human relationships, not the kind that are developed by exchanging business cards or adding each other on LinkedIn, but the kind that are formed over time, through deep, passionate, and spirited conversation.I thought I’d share something that we do at Snapchat that I learned at my high school, Crossroads, which they in turn borrowed from The Ojai Foundation - the practice of council. It may sound hokey to some of you, but it is really important to us. It means that once a week, for about an hour, groups of 10 or so team members get together and talk about how they feel. And just like there are three keys for success, there are three rules for council. The first is to always speak from the heart, the second is an obligation to listen, and the third is that everything that happens in council stays in council. We’ve found that this particular combination is incredibly useful for learning not only how to express what we feel, but for understanding and appreciating the feelings of others.A friend told me that you know you love someone when they’re the person you want to share your stories with and I’d add that they’re likely the person you most want to listen to.So without discounting the importance of speaking from the heart or listening thoughtfully, I want to talk about the notion that what happens in council stays in council. Ensuring that the feelings expressed during council aren’t shared publicly creates a space for us to make ourselves vulnerable. It allows us to share our deepest, most unique thoughts - thoughts and feelings that might be easily misunderstood in a different context. Put more simply: we respect the privacy of council.Unfortunately, privacy is too often articulated as secrecy, when, as Nissenbaum points out, privacy is actually focused on an understanding of context. Not what is said – but where it is said and to whom. Privacy allows us to enjoy and learn from the intimacy that is created when we share different things with different people in different contexts.Kundera writes, “in private we bad-mouth our friends and use coarse language; that we act different in private than in public is everyone’s most conspicuous experience, it is the very ground of the life of the individual; curiously, this obvious fact remains unconscious, unacknowledged, forever obscured by lyrical dreams of the transparent glass house, it is rarely understood to be the value one must defend above all others.”In America, before the Internet, the division between our public and private lives was usually tied to our physical location – our work and our home. The context in which we were communicating with our friends and family was clear. At work, we were professionals, and at home we were husbands, wives, sons or daughters.There are few better at understanding the difference between public and private expression than celebrities, whose public personalities can generate significant interest in their private lives. When ones privacy is threatened, when the context in which one shares is collapsed, public and private become clearly distinct.While walking through an airport recently, I was struck by a Newsweek Special Issue that promised to reveal Marilyn Monroe’s “Lost Scrapbook.” Indeed, a journalist had found a scrapbook that she had created for a photographer and friend.The journalist writes about the scrapbook, “It’s Marilyn being natural, having messy hair and not worrying about what somebody might think of her or how they might look at her. She’s not looking at the composition of the pictures. She’s looking at what she’s doing in the pictures. She likes having fun.”The pages are colorful, with Marilyn’s thoughts and feelings scrawled beside the imagery. Next to one photo of herself in a bathrobe surrounded by production gear, she writes, “a girl has no privacy when she works.” Marilyn felt that her scrapbook was a private place to share with her photographer friend. It wasn’t part of her public persona.The Internet encourages us to create scrapbooks of our feelings that are shared, potentially without context, for the enjoyment of our friends, or our “audience.” Our feelings become expressed as information – they are used to categorize and profile our existence.On the Internet, we organize information by its popularity in an attempt to determine its validity. If a website has been referenced by many other websites, then it is generally determined to be more valuable or accurate. Feelings expressed on social media are quantified, validated, and distributed in a similar fashion. Popular expression becomes the most valuable expression.Social media businesses represent an aggressive expansion of capitalism into our personal relationships. We are asked to perform for our friends, to create things they like, to work on a “personal brand” - and brands teach us that authenticity is the result of consistency. We must honor our “true self” and represent the same self to all of our friends or risk being discredited.But humanity cannot be true or false. We are full of contradictions and we change. That is the joy of human life. We are not brands; it is simply not in our nature.Technology has perpetuated the myth of the transparent glass house and created a culture that values popular opinion over critical thought. We have allowed ourselves to believe that more information equals more knowledge. And increasingly, we live in a time when, as Rosen describes, “intimate personal information originally disclosed to our friends and colleagues may be exposed to—and misinterpreted by—a less understanding audience.”Every time we express ourselves, we do so with the understanding that things we say might become permanently and publicly known. We are encouraged to express ourselves in ways that are accepted by the largest possible audience. We lose our individuality in favor of popular acceptance.My concern is that we have developed a generation of people who believe that successful leaders are those with followers. I believe that the best leaders are those that stand for something, who have a point of view. And that point of view must be developed, not alone, but in private, or risk becoming normalized in search of popular support.For encouragement, I’ve often relied on these words spoken by Roosevelt at the Sorbonne, who declares, “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”We have built a society where all too frequently the men the in the arena are fighting not for their lives, not for their family, nor for their point of view – but for the spectators and for the applause. And we, the spectators, sitting in the arena, happily entertained, drunk and well fed – we are full – but are we happy?Kundera writes that “when it becomes the custom and the rule to divulge another person’s private life, we are entering a time when the highest stake is the survival or the disappearance of the individual.”I believe that time is now.I will leave you with words from the final paragraph of a speech that was to be delivered by President Kennedy, on the day he was assassinated. On that day, Kennedy would have spoken during a time of war. Tonight, I ask you to listen as we face the battle to prevent the destruction of the individual.“We, in this country, in this generation, are — by destiny rather than by choice — the watchmen on the walls of world freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our power and responsibility, that we may exercise our strength with wisdom and restraint, and that we may achieve in our time and for all time the ancient vision of “peace on earth, good will toward men.” That must always be our goal, and the righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength. For as was written long ago: “except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen waketh but in vain.”We are all here to erase the stigma that says hacking has to do primarily with exposing things that others do not wish to have exposed. I challenge all of you to create a space this weekend, during this very important time, which honors and respects the thoughts, feelings and dreams of others. We have come here to find comfort and joy in sharing and creating – we must build thoughtfully for our future generations that they may discover the joys of human relationship and individual expression, as protected by privacy."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/evan-axs-partner-summit-2014","date":"2014-01-26T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"2014 AXS Partner Summit Keynote","text":"I’ve always thought it was a bit odd that this period in our history has been called the “post-personal computer” era – when really it should be called the “more-personal computer” era.I read a great story yesterday about a man named Mister Macintosh. He was a man designed by Steve Jobs to live inside the Macintosh computer when it launched, 30 years ago from yesterday. He would appear every so often, hidden behind a pull-down menu or popping out from behind an icon – just quickly and infrequently enough that you almost thought he wasn’t real.Until yesterday, I hadn’t realized that Steve’s idea of tying a man to a computer had happened so early in his career. But, at the time, the Macintosh was forced to ship without Mister Macintosh because the engineers were constrained to only 128 kilobytes of memory. It wasn’t until much later in Steve’s career that he would truly tie man to machine – the launch of the iPhone on June 29, 2007.In the past, technical constraints meant that computers were typically found in physical locations: the car, the home, the school. The iPhone tied a computer uniquely to a phone number – to YOU.Not all that long ago, communication was location-dependent. We were either in the same room together, in which case we could talk face-to-face, or we were across the world from each other, in which case I could call your office or send a letter to your home. It is only very recently that we have begun to tie phone numbers to individual identities for the purpose of computation and communication.I say all this to establish that smartphones are simply the culmination of Steve’s journey to identify man with machine – and bring about the age of the More-Personal Computer.There are three characteristics of the More-Personal Computer that are particularly relevant to our work at Snapchat:1) Internet Everywhere2) Fast + Easy Media Creation3) EphemeralityWhen we first started working on Snapchat in 2011, it was just a toy. In many ways it still is – but to quote Eames, “Toys are not really as innocent as they look. Toys and games are preludes to serious ideas.”The reason to use a toy doesn’t have to be explained – it’s just fun. But using a toy is a terrific opportunity to learn.And boy, have we been learning.Internet Everywhere means that our old conception of the world separated into an online and an offline space is no longer relevant. Traditional social media required that we live experiences in the offline world, record those experiences, and then post them online to recreate the experience and talk about it. For example, I go on vacation, take a bunch of pictures, come back home, pick the good ones, post them online, and talk about them with my friends.This traditional social media view of identity is actually quite radical: you are the sum of your published experience. Otherwise known as: pics or it didn’t happen.Or in the case of Instagram: beautiful pics or it didn’t happen AND you’re not cool.This notion of a profile made a lot of sense in the binary experience of online and offline. It was designed to recreate who I am online so that people could interact with me even if I wasn’t logged on at that particular moment.Snapchat relies on Internet Everywhere to provide a totally different experience. Snapchat says that we are not the sum of everything we have said or done or experienced or published – we are the result. We are who we are today, right now.We no longer have to capture the “real world” and recreate it online – we simply live and communicate at the same time.Communication relies on the creation of media and is constrained by the speed at which that media is created and shared. It takes time to package your emotions, feelings and thoughts into media content like speech, writing, or photography.Indeed, humans have always used media to understand themselves and share with others. I’ll spare you the Gaelic with this translation of Robert Burns, “Oh would some power the gift give us, to see ourselves as others see us.”When I heard that quote, I couldn’t help but think of self-portraits. Or for us Millennials: the selfie! Self-portraits help us understand the way that others see us – they represent how we feel, where we are, and what we’re doing. They are arguably the most popular form of self-expression.In the past, lifelike self-portraits took weeks and millions of brush strokes to complete. In the world of Fast + Easy Media Creation, the selfie is immediate. It represents who we are and how we feel – right now.And until now, the photographic process was far too slow for conversation. But with Fast + Easy Media Creation we are able to communicate through photos, not just communicate around them like we did on social media. When we start communicating through media we light up. It’s fun.The selfie makes sense as the fundamental unit of communication on Snapchat because it marks the transition between digital media as self-expression and digital media as communication.And this brings us to the importance of ephemerality at the core of conversation.Snapchat discards content to focus on the feeling that content brings to you, not the way that content looks. This is a conservative idea, the natural response to radical transparency that restores integrity and context to conversation.Snapchat sets expectations around conversation that mirror the expectations we have when we’re talking in-person.That’s what Snapchat is all about. Talking through content not around it. With friends, not strangers. Identity tied to now, today. Room for growth, emotional risk, expression, mistakes, room for YOU.The Era of More Personal Computing has provided the technical infrastructure for more personal communication. We feel so fortunate to be a part of this incredible transformation.Snapchat is a product built from the heart – that is the reason why we are in Los Angeles. I often talk with people about the conflicts between technology companies and content companies – I’ve found that one of the biggest issues is that frequently technology companies view movies, music, and television as INFORMATION. Directors, producers, musicians, and actors view them as feelings, as expression. Not to be searched, sorted, and viewed – but EXPERIENCED.Snapchat focuses on the experience of conversation – not the transfer of information. We’re thrilled to be a part of this community.Thank you for inviting me today and thank you for being a part of our journey. Our team looks forward to getting to know all of you."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/snap-spam-update-2014","date":"2014-01-12T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Snap Spam Update","text":"We’ve heard some complaints over the weekend about an increase in Snap Spam on our service.

This sentiment wrongly assumes that documentation and experience are essentially at odds, a conceptual remnant of how we used to think of photography, as an art object, as content, rather than what it is often today, less an object and more a sharing of experience. But not all social media are built the same, and I think we can use a distinction in social platforms: those that are based in social media versus those that are more fundamentally about communication.Researcher Sherry Turkle discusses this in a recent New York Times op-ed, describing how very-famous comedian Aziz Ansari greets his fans on the street. They want a photo with him, some documentary proof, but he instead offers conversation about his work, leaving many fans unsatisfied. Turkle extrapolates this encounter as representative of how social media works in general, which, I think, is a significant misunderstanding of, and disconnection from, how people use social services today. Meeting a famous person is that special moment you may want proof of; conversation might be nice, but with a celebrity it will be a one-sided affair, they will likely not remember you or keep the conversation going at a later date. To compare everyday sociality online as akin to meeting a celebrity, as Turkle does, is inaccurate. Sure, meeting Ansari might be a situation where some desire a document more than conversation, but everyday digitally-mediated social interaction is often less about the media object but rather centered in a back-and-forth reciprocal dialogue, something different social services can encourage or preclude, depending how they’re designed.The way to understand photography as it happens on social platforms is not to compare it to traditional photography, which is about creating an art object, but instead as a communicating of experience itself. It’s less making media and more sharing eyes; your view, your experience in the now. The atomizing of the ephemeral flow of lived reality into transmittable objects is the ends of the traditional photograph, but merely the means of the social snap. As photos have become almost comically easy to make, their existence alone as objects isn’t special or interesting, rather, they exist more fluidly as communication; a visual discourse more linguistic than formally artistic. As such, social photography should be understood not as a remove from the moment or conversation but a deeply social immersion.Turkle centers her analysis on selfies—those photos you take of yourself—arguing that we are trading the experience of the moment for its documentation. But when viewing selfies as not an abundance of self-portrait photographs but rather a sharing of experience, a communication of this is who I am, I was here, I was feeling like this, the commonality of selfies isn’t surprising or anti-social at all. Selfies, largely, are not recording the exceptionally rare events with famous people but exactly the opposite, the everyday moments that weave the fabric of life in all of its variety. An immaculately framed and perfectly lit photo of the beach makes for a good art object can be a pretty boring speech act given how that same shot multiplies in social feeds looking kind of the same. Instead, the selfie is the image-speak that is uniquely yours, no one else can take your selfie, it is your own voice-as-image and is thus especially intimate and expressive. It’s intensely in the moment and that’s exactly why we desire to share and view them.***Through this example of modern photo sharing, the distinction being made here is between social services that are primarily fixated on content versus communication. All social media is both, of course, but not all media focus on both equally.Today’s dominate social services are very concerned with the media object, the singular slice of experience that is pulled apart, made discrete, placed in a profile or stream, and given all sorts of metrics to quantify how many people appreciate it. More simply, dominant social media organize their sites and your experience around these media objects, be they photos, videos, chunks of text, check-ins, and so on. They are the fundamental unit of experience for you to click on, comment on, and share. A photo is posted, and the conversation happens around it, side-by-side, on the screen.Alternatively, one key component of ephemeral social media—appreciated by its users but unexplored in most analyses—is that it rejects this fundamental unit of organization. There are no comments displayed on a Snap, no hearts or likes. With ephemerality, communication is done through photos rather than around them.That media object, say, a photo, is the ends of dominant social media, but merely the means for services that are ephemeral, letting the media object fade away and making disposable the very thing that other services are built upon. Like the proliferating selfies, the actual photographic object is merely a byproduct of communication rather than its focus.By diminishing the importance of the media object, by making it disposable, the emphasis is placed on communication itself. This goes a long way to explain the intimacy of a Snap versus a static image shared on another site. Other services, even their direct messaging components, are organized by and around persistent media objects. This is the media based sociality that gives social media its name.An image becomes a photograph, in part, by having borders. The frame makes the photo. Tellingly, a Snapchat usually exists unframed, full-screen, more moment than an art object. Less than sharing experience-trophies and hoping communication happens around them, an ephemeral network leaves the art objects to fade in favor of focusing on the moments, the experience, the communication; more social than media, more social than network.Perhaps the reason most of our dominate social media have been fixated on content, on media objects, is because content can be stored. Sociality is treated like information that can be indexed as search engines do to the Web. Photos and the rest are recorded, kept, organized into profiles to be measured and tracked and ranked. It made sense, that’s largely what people used desktop computers to do. Perhaps it was the rise of the mobile phone, where people do less information searching and more communicating that revealed this as a flawed model for organizing anything social. I’m concluding on a highly speculative note here, but it is certainly time to rethink sociality based so fundamentally on media objects.One can still understand the appeal of the media object and why we continue to want to produce and consume those beautiful moments placed within a photo border. The band you are watching at their most intense, the sun setting, the family gathering, meeting a famous comedian: there’s certainly a place for the important photo, saved permanently. As I often argue, ephemeral and permanent social media work together rather than in opposition. Even Snaps are often turned into great pieces of art.But as easy as it is to appreciate the importance of those special moments, it is equally easy to underestimate the seemingly banal moments in-between. Those who study the social world appreciate the complexities of the seemingly trivial. What is often thought to be the boring, mundane parts of everyday life are instead profoundly important. Minor social groomings make up the textures of our lives: saying hello, smiling, acknowledging each other, our faces, our stuff, and our moods from good to bad. Permanent social media have a difficult time capturing these important trivialities in a comfortable way. And this is exactly where ephemeral social media excels; built for everyday communication in its fleeting, often fun, always important nature. By not trying treating social life as just about capturing moments as trophies, ephemeral social media is more familiar, it emphasizes everyday sociality, and that is anything but trivial."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/friends-abuse","date":"2014-01-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Find Friends Abuse","text":"When we first built Snapchat, we had a difficult time finding other friends that were using the service. We wanted a way to find friends in our address book that were also using Snapchat – so we created Find Friends. Find Friends is an optional service that asks Snapchatters to enter their phone number so that their friends can find their username. This means that if you enter your phone number into Find Friends, someone who has your phone number in his or her address book can find your username.A security group first published a report about potential Find Friends abuse in August 2013. Shortly thereafter, we implemented practices like rate limiting aimed at addressing these concerns. On Christmas Eve, that same group publicly documented our API, making it easier for individuals to abuse our service and violate our Terms of Use.We acknowledged in a blog post last Friday that it was possible for an attacker to use the functionality of Find Friends to upload a large number of random phone numbers and match them with Snapchat usernames. On New Years Eve, an attacker released a database of partially redacted phone numbers and usernames. No other information, including Snaps, was leaked or accessed in these attacks.We will be releasing an updated version of the Snapchat application that will allow Snapchatters to opt out of appearing in Find Friends after they have verified their phone number. We’re also improving rate limiting and other restrictions to address future attempts to abuse our service.We want to make sure that security experts can get ahold of us when they discover new ways to abuse our service so that we can respond quickly to address those concerns. The best way to let us know about security vulnerabilities is by emailing us: security@snapchat.com.The Snapchat community is a place where friends feel comfortable expressing themselves and we’re dedicated to preventing abuse."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/friends-phone-numbers","date":"2013-12-26T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Finding Friends with Phone Numbers","text":"Occasionally computer security professionals and other helpful people reach out to us about potential bugs and vulnerabilities in Snapchat.

This documentation included an allegation regarding a possible attack by which one could compile a database of Snapchat usernames and phone numbers.Our Find Friends feature allows users to upload their address book contacts to Snapchat so that we can display the accounts of Snapchatters who match the phone numbers found in the address book. Adding a phone number to your Snapchat account is optional, but it’s helpful for allowing your friends to find you. We don’t display the phone numbers to other users and we don’t support the ability to look up phone numbers based on someone’s username.Theoretically, if someone were able to upload a huge set of phone numbers, like every number in an area code, or every possible number in the U.S., they could create a database of the results and match usernames to phone numbers that way.

So what happens to them before they are opened? Most of Snapchat’s infrastructure is hosted on Google’s cloud computing service, App Engine. Most of our data, including unopened Snaps, are kept in App Engine’s datastore until they are deleted.RetrievalIs Snapchat capable of retrieving unopened Snaps from the datastore? Yes—if we couldn’t retrieve Snaps from the datastore, we wouldn’t be able to deliver them to their recipients desired by the sender. Do we manually retrieve and look at Snaps under ordinary circumstances? No. The ordinary process of sending Snaps to their recipient(s) is automated.So what is a circumstance when we might manually retrieve a Snap, assuming it is still unopened? For example, there are times when we, like other electronic communication service providers, are permitted and sometimes compelled by law to access and disclose information. For example, if we receive a search warrant from law enforcement for the contents of Snaps and those Snaps are still on our servers, a federal law called the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) obliges us to produce the Snaps to the requesting law enforcement agency. For more information, see the section of our Privacy Policy that discusses circumstances when we may disclose information.Since May 2013, about a dozen of the search warrants we’ve received have resulted in us producing unopened Snaps to law enforcement. That’s out of 350 million Snaps sent every day. Law enforcement requests sometimes require us to preserve Snaps for a time, like when law enforcement is determining whether to issue a search warrant for Snaps.Only two people in the company currently have access to the tool used for manually retrieving unopened Snaps, our co-founder and CTO, Bobby (who coded it), and me.Okay, so what about Stories?The biggest difference between Stories and Snaps is that unless deleted by the user, Stories are available for 24 hours and can be viewed repeatedly in that time. Unlike unopened Snaps, which are stored until viewed or for 30 days if not opened, Snaps that have been added to your Stories are deleted from our servers after 24 hours. Stories are subject to the same legal requirements for access and disclosure as described above for Snaps.Community GuidelinesOur Terms of Use and Community Guidelines let you know the rules for using Snapchat. If we receive a report that a user is breaking the rules, we may review the Story they’ve posted and take appropriate action. This may include deleting a Story, showing a warning on an account, or even terminating an account.Our Privacy Policy contains more information about our practices. We hope this post has given you a better sense of how we operate. We are constantly amazed by your creativity and enthusiasm. Thank you for building such an awesome community."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/liquid-self","date":"2013-09-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"The Liquid Self","text":"Social media doesn’t need to be what it has come to be. Social media is young, growth comes with pains, and we should keep questioning assumptions and push this new media to new limits. My first post on the Snapchat blog, fittingly, questioned the assumed permanence of social media content. Permanent content is just one option, a choice with far-ranging implications, and it isn’t necessary. Here, I’d like to think about one major consequence of permanence: the social media profile.The familiar social media profile is that collection of information about you and/or created by you, usually with some other people you’re connected to. Profiles structure identity in more or less constraining ways: real name policies, lists of information about our preferences, detailed histories and current activities all comprise a highly structured set of boxes to squeeze oneself into. Further, as our documented histories grow, the profile grows both in literal size as well as in weight on our minds and behaviors.The social media profile attempts to convince us that life, in all its ephemeral flow, should also be its simulation; the ephemeral flow of lived experience is to be hacked into a collection of separate, discrete, objects to be shoved into the profile containers. The logic of the profile is that life should be captured, preserved, and put behind glass. It asks us to be collectors of our lives, to create a museum of our self. Moments are chunked off, put in a grid, quantified, and ranked. Permanent social media are based on such profiles, with each being more or less constraining and grid-like. Rethinking permanence means rethinking this kind of social media profile, and it introduces the possibility of a profile not as a collection preserved behind glass but something more living, fluid, and always changing.***Recording identity into categories on social media isn’t all bad and my goal here is not to argue they should disappear, but rather ask if they can be rethought, made into only an option and perhaps not the default? Can social media be created that doesn’t ask us to work ourselves into as many identity-containers given that humans and identity itself are fundamentally fluid and ever changing?To get at this, let’s think for a moment about that common, and distinctly modern, cultural truism found in children’s stories, self-help books, and everyday advice asking us to be true to ourselves. We are to discover and remain faithful to that real, authentic version of who we are. It can often be good advice, but if you cringed at reading the word “authentic” any bit as much as I did typing it, then you already know that advice can leave little room for anything other than having just one self, regardless of time and place, and as such runs the risk of discouraging change. There’s another school of thought, one that understands identity as never solidified and always in flux. Instead of a single, unchanging self, we might consider a ‘liquid self’, one more verb than noun.This is abstract, I know, and we won’t settle this philosophical debate on a blog, but the Internet has played an Interesting role in this tension between identity consistency and change. The tale is a familiar one by now: the Web arrived pregnant with the possibility of rethinking who we are by transcending geographic location, physical ability, as well as things like race, gender, age, even species [though, this detachment was always only a fantasy]. The New Yorker cartoon infamously joked that, “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog”. As the story goes, however, the Web went mainstream and commercial. It got normal and somewhere along the way spontaneous anonymity became replaced by consistent identity. Now that everyone knows you’re a dog, it’s difficult to be anything but.Social media has come to put a tremendous emphasis on our own identity, constantly recorded, always accumulating, stored, and presented back to us in an always-available profile of ourselves. Yes, Identity can be a source of importance, meaning, history, and pleasure, but, today, identity is rapidly piling up, exponentially increasing our own contact with ourselves. The profile photo, the background, what you like, what you do, who your friends are all lead to a never ending and always growing self-surveillance that’s paired with a healthy dose of being watched by others, too. What can be in one breath “self-expression” can be in another “self-policing” when who you are (and thus who you are not) become increasingly part of everyday life.Self-expression, when bundled into permanent category boxes (digital or otherwise), has the danger of becoming increasingly constraining and self-restricting. Given that pressure to be “real”, authentic, and “true to yourself” as mentioned above, this massive evidence of one’s own self can become limiting and impede identity change. My worry here is that today’s dominant social media is too often premised on the idea (and ideal) of having one, true, unchanging, stable self and as such fails to accommodate playfulness and revision. It has been built around the logic of highly structured boxes and categories, most with quantifiers that numerically rank every facet of our content, and this grid-patterned data-capture machine simply does not comfortably accommodate the reality that humans are fluid, changing, and messy in ways both tragic and wonderful.***While social media is in its adolescence, it has yet to comfortably incorporate adolescence itself. By that I do not mean young people specifically, but instead the type of change and growth that is healthy regardless of age. The default of requiring social media users to permanently record and display themselves damages the invaluable importance of identity play. Put differently: many of us desire social media that is less like the mall and more like a park. Being far less standardized, constrained, and policed, yes, the park is somewhere you might do something a little dumb. Knees get scraped. But mistakes shouldn’t be fully avoided, which is what dominate, permanent social media demand, resulting in constant over-anxiety about what’s being posted. A healthy corrective to existing social media would be to create platforms that provide more room to behave without that behavior always defining who one is and what one can do. The idea of non-patrolled spaces for expression can be frightening, but a lack of such spaces is far more worrisome.*Dominate social media has thus far taken a stand, a radical one in my opinion, for a version of identity that is highly categorized and omnipresent, one that forces an ideal of a singular, stable identity that we will continuously have to confront. It is a philosophy that doesn’t capture the real messiness and fluidity of the self, fails to celebrate growth, and is particularly bad for those most socially-vulnerable. I wonder how we can build social media that doesn’t always intensify our own relationship to ourselves by way of identity boxes. I think temporary social media will provide new ways of understanding the social media profile, one that isn’t comprised of life hacked into frozen, quantifiable pieces but instead something more fluid, changing, and alive.*Note: The idea that a person should have a single, stable, true or authentic identity is most difficult for those who are more socially vulnerable. Having only one, unchanging identity may not seem all that problematic if who you are is not often stigmatized and penalized. However, there needs to be far more recognition that many people justifiably enjoy and need some social-closets where identity can be played with and not put on bright display because the potential consequences are greater. Race, class, sex, sexuality, ability, age, and all the other various intersections of power and vulnerability need to be part of the discussions around how social media is built, used, and improved."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/temporary-social-media","date":"2013-07-18T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Temporary Social Media","text":"Technology has a way of making time simultaneously important and baffling. Communication technologies from speaking to writing to recording sound and sight disrupt temporality, mixing the past, present, and future in unpredictable new ways. This chaotic atemporality is part social media’s interest–or at least it’s what interests me. Specifically, the fact that the social media built so far has a particular, and peculiar, orientation to time: an assumed inevitability of recording most everything forever.Most of our personal understandings of, as well as research on, social media presume that what we do online can be and likely is permanent. The photo posted today will be around tomorrow. Sometimes that is a satisfying thought: that we can one day look fondly upon this moment. Sometimes it’s the horrifying notion that something we are doing now will come back to bite us later. While there is some research on the deletion of social media content–for instance danah boyd’s terrific work on “white-walling” where users periodically delete their content–most of our understandings of social media assume content is mostly permanent. For instance, Rob Horning rightly points out, that the “self” is increasingly intertwined with data and social media documentation, arguing,ubiquitous surveillance will be the fundamental fact about subjectivity from here on out. There will no sense of self that doesn’t take into account how the self has been or will be recorded, how that self will turn up as an artifact of online searches“Recorded” and “artifact” are certainly appropriate terms now, with the former assuming the latter. But does recording always need to be seen as an inevitable future artifact? Do we need to continue to assume that social media content needs to be forever? I’m curious as to what happens to identity if social media emphasizes less enduring recordings and instead something more temporary. It would be identity less concerned with itself as a constant “artifact”, a less nostalgic understanding of the present as a potential future past and instead an identity a bit more of the present, for the present.Simply, what if we rethought the whole idea of the assumed permanence of social media? What if social media, in all its varieties, was differently oriented to time by promoting temporariness by design? What would the various social media sites look like if ephemerality was the default and permanence, at most, an option?It’s easy to underestimate the significance of injecting more ephemerality into social media. But to make social media more temporary fundamentally alters our relationships to online visibility, to data privacy, content ownership, the “right to forget.” It alters the functioning of social stigma, shame, and identity itself.Beyond the ‘right to forget’, what about the possible erosion of the obligation to remember?***We think about how the high school student’s name will appear in search results years down the road, or how presidential candidates will run against their own online profiles of past. Indeed, that common declaration, “I’m so glad I didn’t have social media when I was young!” is ultimately a way of asserting how big a problem our present will be when excavated in the future. The message is often that we should be ashamed about what we are doing, that what we are creating now will bring stigma in the future.It is deeply important to recognize the harm that permanent media can bring–and that this harm is not evenly distributed. Those with non-normative identities or who are otherwise socially vulnerable have much more at stake being more likely to encounter the potential damages past data can cause by way of shaming and stigma. When social media companies make privacy mistakes it is often folks who are not straight, white, and male who pay the biggest price. This is why movements like the right to be forgotten are so crucial.There is, however, a tension here: we should be careful not to couch the possible benefits of temporary social media as promoting hiding from your past in shame. As I’ve argued before,When we applaud not having records of our own embarrassing past, a document of how we’ve changed over time as individuals, we are equally celebrating the cultural norm that expects perfection, normalization, and unchanging behavior. What if more people wore past identities more proudly? We could erode the norm of identity consistency, a norm no one lives up to anyways, and embrace change and growth for its own sake. Perhaps the popularity of social media will force more people to confront the reality that identity isn’t and can’t be flawlessly consistent.Framing data deletion as about hiding from one’s past might actually further the stigma of a little digital dirt, that being human and changing is something to be ashamed of. A healthier attitude towards our documented pasts would be to embrace how different we were before, even if there are significant mistakes. Change could be seen as not a flaw but a positive, as evidence of growth; an identity feature rather than a flaw.***I’d like to suggest a second a way of understanding temporary social media, not as hiding from the past but as embracing the present. I began writing about Snapchat in an essay for The New Inquiry this past February arguing that one thing ephemeral media like Snapchat does is change our everyday vision from using social media to focus on a series of future pasts to embracing the present for its own sake. While documenting our lives isn’t new, the types and degree is: social media, smartphones, and the rest of our proliferating technologies of documentation encourage people to view the world in the present as a potential photo, GIF, video, status update, check-in to be archived. And, importantly, social media in particular provides an audience for our ephemera, which is partly responsible for our willingness to document ourselves and others so thoroughly.  This culture of documentation in the age of social media has emerged as particularly nostalgic. Because what we do on social media is so often quite permanent, this ‘documentary vision’ tends to be a sentimental gaze. The faux-vintage photo filters that have made recent digital snapshots look as if they were aged by time are a terrific example of the ‘nostalgia for the present’ that happens when almost any moment can be so perfectly remembered. Permanent social media encourages an understanding of the present as documentable. Conversely, temporary social media is anti-nostalgia, letting the present be good enough right where it is.Because of this, temporary social media has a complicated relationship with memory. Part of the appeal of permanent social media is being able to look back and remember so much of our lives. But the logic that the more we save the more we remember might break down at some level of hyper-documentation, perhaps remembering things less if they are perfectly recorded. By offloading memories and some of the work of remembering to databases, we don’t really need to remember that vacation because it’s been so thoroughly stored in expanding digital photo albums; archives so numerous that they’ve become increasingly trivial to the point that you may rarely check back in on them at all. Alternatively, not recording something for posterity can mean remembering more. For example, the Snapchat countdown timer demands an urgency of attention; when you look fast, you look hard. The image might not be perfectly remembered but the story it tells and how you feel in that moment become most salient. Permanent social media fixates on the details of a photo, whereas temporary social media fixates on what it meant and what it moved within you.In this way, temporary social media might also be an antithesis to social media triviality. Typically, to document something was to declare its worthiness of attention; but when documentation expands so exponentially, as is occurring today, the importance lessens. In the near future the near past will be less scarce because the current present is so abundant. Logging into social streams today often feels like a bazaar of banality, the everyday ephemera that populates these sites has deeply eroded any essential link between “document” and “importance”. When photographs were scarcer, photographic documentation inferred some level of importance whereas today the sight of someone photographing their burrito is a joke. The abundance of photographic documentation has created its own inverse: not photographing a moment often conveys importance, for instance, not snapping a picture of your food can demonstrate respect for the establishment and your company. In the age of hyper documentation, the photograph specifically and documentation in general are becoming less about importance and more about banality. Temporary social media creates some much needed scarcity, interrupting the cycle of documentary accumulation by not allowing them to amass. We’ve been hoarders of the evidence of our own lives; there is no important archeology when everything is saved.***Am I fetishizing the ephemeral, the present, the current moment? To a degree, yes. Social media is young, and I hope it grows out of this assumed permanence of our data. A corrective, an injection of ephemerality, is badly needed and overdue. The present doesn’t always need to be owned, held still and fixed; sometimes it might be best left alone to simply be what it is, letting more moments pass not undocumented and unshared, but just without enforced documentary boxes and categories with corresponding metrics filed away in growing databases. Instead, temporary social media treats the present as less like something that aspires to be curated into a museum but as something that can be unknown, unclassified, not put to work.None of this is to say we should give up on more enduring documentation. Temporary social media does not really oppose durable social media. As I admit above, many of us cherish artifacts from the past. There is an appeal to a timeline of important life-events. But permanence shouldn’t be the standard, and perhaps not even the default. Let’s better consider time as a variable in a complex social media ecology where things aren’t so often shared forever. Yes, many existing sites have some deletion capabilities on their platforms, but what if more social media has ephemerality built in from the ground up?These are the sorts of questions and issues I want to work on and encourage others to think more about. The Web doesn’t mean the end of forgetting; indeed, it has demanded it."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/recent-additions","date":"2013-06-23T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Recent Additions to Team Snapchat","text":"When we launched Snapchat in September 2011, we were finally ready to share something we loved with the rest of the world. We had created a different way to communicate with our friends - it felt more personal, and it was a lot more fun. We hoped the rest of the world would love it too.The response has been absolutely mind blowing. Less than two years later, Snapchatters are sharing over 200 million snaps every day. And thanks to our incredible and hardworking team, we’ve been able to support the growth of Snapchat with minimal overhead.But in order to continue scaling while developing the Snapchat experience, we needed to build a bigger engineering team and figure out how to pay our server bills.We’re fortunate to welcome IVP to Team Snapchat as the lead investor in our recent Series B financing. General Catalyst, Benchmark Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and SV Angel also participated in the round. We are thankful for their belief in the Snapchat community and we look forward to working with them as we continue to grow.We have also added Michael Lynton as an independent board member. Michael is a remarkably talented and creative executive who believed in Snapchat way before it was cool. He is a tremendous role model and we are grateful for his time and energy.Long story short – we’re committed to building a big company around an innovative and fun product. And we know we can’t do it without you. So thank you for your endless support and enthusiasm for Snapchat. It means the world to us.There are some really exciting surprises around the corner…"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/bug-fixes","date":"2013-06-21T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"iOS Update: Bug Fixes and More","text":"Team Snapchat has been growing by leaps and bounds this month. The arrival of summer has brought with it summer engineering interns and other new members of the team. We’re excited to be picking up the pace of development!There’s a new iOS version available in the App Store today. It includes some critical fixes for bugs and crashes, so please download it if you’ve been experiencing issues.We’re also trying out something new in this release. As you may know, Snapchat is for teens and adults– children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create accounts. The previous iOS update introduced age-gating, in which we asked people their age on the registration screen and didn’t allow them to proceed if the age entered was under 13. This was a pretty standard way of handling things, but it didn’t provide a very good experience. So now, in addition to age-gating, we’ve decided to try something a little different.In the new iOS version, kids under the age of 13 are able to fill out the registration form, however their user information is not sent to us and an account is not created. Instead they are able to use “SnapKidz” a version of Snapchat that includes an interface for taking snaps, captioning, drawing, and saving them locally on the device, but does not support sending or receiving snaps or adding friends. We’re trying it out first on iOS and if all goes well, we hope to include it in an upcoming Android update.While we were at it, we updated our Privacy Policy. We hope that the new version provides more detailed information about our practices. Don’t worry though, we haven’t changed the way we handle your information, including storing and deleting snaps.We also tweaked our Terms of Use to account for SnapKidz and a few other things that needed updating. We’ll be editing the Terms of Use from time to time as we continue to make it easier to read and understand.Happy Snapping!"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/snaps-stored","date":"2013-05-08T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"How Snaps Are Stored & Deleted","text":"There’s been some speculation lately about how snaps are stored and when and how they are deleted. We’ve always tried to be upfront about how things work and we haven’t made any changes to our practices, so we thought it’d be cool to go over things in a bit more detail.Storing SnapsWhen someone sends a snap, it is uploaded to our servers, the recipient(s) are sent a notification that they have a new snap and the Snapchat app downloads a copy of the message. The image or video from the message is stored in a temporary folder in the device’s memory. This is sometimes in internal memory, RAM or external memory like an SD Card—depending on the platform and whether it’s a video or a picture.Deleting Snaps From Our ServersWhen a snap is viewed and the timer runs out, the app notifies our servers, which in turn notify the sender that the snap has been opened. Once we’ve been notified that a snap has been opened by all of its recipients, it is deleted from our servers. If a snap is still unopened after 30 days, it too is deleted from our servers.Deleting Snaps From the Recipient’s DeviceAfter a snap has been opened, the temporary copy of it is deleted from the device’s storage. We try to make this happen immediately, sometimes it might take a minute or two. The files are deleted by sending a “delete” instruction to the phone’s file system. This is the normal way that things are usually deleted on computers and phones—we don’t do anything special (like “wiping”).Extra DetailsWhile an unopened snap is being stored on the device, it’s not impossible to circumvent the Snapchat app and access the files directly. This isn’t something we support or encourage and in most cases it would involve jailbreaking or “rooting” the phone and voiding its warranty. If you’re trying to save a snap, it would be easier (and safer) to just take a screenshot or take a picture with another camera.Also, if you’ve ever tried to recover lost data after accidentally deleting a drive or maybe watched an episode of CSI, you might know that with the right forensic tools, it’s sometimes possible to retrieve data after it has been deleted. So… you know… keep that in mind before putting any state secrets in your selfies :)"},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/v4-phantom","date":"2012-12-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"Our Biggest Update Yet: v4.0 Phantom","text":"It’s been a busy couple of months at Snapchat. With over 50 million snaps shared every day, we’ve had to do a lot of work to make sure our service can continue to support a growing community of snappers. Today, we’re thrilled to announce a major update to our iPhone application – video snaps!Snapchat is all about sharing moments as they happen, and video is a great way to capture those moments. Unfortunately, with most camera applications, by the time you’ve switched from your still camera to your video camera and are ready to go, you’ve already missed the moment. It’s really frustrating. So we built something different – and we think it makes a lot more sense.Instead of toggling back and forth between a photo and a video setting, we’ve combined them into one button. If you want to take a photo, just tap the button. If you want to capture video, hold the button down. When you’re done recording, lift your finger. Super simple. Video snaps are up to ten seconds long, and like photo snaps, can only be viewed once in the application.But that’s not all – this update has a lot of great stuff. We’ve made capturing and sending faster with a full-screen preview, added landscape captions (just rotate your iDevice!) and there’s a new settings page to help you manage who can send you snaps.As always, we appreciate your feedback!

We sent and received all sorts of turkey snaps – raw turkeys on their way into the oven, silly turkey drawings, and steaming hot turkeys doused in cranberry sauce!Unfortunately, all of this excitement was not without a few hiccups. Our servers struggled to keep up with over one thousand snaps sent every second.We apologize if you weren’t able to send snaps with the normal speed and ease that we strive to provide every day, and we’re thankful for your continued support of our service.

With all of the different devices, each with different camera hardware, it’s tough to develop an app that works really well for every user. We started by rebuilding the camera layer from the ground up in OpenGL to make sure everyone could experience a fullscreen camera preview, even if it wasn’t natively supported on the device. Then we developed a new, ultrafast way to send images and load them in the feed, and combined that with a buttery smooth custom interface. We couldn’t be more excited to bring you a truly first-class Android app.A huge thank you to all of our fans for your support – we know waiting is never fun – and we really appreciate all of your encouraging emails, tweets, and facebook messages.

In our case, it took a village. We’re humbled and flattered by all the love and support we’ve received from the Snapchat community.We realize it’s a bit cliché, but this felt like a good time to share three ideas that really matter to us. These ideas will drive the decisions we make while developing Snapchat over the next year.We believe in sharing authentic moments with friends. It’s not all about fancy vacations, sushi dinners, or beautiful sunsets. Sometimes it’s an inside joke, a silly face, or greetings from a pet fish.Sharing those moments should be fun. Communication is more entertaining when it’s with the people who know us best. And we know that no one is better at making us laugh than our friends.There is value in the ephemeral. Great conversations are magical. That’s because they are shared, enjoyed, but not saved.Thank you again for all of your support."},{"platform":"Snapchat","url":"https://newsroom.snap.com/were-sorry","date":"2012-09-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"title":"We’re Sorry","text":"We’ve been working day and night to accommodate the massive increases in traffic on the Snapchat service and prepare for a major product update.
