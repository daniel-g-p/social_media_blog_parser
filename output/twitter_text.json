Instead of only entering a password to log in, 2FA requires you to also enter a code or use a security key. This additional step helps make sure that you, and only you, can access your account. To date, we have offered three methods of 2FA: text message, authentication app, and security key. While historically a popular form of 2FA, unfortunately we have seen phone-number based 2FA be used - and abused - by bad actors. So starting today, we will no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message/SMS method of 2FA unless they are Twitter Blue subscribers. The availability of text message 2FA for Twitter Blue may vary by country and carrier. Non-Twitter Blue subscribers that are already enrolled will have 30 days to disable this method and enroll in another. After 20 March 2023, we will no longer permit non-Twitter Blue subscribers to use text messages as a 2FA method. At that time, accounts with text message 2FA still enabled will have it disabled. Disabling text message 2FA does not automatically disassociate your phone number from your Twitter account. If you would like to do so, instructions to update your account phone number are available on our Help Center. We encourage non-Twitter Blue subscribers to consider using an authentication app or security key method instead. These methods require you to have physical possession of the authentication method and are a great way to ensure your account is secure.

This issue was addressed as of September 17, 2019, and today we want to reiterate the work we’ll continue to do to protect the privacy and security of the people who use Twitter. Keeping data secure and respecting privacy is something we take extremely seriously, and we have cooperated with the FTC every step of the way. In reaching this settlement, we have paid a $150M USD penalty, and we have aligned with the agency on operational updates and program enhancements to ensure that people’s personal data remains secure and their privacy protected. Twitter’s commitment to security and privacy is not a point-in-time exercise for us but a core value we constantly enhance by updating our practices to meet the evolving needs of our customers. The recently announced Data Governance Committee is an embodiment of our dedication to strengthen the implementation of our privacy and security policies and standards, as well as to expand our internal privacy and security review processes during the product development life cycle. Moving forward, we will continue to make investments in this work, including building and evolving processes, implementing technical measures, and conducting regular auditing and reporting to ensure we are mitigating risk at every level and function at Twitter. We will also continue to partner with the FTC, and our security and privacy regulators around the world, on our shared mission of building useful products and services that meet our customers’ needs while keeping the information they share with us secure and respectful of their privacy."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2022/celebrating-twitter-for-good","date":"2022-05-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Twitter for Good","Company"],"title":"Celebrating Twitter for Good","text":"Today, May 20, marks our 26th Twitter For Good Day, a company-wide biannual day when Tweeps around the world come together for the communities that we serve. Every day, the Twitter for Good team brings company and community together as a force for good through various partnerships and activations. However, on Twitter for Good Day, everyone at Twitter is encouraged to participate in activities that benefit their local communities. This year marks a return for many to in-person volunteering, something that was largely paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the pandemic, our teams were able to adapt and still hold four virtual Twitter for Good Days. Whether it’s training students in online safety and media literacy skills, serving meals and playing bingo with seniors, or conducting mock interviews with aspiring tech professionals, Twitter for Good Day is a chance to get out and learn about our neighbors and collectively make a difference where we live and work. Follow #TwitterForGood to see what’s happening around the world. Milestones for our employee matching program Today also marks a total of $10 million dollars donated through our employee matching program since its launch in August of 2018. Since its inception, the program has evolved significantly, including a ten-fold increase in the number of organizations we support. Tweeps have been especially successful at launching their own personal campaigns, raising dollars from friends and family to then use against our employee match. During major world events, we’ve also increased the number of dollars matched by Twitter, surging to match three times the amount donated during events of particular interest to Tweeps and in support of causes and organizations they care about. Thus far, our employees have donated to 3,318 organizations in 50 countries. Launching ArtHouse for Good ArtHouse, Twitter’s in-house content creation team for brands, and Twitter for Good have joined forces to launch ArtHouse for Good, a new social impact initiative that helps nonprofit organizations amplify their voice on Twitter. Over the past year, we’ve collaborated with partners around the world to elevate their content through pro bono, world-class creative content production and consultation. This includes editing and optimizing content, bringing in talented artists and creators, and providing strategic guidance around best practices on Twitter. We’ve also worked in lockstep with our creative colleagues on Twitter NEXT to bring these projects to life. Here are a few examples: Promoting environmental conservation with IPAM Amazoni We partnered with the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) to raise awareness of the deforestation crisis happening in the Amazon forest. The key element of the campaign was to create and introduce a new persona to the Twitter timeline: Maya. Maya was created as a new and innovative way to connect with audiences on Twitter through IPAM’s handle. Our team worked with activist, creator, and journalist Alice Pataxó to develop Maya’s voice and tone, and collaborated with creative agency, Clint Studio, to bring Maya to life through illustrations and artistry. Amplifying Dalit History Month with the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights For Dalit History Month in India, we worked with the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR) to showcase, highlight and support the presence and work of 5 key nonprofit partners from India focused on supporting marginalized communities and furthering their voices, both on and off the service. Optimized content that was produced for this campaign resulted in over 11 million impressions and over 500K Tweet engagements.¹ What’s next? At Twitter, we’re committed to uniting profit and purpose and harnessing the power of our company to strengthen healthy public conversation.

During periods of crisis – such as situations of armed conflict, public health emergencies, and large-scale natural disasters – access to credible, authoritative information and resources is all the more critical. Today, we’re introducing our crisis misinformation policy – a global policy that will guide our efforts to elevate credible, authoritative information, and will help to ensure viral misinformation isn’t amplified or recommended by us during crises. In times of crisis, misleading information can undermine public trust and cause further harm to already vulnerable communities. Alongside our existing work to make reliable information more accessible during crisis events, this new approach will help to slow the spread by us of the most visible, misleading content, particularly that which could lead to severe harms. Developing the policy Teams at Twitter have worked to develop a crisis misinformation framework since last year, drawing on key input from global experts and human rights organizations. For the purposes of this policy, we define crises as situations in which there is a widespread threat to life, physical safety, health, or basic subsistence. This definition is consistent with the United Nations’ definition of a humanitarian crisis and other humanitarian assessments. Down the line, as we expand our approach, we will enforce around other emergent global crises, informed by the United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)’s emergency response framework, and other global humanitarian frameworks. Addressing the most severe harms During moments of crisis, establishing whether something is true or false can be exceptionally challenging. To determine whether claims are misleading, we require verification from multiple credible, publicly available sources, including evidence from conflict monitoring groups, humanitarian organizations, open-source investigators, journalists, and more. Conversation moves quickly during periods of crisis, and content from accounts with wide reach are most likely to rack up views and engagement. To reduce potential harm, as soon as we have evidence that a claim may be misleading, we won’t amplify or recommend content that is covered by this policy across Twitter – including in the Home timeline, Search, and Explore. In addition, we will prioritize adding warning notices to highly visible Tweets and Tweets from high profile accounts, such as state-affiliated media accounts, verified, official government accounts. Some examples of Tweets that we may add a warning notice to include: False coverage or event reporting, or information that mischaracterizes conditions on the ground as a conflict evolves; False allegations regarding use of force, incursions on territorial sovereignty, or around the use of weapons; Demonstrably false or misleading allegations of war crimes or mass atrocities against specific populations; False information regarding international community response, sanctions, defensive actions, or humanitarian operations. Strong commentary, efforts to debunk or fact check, and personal anecdotes or first person accounts do not fall within the scope of the policy. What you’ll see on Twitter Tweets with content that violate the crisis misinformation policy will be placed behind a warning notice that looks like this: People on Twitter will be required to click through the warning notice to view the Tweet, and the content won’t be amplified or recommended across the service. In addition, Likes, Retweets, and Shares will be disabled, and the notice will link to more information about our approach to crisis misinformation. Content moderation is more than just leaving up or taking down content, and we’ve expanded the range of actions we may take to ensure they’re proportionate to the severity of the potential harm. We’ve found that not amplifying or recommending certain content, adding context through labels, and in severe cases, disabling engagement with the Tweets, are effective ways to mitigate harm, while still preserving speech and records of critical global events. While this first iteration is focused on international armed conflict, starting with the war in Ukraine, we plan to update and expand the policy to include additional forms of crisis. The policy will supplement our existing work deployed during other global crises, such as in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and India.

We have always understood that to reach this goal we must give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, instantly without barriers. Today, we are a new company embarking on a new chapter, but our steadfast commitment to this mission has not changed. In fact, we are better positioned to realize our ambitions than ever before. We’ve always understood that our business and revenue are interconnected with our mission; they rely on each other. Brand safety is only possible when human safety is the top priority. All of this remains true today. What has changed, however, is our approach to experimentation. As you’ve seen over the past several weeks, Twitter is embracing public testing. We believe that this open and transparent approach to innovation is healthy, as it enables us to move faster and gather user feedback in real-time. We believe that a service of this importance will benefit from feedback at scale, and that there is value in being open about our experiments and what we are learning. We do all of this work with one goal in mind: to improve Twitter for our customers, partners, and the people who use it across the world. As we carry out this work, we want to assure you of a few things: First, none of our policies have changed. Our approach to policy enforcement will rely more heavily on de-amplification of violative content: freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach. Our Trust & Safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules. The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse. When urgent events manifest on the platform, we ensure that all content moderators have the guidance they need to find and address violative content. As we improve our policies and processes, bad actors will also develop new methods of disruption. This is not new. Our team of experts is constantly adapting to identify and defuse threats, and we are proud of our early results: impressions on violative content are down over the past month, despite the growth in overall usage on the platform. Finally, as we embark on this new journey, we will make mistakes, we will learn, and we will also get things right. Throughout, we’ll communicate openly with our users and customers, to get and share your feedback as we build. We remain committed to providing a safe, inclusive, entertaining, and informative experience for everyone. We will continue to be transparent as we move through this transition period.

That’s why we created Twitter Circle, a new way to Tweet to a smaller crowd. With Twitter Circle, people now have the flexibility to choose who can see and engage with their content on a Tweet-by-Tweet basis. This makes it easier to have more intimate conversations and build closer connections with select followers. We began testing Twitter Circle in May, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. So starting today, we’re making this highly-requested feature available to everyone on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com globally. Take a look below to learn more about Twitter Circle, how it works, and what our community has to say about it. Before you post on Twitter, you’ll now see an option to share your Tweet with either your circle or your full followers list. Circles can contain up to 150 people, and you can adjust who’s in and who’s out at any time. Don’t worry, no one will be notified of any changes you make to your circle. Tweets sent to your circle will appear with a green badge underneath them. They can only be seen by those you’ve selected to be in your circle and cannot be Retweeted or shared. Additionally, all replies to these Tweets are private, even if your Twitter account is public. You can find more info about Twitter Circle here. We want to ensure everyone on Twitter has the choice, control, tools, and transparency to join the conversation how and when they want, and Twitter Circle is another important step in that direction. Giving people the option to share thoughts with a select group of followers helps make Tweeting more accessible. This is true whether you’re brand new to Twitter or you have millions of followers. Since the feature began testing, people have been sharing how it’s helped them personalize their Twitter experience, including: Feeling more comfortable Tweeting and expressing themselves Eliminating the need for alternate or secondary accounts Sharing content with a close and evolving group of friends Avoiding toggling between protected and public account settings I love Twitter Circle because we all have those Tweets that we don’t want the entire world to see so it’s nice to be able to have a space where we can share and laugh with the people we are in community with! Twitter Circle eliminates the fear of the wrong person seeing the wrong Tweet and has allowed me to connect more honestly and purposefully with my followers which is what Twitter is all about. Twitter Creator I love Twitter Circle because it allows you to curate a community within your community. Someone like me who has a larger platform can’t always be as open and connected with my friends the way I want to on Twitter, so this allows me to be able to connect with my broader audience, as well as my personal friends all on the same timeline! Twitter Creator Some results from our Twitter Circle test include: Increased overall Tweeting Increased Tweet engagement rate on circle Tweets (Likes and replies) Twitter is also committed to incorporating feedback from trusted partners and online safety experts, including the Twitter Trust & Safety Council, into the products and features we build. These groups regularly emphasize the importance of online customization tools in helping people express themselves freely online. LGBTQ+ youth often opt to creating separate private accounts to feel more comfortable sharing online with people who accept their sexual orientation or gender identity. Twitter Circle puts power into the hands of people on Twitter by creating a new way for them to control how they show up online and feel safe expressing themselves.

To do that, we’ve rolled out a series of products and initiatives designed to make credible information more accessible, provide real-time insights and context on important issues, highlight relevant conversations happening on Twitter, and more. Here are some of the things we’ve done to promote healthy and informed Twitter conversations in Brazil. Twitter has introduced a new “Eleições 2022” section in our Explore tab 🔎that’s regularly updated with the latest news and information related to the election. The tab is localized to include regional office races in 10 states across Brazil. For those who have Twitter notifications enabled, we send notices whenever an important moment or conversation around the election is taking place. We’ve also made it easier to identify candidates running for President, Vice-President, Senator, and Governor by including easily visible labels on the profile page of each candidate’s Twitter account. Twitter created our Civic Integrity Policy to prevent our service from being used to interfere in elections or other civic acts. It’s an additional layer of protection whose purpose is to ensure that the public debate taking place on Twitter doesn’t harm people’s right or ability to vote. This extra policy is applied for a limited period of time before, during, and after an election — an interval determined by consulting with civic integrity experts. With the Civic Integrity Policy in place in Brazil, Twitter will take measures in relation to content: Intended to intimidate people from participating in civic acts or to mislead them about how to take part in them That makes any false or misleading statements undermining public confidence in the election That intentionally indicates false or improper affiliation, own or of third parties, to candidates, parties and other institutions Depending on the severity of the violation, corrective measures may include tagging or removing the Tweet or even suspending the account. It’s important to note that this policy does not cover all types of political content. Its focus is on misleading information that may harm the progress, popular participation, and/or outcome of a democratic electoral process. To help people find answers to their most common questions about the elections, we teamed up with Politize!, a civil society organization focused on political education. Anyone who sends a Direct Message (DM) to @Politize! will receive information that helps answer questions about the 2022 elections, politics in general, tips on how to spot fake news and have healthy conversations, and suggestions for reliable data sources. We’ve also partnered with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to create a series of search prompts that appear as the first result of Twitter searches related to the election, among other initiatives. These prompts direct people to the TSE’s official and reliable information on things like electronic voting machines, voter registration cards, and more. We’re committed to expanding people’s access to reliable content related to the elections. That’s why we’re making “pre-bunk” Moments available — Tweets with credible information that are presented in Twitter’s Explore tab, Trends, and search area. Pre-bunks bring factual context to the most common misleading claims related to elections thanks to our collaboration with trusted national and regional partners, allowing us to preemptively inform people of potential misinformation that may be circulating during the electoral period. Twitter’s Curation team also provides “debunk” Moments to clarify, contrast, or contextualize misinformation narratives. Specific criteria are taken into account for both pre-bunks and debunks, including large volumes of conversations on a public health topic, electoral processes, or involving manipulated media. We know that the 2022 elections are important to Brazilians. The topic was Tweeted about more than 56 million times in the first eight months of 2022 alone. To help encourage people to engage in the conversation, Twitter has introduced a series of unique emojis around the elections in Brazil. These emojis appear whenever popular hashtags such as #Eleções2022, #VoteConsciente, and #ProjetoEleição are used. We’ll be adding in additional hashtag-prompted emojis around specific events such as debates and on election day itself. Healthy conversations are informed by reliable information. That’s why Twitter has been partnering with AFP, a leading global news agency, to help elevate credible news and information in Portuguese. The collaboration started as a pilot in 2021 and has recently been renewed for a one-year term. It specifically focuses on Brazil, enabling our Curation Team to increase the speed and scale of our efforts to add context to the wide range of global topics and conversations happening on Twitter. AFP has joined trusted news organizations Reuters and The Associated Press in working with Twitter to identify and elevate credible information. We then show this curated information to people in various locations throughout our service to give context to some of the most important and talked-about issues as they happen. These locations include: Trends The Explore tab Search Prompts Tweet labels For more on what we’re doing to encourage civic participation in Brazil, check out our Portuguese-language articles here and here."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2022/ttr-20","date":"2022-01-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Transparency","Company"],"title":"Sharing our latest transparency update, marking decade long commitment","text":"This year marks a decade of transparency reporting for Twitter, and today we are publishing our 20th Transparency Report. Why does this matter? Over the last 10 years how governments attempt to control free expression, remove content, and reveal the identity of account owners on Twitter has evolved significantly. Meaningful transparency helps people understand the rules of online services and hold governments accountable for their actions, and in turn, helps keep us accountable for principled content moderation and responsiveness to government demands. Transparency is a key guiding principle in our mission to serve the public conversation, protect the Open Internet, and advance the internet as a global force for good. We have and will continue to fight for the people who use Twitter to raise their voice. Highlights from our latest report We continue to see a concerning trend toward attempts to limit global press freedom, with an increase in government legal demands targeting journalists, as well as an overall increasing number of legal demands on accounts – both represent record highs since reporting began. Record number of legal demands on accounts (47,572 demands on 198,931 accounts) An increase of 103% in legal demands from governments targeting verified journalists and news outlets since the last reporting period The United States accounted for 20% of all global requests Tweet impressions that violated Twitter rules accounted for less than 0.1% of total impressions on all Tweets We objected to 29 US civil requests for account information that sought to unmask the identities of anonymous speakers See the full report here. Governments’ role in transparency reporting This update comes at a time when government requests for account information and content removal continually hit new records, including demands to reveal the identity of anonymous account owners. This is why we continue to advocate for greater transparency from governments themselves about how these powers are used. People who use our service should know that we take a principled approach to how we handle government requests and legal demands and how we share information about people who use our service. For July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (the reporting period of the update we’re sharing today) we saw an increase in global legal demands received, a continued upward trend for Twitter. For this reporting period, Twitter received 47,572 legal demands for 198,931 unique accounts, the largest number of accounts we’ve reported in the past 10 years. This number has continued to increase throughout each reporting period, and we also continue to see similar trends in government requests for information. This reporting period, we received 11,460 such requests. Globally during the latest reporting period: Twitter narrowed (meaning we disclosed some information but not all information demanded in the request) or did not disclose any information in response to 60% of global government information requests. For the latest reporting period, 349 accounts of verified journalists and news outlets located all around the world were subject to 326 legal demands, a 103% increase since the previous reporting period and a record high since we started tracking this important metric, which is all the more important at a time when freedom of the press is strained globally. From the US during the last reporting period: Government information requests originating from the US made up the highest percentage among requesting countries from around the world. With the exception of the second half of 2020, US information requests have represented the largest share of total global volume in a reporting period since Twitter’s first transparency report in 2012. 20% of all global requests for account information originated from the United States during this reporting period. These requests accounted for 39% of all accounts specified from around the world. Twitter complied, in whole or in part, with 69% of these U.S. information requests. We objected to 29 US civil requests for account information that sought to unmask the identities of anonymous speakers on First Amendment grounds. Of those 29 requests, we filed lawsuits to fight back in two instances and succeeded in convincing courts to apply First Amendment protections in one case. The other case remains pending. As in past reports, Twitter is not reporting on any other requests for information deemed to be related to national security processes because of limitations imposed on us by the U.S. government. We have been fighting for more transparency around this process for years, and continue to fight this issue in our court case, Twitter v. Garland, and are currently awaiting a decision on appeal. We strongly believe in providing data and information that is straightforward and provides insights into the types of requests we receive from governments and others around the world. To this end, we also upload legal requests directly into the Lumen Database, a project by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. We encourage the public to explore this site to get a sense of the day-to-day queries we receive from governments and other entities around the world. Investments in technology In 2012, we were the first social media company to publish a transparency report, and since then it has become an industry standard. Over the past decade, we have made significant investments and developed our reporting including more data, insights and metrics. Since we first reported data behind our enforcement of the Twitter Rules in 2018, we’ve significantly evolved our approach to how we detect and take down content that is against our rules. The biggest impact we’ve seen in this work is through our use of technology to proactively take down content quickly, oftentimes without that content ever needing to be reported by people on Twitter. We’re iterating on the way that we measure our effectiveness and have worked to move beyond the binary “leave up” or “take down” traditional approach to content moderation. For this reporting period, we required the removal of more than four million Tweets that violated the Twitter Rules. We also deploy less aggressive enforcement actions by labeling Tweets to add important context when the information shared doesn’t warrant Tweet deletion, and have improved the way we make certain questionable content from accounts you don’t follow don't appear in replies, search, or on your Home Timeline. In future transparency reporting, we aim to share details on these measures in more specific ways, eventually making this data core to our reporting. One way we measure the efficacy of our investments in technology is by sharing how many impressions violative Tweets received before they are removed. For this reporting period, impressions on these violative Tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of total impressions on all Tweets. Of the Tweets removed, 71% received fewer than 100 impressions prior to removal, with an additional 21% receiving between 100 and 1,000 impressions. These numbers have remained consistent since we first began reporting this data in 2020, even as the volume of rule-violating content we remove has generally trended upward — indicating that our efforts at proactive detection are keeping pace with changing behavior. We continue to invest heavily in improving both the speed and comprehensiveness of our detections. Getting better at tackling platform manipulation and spam As a result of continued investment in our approach and our ongoing efforts to disrupt spam attacks on our service, for this reporting period, our teams deployed a 2% increase in global anti-spam challenges compared to the last reporting period. When we detect suspicious levels of activity, accounts may be locked and prompted to provide additional information (e.g., a phone number) or to solve a reCAPTCHA. This nominal increase is related to ongoing efforts to disrupt spam attacks on our service. Further, during the second half of 2021, we received 6% more spam reports from people using Twitter compared to the previous reporting period. During the past 10 years, we’ve made significant investments — and seen significant progress — in how we detect and take action against spam and platform manipulation, and give people on Twitter more context in their experience. One such example is around automated accounts. Automated accounts can be a source of useful, entertaining, and relevant information on Twitter. We launched Automated Account Labels in September 2021 to make it easier for people to be able to identify these “good bots”. As of February 2022, all automated accounts globally have the option to self-identify. To view more on our work, check out this Tweet thread from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal: Transparency with our data From Twitter’s beginnings in 2006, our uniquely open and public APIs (application programming interfaces) – which, at a high level, are the way computer programs “talk” to each other so they can request and deliver information – have given researchers and developers the opportunity to tap into what is happening in the world. Twitter is the only major service to make public conversation data available via an API, for research purposes. Open access to public data is critical for advancing research objectives on a wide range of topics in a safe way that ensures public privacy is protected. It raises general awareness and understanding of the scale and nature of the challenges impacting public conversation online, and it also helps to keep services like Twitter accountable for our own response to these challenges. Additionally, throughout the pandemic, we launched a COVID-19 endpoint to empower public health research, and a new academic platform to encourage cutting-edge research using Twitter data. This is one of the reasons you hear more about reports featuring Twitter as core to the research methodology — we intentionally empower this. What’s next? Transparency is key to building and sustaining trust, improving accountability, and preserving a free and secure Open Internet. People should understand the rules of online services and the way that governmental legal powers are used. Without transparency, there can be no accountability. For our part, Twitter aims to continually evaluate and improve the way we share information with the public. This year, we are launching the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC). Through the Consortium, Twitter shares large-scale datasets concerning platform moderation issues with a global group of public interest researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs and journalism studying platform governance issues. This program will initially focus on sharing data about accounts and networks Twitter has removed in connection with platform manipulation and state-backed information operations, enabling credible, reputable academics and researchers to find insights in and contextualize the data. While the way that we have reported this information has continually developed and improved over the past 10 years, our commitment to protecting the people who use Twitter remains unchanged. That includes protecting activists and journalists, accounts that wish to remain anonymous, and those who speak up against their own governments.

Now we’re expanding the scope of our work with AFP to include Spanish-language content curation in LATAM, Spain, and the US. With the help of AFP, our Curation Team is now able to better scale and provide informative context on timely topics being discussed on Twitter in Spanish. We can also detect topics that are generating widespread interest in a more proactive way, including those that could potentially generate misleading information. Just like our content curated by other trusted news agencies such as Reuters and The Associated Press, the content curated by AFP teams Latin America (AFP Factual for Spanish and AFP Checamos for Portuguese) is visible in the form of Moments that appear in various places throughout Twitter. These include: Trends Explore tab Search Prompts Tweet labels Another way we address misinformation via our Curation program is by publishing “debunks” relevant to the main misleading narratives circulating on Twitter. According to internal data, more than 9 million people per day come across at least one of these debunks while navigating our service. You may also see the information in Tweets posted by AFP or our other trusted curation partners. Our goal is to help people on Twitter easily access credible, contextualized information and make informed decisions about the content they choose to engage with. The expanded collaboration with AFP is the latest in a series of ongoing efforts to help bring us closer to that goal. Earlier this month, we announced that the visibility of Birdwatch notes was expanding to everyone in the US. These notes are written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter, to add helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way.

Registering a notable 16% increase in Tweet volume globally, #KpopTwitter conversations became more diverse and vibrant in 2021. Diving deeper into the flurry of Tweets, Twitter’s analysis reveals the Top 20 countries Tweeting most about K-pop, the Top 20 countries with the most K-pop fans, as well as rankings of the most Tweeted about K-pop artists and rising K-pop artists. With its legion of passionate and active fans, Indonesia tops the list for most number of K-pop Tweets for the second consecutive year. Meanwhile, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, the United States, Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil, India, and Japan made it into the top 10. While the list of countries with the most number of fans (analyzed by unique authors) looks similar to the list for most number of Tweets, with Indonesia coming in first and the others like Japan and the Philippines close behind, countries like Peru, Colombia, Singapore, and Ecuador were featured among the top 20 this year (after missing out in 2020). Meanwhile, as the number of fans continues to grow in various countries, Chile and Vietnam climbed the ranks by four and five positions, ultimately securing the 16th and 13th spots respectively. Of course, the 21st century pop icon, BTS (@BTS_twt), takes the top spot as the most Tweeted about K-pop artist globally - with the band’s concert ‘BTS PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE - LA’ alone contributing more than 68 million Tweets from all over the world. For the second year in a row, NCT (@NCTsmtown) comes in second. In addition to K-pop sensation BLACKPINK (@BLACKPINK) and heavyweights EXO (@weareoneEXO) being featured on the top 20 list, younger groups also cemented their positions with TOMORROW X TOGETHER (@TXT_members) rising from 8th place in 2020 to 6th in 2021, ATEEZ (@ATEEZofficial) climbing one spot to 9th, and Stray Kids (@Stray_Kids) at 10th. 2021 also proved to be a breakthrough year for the 4th generation of K-pop idols. ENHYPEN (@ENHYPEN_members) who were 5th on the 2020 list of rising K-pop artists impressively came in as the 3rd most Tweeted about band in 2021 (just after BTS and NCT). Within a year of their debut, the group celebrated a huge achievement with their first studio album “DIMENSION:DILEMMA” becoming a ‘million-seller’ and placing 11th on the Billboard 200 chart. Fellow 4th generation idols aespa (@aespa_official) and ITZY (@ITZYofficial) also hit significant milestones as they first entered the top 20 list, being 14th and 16th respectively. Other K-pop idols on the top 20 list include TREASURE (@treasuremembers), SEVENTEEN (@pledis_17), TWICE (@JYPETWICE), GOT7 (@GOT7Official), THE BOYZ (@IST_THEBOYZ), iKON (@YG_iKONIC), ASTRO (@offclASTRO), MonstaX (@OfficialMonstaX), Red Velvet (@RVsmtown), and SHINee(@SHINee). Unsurprisingly ENHYPEN (@ENHYPEN_members) is first on the list of the Top 10 rising Artists, followed by TOMORROW X TOGETHER (@TXT_members), TREASURE (@treasuremembers), aespa (@aespa_official), and ITZY (@ITZYofficial). Newer generation groups like IVE (@IVEstarship), CRAVITY (@CRAVITYstarship), WEi (@WEi__Official), ONEUS (@official_ONEUS), and CIX (@CIX_twt) are also featured on the Top 10. 2021 saw growing global interest in Korean entertainment beyond music While the reach of K-pop continued to skyrocket, we also saw a variety of conversations as Korean dramas, movies, webtoons, and other types of entertainment steadily cemented their place on the world stage. In particular, webtoons turned K-dramas were embraced by the global audience, with True Beauty, Sweet Home, and Navillera among the top most Tweeted about webtoons on Twitter. Of course, the influence of K-pop also had a part to play. When official soundtracks included famous K-pop artists, dramas and webtoons enjoyed a boost in viewership - such as BTS V’s song ‘Sweet Night’ for Itaewon Class. As the place to be for both fans and artists to connect, Twitter is a home for many celebrities from the different facets of Korean entertainment. In addition to well-known rapper Youngji (@dokgodieinsaeng) and actress Lee SeYoung (@seyoung0703), stars from the hit show Street Woman Fighter such as Monika (@monikaaashin), Honey J (@__honey_j__), and no:ze (@noze_world) started new Twitter accounts in the second half of 2021. Fans enjoyed more #OnlyOnTwitter content connecting themselves closely to stars Twitter continues to launch new features and programs that deliver #OnlyOnTwitter content to fans everywhere. Beyond providing support to the K-pop community, Twitter is also expanding our capabilities and evolving into a service to promote K-content. We have already hosted #TwitterBlueroom live sessions for movies and dramas including Q&As with the cast of The Book of Fish, King Maker, The Red Sleeve, and One Ordinary Day. Twitter also brought #FanTweets and #BehindTheTweets to K-pop starting with BLACKPINK’s ROSÉ. With the introduction of Twitter Spaces in 2021, Twitter has also created more opportunities and channels for fans and artists to connect and communicate, building stronger relationships with each other. Twitter’s Head of Global K-pop Partnerships, YeonJeong Kim says, “In 2021, with BTS and NCT leading the conversation, we could also see an increase in conversation related to rising artists such as ENHYPEN, aespa, and ITZY. But beyond K-pop, we’ve also seen discussions about Korean content across the board on Twitter growing with K-pop fans talking about not just their favorite music, performances, concerts, and daily lives, but showing increasing interest in dramas and webtoons with K-pop soundtracks or starring K-pop idols. As the global consumption of Korean content grows, we look forward to seeing even more diverse conversations on Twitter and providing more content you can see #OnlyOnTwitter in 2022.”"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2022/designing-accessible-sounds-story-behind-our-new-chirps","date":"2022-01-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Accessibility","Product"],"title":"Designing accessible sounds: The story behind our new chirps","text":"You may have noticed some new sounds on Twitter recently — things like the “chirps” you hear when refreshing your home timeline or requesting to speak in a Twitter Space. There’s a reason for that. As we work to improve the accessibility of our service, we’re updating Twitter’s sounds to help make them pleasing to more people, including those with sensory sensitivities. Here’s a quick look at what’s going on. Designing new, more accessible sounds requires disability representation throughout the design process. Thankfully, we’ve had a lot of help. Our neurodiverse team started by conducting research interviews and usability testing with people who self-identified as neurodivergent to better understand what kinds of sounds do and do not trigger sensory sensitivities. Guided by their input, we got to work with the audio experts at Listen creating a growing collection of new Twitter sounds designed to meet the following criteria: Promoting accessibility for those with sensory sensitivities Blending the organic and digital Keeping sounds short and smooth Attracting attention without being distracting You can check some of them out for yourself below. We’re happy to say that the first batch of new sounds for timeline refreshes and Twitter Spaces are now available globally on iOS and Android devices. Our design team is also working on additional audio updates for things like when you send a new Tweet or get a notification, so keep your ears open for more new sounds to come! Of course, try as we might, not all sounds are for everyone. If you prefer a silent Twitter experience, you can toggle sound effects on and off by following these steps: On iOS: Settings and Privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Display and Sound.

With podcasts, we’re taking that connection to a whole new level. Starting Thursday, August 25, we’re integrating podcasts into Twitter as a part of our newly redesigned Spaces Tab. We know that some discussions need more than 280 characters, and bringing people closer to the ideas, content, and creators they know and love is core to Twitter no matter where the conversations take place. So how will it all work, and how can you check out Twitter’s new podcasts for yourself? Take a look below for everything you need to know about this exciting update. Integrating podcasts into Spaces, where audio conversations happen on Twitter, is another way we’re continuing to invest in audio creators. To do this in a simple and intuitive way that allows listeners to simply hit play and go, we started with a redesigned audio experience in the Spaces Tab. This redesign introduces personalized hubs that group audio content together by specific themes like News, Music, Sports, and more. Now Twitter listeners will be able to easily access a more personalized selection of live and recorded Spaces discussing the topics that are most relevant to them. But the selection doesn’t stop there. These new hubs will also feature the most popular and engaging podcasts from around the world. Our internal research indicates that 45% of people who use Twitter in the US also listen to podcasts monthly, so we’ll automatically suggest compelling podcasts to help people easily find and listen to the topics they want to hear more about. For example, if someone regularly interacts with Vox content on Twitter, they’ll probably see a Vox podcast in a Spaces hub. “Vox Media has a rich array of popular podcasts across many categories, and we’re thrilled that Twitter is expanding its audio capabilities to help more listeners discover them,” said Ray Chao, general manager of audio at Vox Media. “Whether it's Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway’s ‘Pivot,’ our daily news explainer ‘Today, Explained,’ or ‘Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara,' we're excited Twitter is offering users and podcast fans an exciting new frontier.\" Want to build a more customized experience? Just give a podcast a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” to let us know if the content is more or less interesting to you. From Spaces and podcasts to newsletters and Notes, we’re working every day to improve the way people connect with creators and make Twitter the home of the most engaging conversations in the world. Starting today, the reimagined Spaces Tab, including the addition of podcasts, will be visible to a group of global English-speaking audience on iOS and Android. Share your feedback with us to help us get it right, and keep your eyes (and ears) here for more announcements and feature releases designed to help you enjoy Twitter on your own terms."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/transparency-19","date":"2022-01-24T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Transparency","Company"],"title":"An update to the Twitter Transparency Center","text":"Trust in the information we consume every day is critical to how we engage online. Trust in information found online can be established and enhanced when companies, civil society and regulators are transparent about the data and processes they rely on. This, alongside thoughtful policies developed by governments around the world, can help elevate many of the core principles of the Open Internet. For our part, since 2012 we have consistently published bi-annual updates, detailing our enforcement actions housed in the Twitter Transparency Center. Coupled with this, we have been explicit in our advocacy for an Open Internet that is global, available to all, built on open standards and rooted in the protection of human rights. As we’ve said, protecting the Open Internet — which continues to be under threat — requires meaningful transparency, which is essential to holding companies and governments to account. This work is core to who we are as a company – connecting back to the very first Twitter Transparency Report in 2012, one of the first such reports in the industry. We’re facing unprecedented challenges as governments around the world increasingly attempt to intervene and remove content. This threat to privacy and freedom of expression is a deeply worrying trend that requires our full attention. Today’s update to the Twitter Transparency Center highlights our long-standing commitment to meaningful transparency and the pressing, urgent need to defend the free, secure, and global Open Internet. Sinéad McSweeney VP of Global Public Policy and Philanthropy Today, we continue to build on our commitment to sharing meaningful insights about the work we do through the publication of the latest update to our Twitter Transparency Center, including relevant data from January 1, 2021, through June 30, 2021. Information and removal requests As important regulatory discussions take place across the globe, we believe it is crucial for citizens to be aware of the requests made by their governments. Throughout this reporting period, Twitter continued to receive requests from governments for account information and account preservations. Government preservation requests (requests to preserve account information) decreased by 4% from our most recent publication, with the United States accounting for 57% of all global preservation requests. In a change from our last reporting period, the United States became the single largest source of government information requests with 3,026 requests, accounting for 24% of the global volume we received during this period. These requests accounted for 27% of all accounts specified from around the world and Twitter complied, in whole or in part, with 68% of these U.S. information requests. Twitter partially disclosed or did not disclose information in response to 64% of global government information requests, a decrease of 9% during this reporting period, under our guidelines for requesting information. As of this reporting period, Twitter has now received non-government information requests from 35 different countries since 2014, including Argentina, Israel, and Switzerland, which appeared in this report for the first time. These requests come from third parties seeking account information from Twitter, for example, as non-parties in a civil action, or on behalf of defendants in criminal cases. Japan, Brazil, and the United States were the top three requesting countries when it comes to non-government requests, with all three accounting for 89% of all requests and 87% of the total accounts specified for this period. In terms of legal demands from governments, in the six month period covered in this report, Twitter received 43,387 legal demands to remove content, specifying 196,878 accounts. This is the largest number of accounts ever subject to removal requests in a reporting period since releasing our first transparency report in 2012. Of the total global volume of legal demands, 95% originated from only five countries (in decreasing order): Japan, Russia, Turkey, India, and South Korea. We withheld or required account holders to remove some or all of the reported content in response to 54% of these global legal demands. Enforcement of the Twitter Rules Twitter required account holders to remove 4.7M Tweets that violated the Twitter Rules. Of the Tweets removed, 68% received fewer than 100 impressions prior to removal, with an additional 24% receiving between 100 and 1,000 impressions. In total, impressions on these violative Tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of all impressions for all Tweets during that time period. In these six months, Twitter permanently suspended 453,754 unique accounts for violations of our child sexual exploitation (CSE) policy — 89% of those accounts were proactively identified and removed by deploying a range of internal tools and/or by utilizing the industry hash sharing (e.g., PhotoDNA) prior to any reports filed via the designated CSE reporting channel. In the first half of 2021, Twitter suspended 44,974 unique accounts for promotion of terrorism and violent organizations — 93% of those accounts were proactively identified and removed. Broadly, Twitter continues to see an overall downward trend in the number of violating accounts which is likely due to changing behaviors of these actors coupled with continued improvements of our defenses in this area. As the Open Internet continues to be under threat around the world, we will continue our advocacy and build on our work to increase meaningful transparency and accountability in the industry — with the Twitter Transparency Center as our single source of truth in this space.

In 2018, this commitment led us to publish the first comprehensive public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Then, earlier this year, we launched the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) — a global group of experts studying platform governance issues. These combined efforts have given tens of thousands of researchers access to 52 datasets spanning nine terabytes of media and more than 220 million Tweets, all with one goal in mind: empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter. Now we want to take it a step further. That’s why, starting today, we’re offering researchers the opportunity to apply for membership in the TMRC. Membership in the TMRC is open to global researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism. Our goal is simple: prioritize transparency by sharing more data on more issues to those who are studying content moderation. We developed our application process in consultation with members of our Trust & Safety Council and other global experts. You can learn more about the Consortium here or review eligibility criteria and apply for membership here. Over the years, we’ve learned and shared a lot about the importance of combating manipulation and interference in political conversations on Twitter. By providing academics and researchers with access to specific, granular data (not just aggregated reports), we enable them to find insights and contextualize information in a way that increases the visibility of the reports themselves. For example, earlier this year we shared data from about 15 information operations as a pilot for the TMRC. This data has already enabled critical, independent research by TMRC’s partners at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Cazadores de Fake News, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. We’ll continue to share platform manipulation campaigns and information operations with the Consortium, in line with our platform manipulation and spam policy. This includes sharing data with TMRC researchers about the networks we remove and technical information about the presumptive country of origin of information operations. However, as we’ve said previously, we'll no longer share our own attribution information for these datasets. Our goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. Over time, we intend to share similarly comprehensive datasets about other content moderation policy areas and enforcement decisions, such as data about Tweets labeled under our misinformation policies."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2022/accelerating-our-climate-commitments-on-earth-day","date":"2022-01-21T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Transparency","Twitter for Good","Company"],"title":"Accelerating our climate commitments on Earth Day","text":"This month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a new and alarming report, underscoring the urgency of the climate crisis – “immediate and deep emissions reductions,” they wrote, are necessary to turn the tide on global warming. Now more than ever, meaningful climate action, from all of us, is critical. Today – on #EarthDay2022 – we’re sharing more about our work to serve the climate conversations happening across Twitter, plus the latest on our own sustainability commitments. Climate-forward approach to ads People around the world use Twitter to connect with others passionate about protecting our planet. Last year, we introduced a dedicated Topic to help people find personalized conversations about climate change. And, to support conversation around #COP26, we rolled out pre-bunks — hubs of credible, authoritative information across a range of key themes, like the science backing climate change, made available in the Explore tab, Search, and Trends. To better serve these conversations, misleading advertisements on Twitter that contradict the scientific consensus on climate change are prohibited, in line with our inappropriate content policy. We believe that climate denialism shouldn’t be monetized on Twitter, and that misrepresentative ads shouldn’t detract from important conversations about the climate crisis. This approach is informed by authoritative sources, like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports. We recognize that misleading information about climate change can undermine efforts to protect the planet. In the coming months, we’ll have more to share on our work to add reliable, authoritative context to the climate conversations happening on Twitter. Sustainability at Twitter We continue to accelerate our sustainability efforts, and we’re laser focused on reducing our own carbon footprint. Through targeted work, we’ve lowered our emissions for the second straight year – even as the company grew. In 2019, we shared plans to achieve 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. With the help of our partners at Watershed, we’ll be utilizing zero-carbon electricity for all of our data centers, and for surrounding offices in the US and Canada. Our Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are sourced from solar and wind power projects in the same geographic region in which energy was used, and cover 100% of Scope 2 emissions from these sites. Earlier this year, we joined the EU climate pact, committing to ambitious North Star and Pathway pledges, in line with Paris Agreement goals. We’re committed to transitioning to renewable electricity in all our EU leased operations; using 100% carbon-neutral energy in our directly leased buildings by 2025; and upping our investments in carbon removal technologies. In 2021, we were proud to join the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), and we’re actively pursuing those targets. By 2030, we’re set to have significantly reduced our greenhouse gas emissions, paving the way for our net-zero journey. Since 2020, we’ve measurably advanced our CDP score, achieving a B grade for our comprehensive reporting on Twitter’s sustainability efforts. We believe that transparency should be central to our approach to sustainability. We’ll continue to report on our progress, providing regular, public-facing updates against our declared targets. Climate community Tackling the climate crisis requires meaningful, sustained collaboration. Through #AdsForGood grants, on-service support, trainings, and more, we’re partnering with organizations committed to environmental conservation and sustainability. These include Earth Day Network, United Nations (UN) Environment Programme, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UN Development Programme, Greenpeace, Voice for the Planet, Let Me Breathe, WWF, 350.org, FridaysForFuture, We Don’t Have Time, Climate Reality Project, and others. What people are saying The climate conversation happening on Twitter is ever-expanding and uniquely global. Since 2021, conversation about sustainability has grown by more than 150%. We’ve seen a 60%+ increase in terms like “restoring” and “rebalancing.” Discussion around waste reduction has increased by over 100%, and decarbonization by more than 50%. We know that protecting the environment is something that people on Twitter care about, and we’re always thinking about other ways to serve these conversations. How to get involved We all have a part we can play in tackling this urgent, global crisis. From volunteering with an environmental organization in your community, to joining a Twitter Space with environmental experts, to learning more about protecting our planet, there are lots of ways to get involved. We encourage you to Tweet along with the #EarthDay2022 conversation happening on Twitter and follow the Climate Change Topic for more."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2022/meme-is-born-how-people-are-taking-mixed-media-viral-twitter","date":"2022-01-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights","Product"],"title":"A meme is born: How people are taking mixed media viral on Twitter","text":"Full disclosure: when Twitter releases a new feature into the wild, we don’t know exactly how people are going to use it. It’s true. Sure, we have an idea. Usually it’s a pretty good idea. But we can only ever give people what amounts to a new canvas to work with. They (and you) are the ones who ultimately get to decide what goes on it. That’s the beauty of a public conversation that’s open to everyone — it leaves plenty of room for surprises and creativity. And there may be no better example of this than mixed media, a new feature that lets people mix and match up to 4 images, videos, and GIFs in a single Tweet. Almost immediately after we announced the global release of mixed media in early October, people on Twitter got to work creating things like side-by-side reactions using one photo and one video or four-panel memes composed of three images and either a video or a GIF. To see this in action, look no further than (of all things) the revived “Pope Francis Holding Things” meme that dates all the way back to 2013. Who saw that coming? Of course, it’s not just one kind of mixed media meme (mixed meme-ia?) that’s getting all the attention. People, creators, and brands on Twitter are experimenting with the feature in a variety of clever ways to rack up millions of views and engagements. For brands that rely on Twitter to express a more witty and playful side, mixed media provides another way to jump on existing trends and even create new ones. And honestly, we’re absolutely loving it.

Every day, more than 30 million Tweets are published about music around the world. That’s more than 20,000 every minute. A couple thousand have probably even been added since you started reading this article. In honor of Taylor Swift’s massively anticipated Midnights album, we thought we’d give you a peek under the hood at the different ways music fans (like “Swifties”) show up on Twitter for their favorite artists. And scroll down for updated numbers on how \"Swifties\" have responded to Midnights on Twitter. There’s a kind of poetic logic to examining music on Twitter through a “Taylor Swift” lens. We’ve quite literally grown up together — her self-titled debut album was released in 2006, the same year Twitter was created. Since 2010, Taylor Swift has been mentioned in 329 million Tweets. That’s an average of more than 75,114 Tweets every day for the past, oh, 4,380 days. In fact, when Red (Taylor’s Version) was released in November 2021, there were more Tweets about Taylor Swift than about football and basketball combined. 😳😳😳 Swifties are loud and proud on Twitter, too. The word “Swiftie” or “Swifties” has been Tweeted more than 18 million times over the past 12 years, usually accompanied by emojis like the red scarf (🧣) which saw a 25x increase in use on the day All Too Well (Taylor’s Version) was released. Speaking of All Too Well (Taylor’s Version), since 2019 it’s the most Tweeted about Taylor Swift song alongside Love Story (Taylor’s Version) and Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version). The response to Midnights from fans on Twitter has been, well, swift. Since the album's release, there have been about 5 million Tweets about it, and nearly 4 million of those were published by the end of October 22. To put that in some perspective, Taylor Swift generated 2x more Tweet volume than NFL football on Thursday, October 20! Fans can't get enough of three songs in particular: Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, and Snow on the Beach, which make up the Top 3 most Tweeted-about songs since the release of Midnights. And there's lots of love to go around for Taylor's collaborators, as well. Mentions of Jack Antonoff, for example, grew 14x compared to the day before the album release! It’s true: music is the largest community on Twitter. With 441 million unique followers, people are more likely to follow a music-related account than any other type of account on Twitter. It’s no surprise, then, that major music releases tend to be top events on Twitter. Take Harry Styles, whose Harry’s House album was Tweeted about more than 10 million times around the time of its release in May 2022. The conversation around music spikes on Fridays, when new albums usually drop. So what will the conversation look like this Friday when Midnights is finally released?

Recommendations are one of the ways we do that. If you’ve ever seen a Tweet you enjoyed from someone you didn’t follow, you’ve probably seen a recommendation. Think of them as personalized suggestions that are shown to you based on actions you take on Twitter. Recommendations are designed to enrich your Twitter experience, and the more you know about them, the better they can be. In fact, we’ve put together a whole Help Center article detailing what types of content we recommend, where recommendations appear, and how you can control them (definitely worth a read). If you’re pressed for time, however, here’s the tl;dr on recommendations and how we’re working to improve them. The content we recommend to you is informed by actions you take on Twitter, also known as signals. Signals can include things like interests you’ve told us about, Topics you follow, Tweets you engage with, and even Tweets people in your network like. Based on these signals and more, we’ll show you content we think you’ll be interested in. Recommendations can appear in your Home timeline, certain places within the Explore tab, and elsewhere on Twitter. Because recommended content doesn’t always come from people and accounts you follow, we work to surface conversations that are relevant, healthy, and authentic. Our recommendations team partners closely with our Health, Trust & Safety, and Machine Learning Ethics teams to make sure we’re recommending high-quality content. You can read more about our standards for recommendations in the Help Center article linked above. In addition to improving the quality of our recommendations, we also provide tools to manage recommendations and clear ways to tell us when we do and don’t get it right. This is an important part of enabling you to use Twitter on your own terms. One of these options is the “sparkle icon” ✨ located at the top right corner of your Home timeline. This lets you toggle between seeing top \"For You\" Tweets, which include recommendations from accounts and Topics you don’t follow, and \"Latest\" Tweets from only the accounts you do follow. You can also give us feedback on recommendations you see on your Home timeline. For example, liking or Retweeting recommended content will send us a signal that you find it interesting. Selecting “Not interested in this Tweet/Topic” from the Tweet menu, on the other hand, will tell us you’d like to see less of that type of content. Finding Tweets and accounts you like should feel effortless. That’s why we’re investing in improving the quality of recommendations across Twitter and continuing to explore ways to make them easier to understand and control. This includes a new design with an “X” on Tweets making it simple to remove them from your Home timeline and share your feedback with us. We’re also testing new ways to clearly distinguish and switch between your “For You” Home timeline view that includes recommendations and the “Latest” view that doesn’t. With millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we’re also testing new ways for people who are new to our service to tell us more about what they’re interested in. This way we can easily recommend content, accounts, and Topics you truly want to see. We’ll continue working to improve the way you discover timely and interesting content on Twitter, and we’ll keep sharing our progress with you along the way."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2022/making-images-twitter-more-accessible","date":"2022-01-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product","Accessibility"],"title":"We’re making images on Twitter more accessible. Here’s how","text":"Not everyone experiences Twitter in the same way. For those who are blind or have low vision, image descriptions are an important tool for clarifying and enriching their experience. That’s why we’re rolling out a new image description reminder to encourage more people on Twitter to add helpful descriptions to the images they Tweet. Here’s how it works — and why it’s important. Whenever you add a photo to a Tweet, you have the option to describe it using alt text, also known as a digital image description. Our new image description reminder is a feature that prompts you to make a good habit of adding alt text to every image you upload and share on Twitter. Once enabled, the feature sends you a prompt on web and mobile reminding you to add alt text whenever you’re about to Tweet an image. We’re rolling out our new image description reminder globally, and most people on Twitter have access to it already (those who don’t will have it very soon). To activate it, open the main menu and select: Settings and privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Accessibility > Receive image description reminder Adding descriptions to an image helps create a more inclusive experience for everyone on Twitter. The descriptions are useful not only to people using screen readers, but to those in low-bandwidth areas, those with web phones, and anyone who wants to learn more about an image. Image descriptions help describe the image to people who aren’t able to view it, so it’s important to keep the text focused: capture what’s important, be succinct, and be objective. For example, if you’re Tweeting a photo of your favorite beach, you can write: “An empty beach at sunset with red, orange, purple, and blue colors in a cloudless sky. Palm trees are visible in the foreground.” You can read more about how to write great image descriptions. Photos with descriptions appear with an ALT badge in the lower left corner, making it clear that additional descriptive text is available for the image. Similar to Tweet text translations, Twitter translates image descriptions to allow people from around the world to benefit from image descriptions. Our new image description reminder is part of our continuing efforts to make the public conversation more accessible to everyone. Other work we’ve done recently includes adding an ALT badge, a Closed Captions toggle button, and captions for audio conversations on Spaces and Voice Tweets. This work is made possible by our Accessibility Experience Team that works within our product organization on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on Twitter. In addition to the Accessibility Experience Team, Twitter has also created an Accessibility Center for Excellence whose role it is to consult and partner with teams across the company to ensure that everything from our legal and policy standards to our marketing strategies and office spaces are more accessible. You can learn more about how we’re making Twitter more accessible by following @TwitterA11y, or Tweet your first image using an image description."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2022/inclusion-diversity-equity-accessibility-report-our-global-approach-april-2022","date":"2022-01-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility Q1 2022: Our Global Approach","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2022/moments-that-defined-record-breaking-summer-twitter","date":"2022-01-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights","Sports","Movies","Music","Events"],"title":"Moments that defined a record-breaking summer on Twitter","text":"Some of the biggest moments from around the world are discussed on Twitter. From long awaited movie and album releases to sports highlights and global events that shape the course of history, Twitter is where people come to share and talk about the moments that impact them the most. And the summer of 2022 has been no different. September has already set the record for the biggest day in Twitter’s history, but there’s much more to a record-breaking summer than just 24 hours. Take a look below at just a few of the moments that helped define the summer of 2022 on Twitter. In late July, a one word Tweet from Beyoncé — “RENAISSANCE…” — drove more than 6.1 million video views and sent people across Twitter scrambling to listen to “Queen Bey’s” newest album. K-pop superstars BLACKPINK dropped the teaser for their hit single Pink Venom on Twitter on August 17, racking up more than 300,000 likes and nearly 4 million views. And who could forget BTS’ Jung Kook showing millions of viewers on Twitter how he likes to groove on his 25th birthday? When Thai actors/models Bright Vachirawit and Win Metawin touched down in Singapore on July 13 for the Burberry TB Summer Monogram Takeover event, Twitter lit up with more than 1.8 million Tweets talking about them. Just ten days later, Marvel’s WAKANDA FOREVER Tweet, with its official teaser set to a modern version of Bob Marley’s No Woman, No Cry, made millions of people around the world watch and ask: who is the next Black Panther? The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade sparked strong debate on Twitter surrounding important issues like health, politics, and women’s rights. More than 10 million Tweets about these subjects were posted on June 24, the day of the court’s ruling. Then on September 8, the world learned via the Royal Family’s official Twitter account that Queen Elizabeth II, the UK’s longest reigning monarch, died peacefully in her home at Balmoral. The Twitter world celebrated Lionel Messi’s 35th birthday in style on June 24 with more than 600,000 Tweets mentioning the Argentine soccer (football) superstar. And speaking of “the beautiful game”, Brazil’s Campeonato Brasileiro was Tweeted about more than 12 million times throughout the summer. Avaí vs Flamengo’s July 24 match alone saw nearly 800,000 conversations on Twitter. In Dubai, the 2022 Asia Cup prompted a surge in Tweets about cricket: more than 1.4 million on August 28 when Pakistan and India squared off, and more than 1.5 million 11 days later when Virat Kohli scored his 71st international 100 in India’s match against Afghanistan. And of course, in early September during the US Open tennis tournament, Serena Williams cemented her legacy both on the court and as the most Tweeted about female athlete ever. These are just a few of the incredible Twitter moments that have helped make the summer of 2022 so memorable. We can’t wait to see what you’ll talk about next.

More on our approach in English, Ukrainian, and Russian Like so many around the world, we’re disturbed and deeply saddened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis unfolding there. Our top priority is to promote the safety of people on and off the service, and our teams are working diligently to that end. We believe we have a responsibility to the public – particularly during periods of crisis – to proactively enforce our rules, preserve access to Twitter, elevate credible and reliable information, protect the privacy and safety of the people who use our service and others, and guard against efforts to manipulate the public conversation. Over the past several weeks, people in Ukraine, Russia, and around the world have used Twitter to share critical information in real-time, locate support, connect with one another, and raise their voices. Unfortunately, we are also aware that Twitter is being restricted for some people in Russia. As we’ve said previously, we believe that a free and open internet is vital, and that people around the world should have the same access to information. We take our collective role, and the role of our service, seriously. Below, we’re sharing updates to our approach and more detailed information about our efforts. Elevating reliable information Given the important role that algorithms play in recommending and amplifying content online, we believe that content moderation must extend beyond the leave-up-take-down binary. Our approach is two-fold: If content is in violation of the Twitter Rules, we’ll take enforcement action against it at the Tweet or account level – this includes content removal. When the risks for immediate harm associated with a Tweet are less severe, but where left uncontextualized may mislead people, we focus on reducing its reach and not proactively amplifying the Tweets into peoples’ timelines. De-amplifying content significantly reduces its visibility and labels add important context. From Home Timeline to Explore, we’re making it easier to find reliable updates and information and enhance safety. Our curated Twitter Moments about the war in Ukraine share real-time news and resources in multiple languages, and since the beginning of the conflict, the moments have had more than 38.6 billion impressions.** Curators have contextualized ~3,000 related Trends in 17 countries and seven languages since the beginning of the crisis, helping Twitter users answer the question “Why is this trending?” by attaching representative Tweets, writing explanatory titles and descriptions, or associating these Trends to Moments to give users even more context.** Our Search and Home Timeline prompts surface critical digital safety and security resources in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. Our dedicated event pages are available in 12 languages and in more than 67 countries – we continue to expand this tool. We created a Topic to help people stay informed right in the Home Timeline, as well as a Twitter List featuring reliable news sources. For people using Twitter in Ukraine and Russia, we’ve paused some Tweet recommendations from people not followed on Home Timeline to reduce the risk of spreading unhealthy content. More broadly, we’re working across features like Topics, Lists, and Spaces to reinforce safety measures and guard against misuse – it’s important these tools are reliable and trustworthy. Our approach to state-affiliated media Since 2020, we have not recommended or amplified state-affiliated media accounts from certain countries and have added labels, including to Russian-linked entities. Last month, we expanded our approach, adding labels to Tweets that share links to Russian state-affiliated media websites. Much of the content from state-affiliated media came from these link shares, and not just from the accounts we’d been labeling as state-affiliated media. Since February 28, we’ve labeled more than 910,175 unique Tweets that contain links to Russian state-affiliated media.** As noted above, and as is standard with our labels, these Tweets are not eligible for amplification, meaning they aren’t recommended in your home timeline, notifications, and other places on Twitter. Our interventions continue to make a difference in decreasing the reach of this content. (a selection of early results from the effect of these interventions showed a 30% reduction of the reach of this content*). We’ve now begun adding additional labels to multiple state-affiliated media accounts from Belarus. We have also labeled one state-affiliated media account in Ukraine. As the conflict – and online conversation – evolves, we want to equip people on Twitter with context and enable informed experiences on the service. We believe that people have the right to know when a media account is affiliated with a state actor. During periods of conflict, enabling access to factual, reliable information, and making clear which accounts are controlled by participating states, is critical. To serve this mission, we’ll apply government and state-affiliated media labels to states engaged in inter-state conflict, in addition to those countries already covered by our existing work. The policy will help ensure we add context to conversations about global conflicts equitably. We intend to expand on our approach, labeling more countries over time. The recently announced European Union (EU) sanctions legally require us to withhold certain state-affiliated media content in EU member states, and we are complying with this requirement. Our global approach outside of the EU will continue to focus on de-amplifying this type of state-affiliated media content across our service and providing important context through our labels. Our approach to government labels We are labeling qualifying government accounts to provide additional context. We’ll be rolling out government account labels to Ukrainian government accounts. 5 April 2022 A free and open internet is vital, and people around the world should have equal and shared access to information. When a government blocks or limits access to online services within their state, undercutting the public’s voice and ability to freely access information, but continues to use online services for their own communications, a severe information imbalance is created. Particularly in moments of active, armed interstate conflict, the harms created by this imbalance are acute; access to information, and to the ability to share information, are of paramount importance. We seek to promote open access to information through public conversation. To address the harmful dynamics created by blocks and limitations on online services, we will not amplify or recommend government accounts belonging to states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict – whether Twitter is blocked in that country or not. This means these accounts won’t be amplified or recommended to people on Twitter, including across the Home Timeline, Explore, Search, and other places on the service. We will first apply this policy to government accounts belonging to Russia. Attempts by states to limit or block access to free information within their borders are uniquely harmful, and run counter to Twitter’s belief in healthy and open public conversation. We’re committed to treating conversations about global conflicts more equitably, and we’ll continue to evaluate whether this policy may be applied in other contexts, beyond interstate armed conflict. On broader rule enforcement As we do around major global events, our safety and integrity teams are actively monitoring for potential risks. We recognize some high-profile accounts, including those of journalists (especially female journalists), activists, agencies, and government officials, may be particularly vulnerable. We’re working to mitigate any attempts at targeted account takeover or manipulation and have made account security resources available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. We are also working with our partners around the world, including members of our Trust and Safety Council, to identify and escalate urgent requests for support from journalists, activists, and others in need of assistance. We continue to proactively assess for inauthentic behavior and other violations of our rules. As of April 2022, we had removed more than 100,000 accounts* for violations of our platform manipulation and spam policy and this work continues today through proactive detection and human review. These accounts represent a wide range of attempts to manipulate the service – including opportunistic, financially-motivated spam — and we don’t currently believe they represent a specific, coordinated campaign associated with a government actor. We have also seen a substantial increase in the volume of media shared with deceptive, misleading, or inaccurate context, including old videos of conflicts, shared as if they’re taking place in Ukraine. In line with our synthetic and manipulated media policy, we have labeled or removed more than 66,407 pieces of content.** Our teams are proactively monitoring for violations of our hateful conduct policy and rules prohibiting the promotion of violence, and will continue to enforce against accounts or Tweets targeting people on the basis of their nationality and other groups as new narratives emerge. In line with our abusive behavior policy, specifically regarding the denial of violent events, we have taken enforcement action on numerous accounts that denied or shared misleading claims about violent actions and those affected during the war. We value transparency in this work, and in the coming months we intend to release targeted datasets about the conflict to the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) for further analysis. 5 April 2022 In the development and enforcement of our rules, we remain focused on enabling public conversation, and protecting the safety of people both online and offline. We are guided by international humanitarian law, specifically Article 13 of Geneva Convention III (on protecting prisoners of war (PoWs) from any physical or psychological abuse or threat thereof, and encompasses a prohibition on humiliating them) and do not want Twitter to be used by state actors to infringe this law. Our work to protect the conversation is informed by consultation with a wide range of trusted partners, including international human rights organizations, to ensure our approach considers the number of factors at play. To that end, we will now ask government or state affiliated media accounts to remove any media published that features prisoners of war (PoW) under our private information and media policy. We will also add a warning interstitial to media published by government or state affiliated media accounts featuring PoWs, that has a compelling public interest. Lastly, we will now require the removal of any Tweets, regardless of who posts them, if there is PoW content shared with abusive intent, such as insults, calls for retaliation, mocking/taking pleasure in suffering of PoWs, or for any other behavior that violates the Twitter rules. 10 May 2022 In April, we announced that we would not amplify or recommend government accounts of states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict, beginning with Russian government accounts. Our approach has proven effective – for Russian government accounts, early results show that; Engagements per Tweet decreased by approximately 25%; The number of accounts that engaged with those Tweets decreased by 49%. We’ve long believed that content moderation should extend beyond the removal of content or accounts. Not amplifying – meaning the content isn’t recommended on Home Timelines and other surfaces – and adding contextual labels quickly reduces content’s reach and visibility on Twitter, at scale. We consider a range of enforcement actions, and aim to ensure they're proportionate to the risk of harm created by the content. People's choices also influence how and what they see on Twitter; in this case, content from these accounts will still be shown to their followers, but won't be recommended to other people on Twitter. Our approach to monetization Since the week of February 21, we’ve paused advertising in Ukraine and Russia to ensure that critical public safety information is elevated, and that ads don’t detract from the conversation on Twitter. Content that discusses or focuses on the war, or that is considered false or misleading under the Twitter Rules, is not eligible for monetization. We’ve also demonetized Search terms related to the war, preventing ads from appearing on the Search results pages for certain words. Taking a step back, it’s important to keep in mind that since 2017 we’ve banned advertising from all accounts owned by Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik and donated the profits to NGOs working on digital literacy, misinformation, and election integrity. In 2019, we banned all state-backed news media advertising and political advertising. Supporting impacted communities We continue to engage and support humanitarian organizations on the ground. Through our giving campaign for Twitter employees, we’re routing donations to recognized organizations directly supporting Ukrainian refugees, matching all donations, and making direct contributions to partner organizations. We’re also providing high-value product donations and Ads for Good grants to help further these organizations’ critical work and amplify their message on Twitter. So far, these campaigns have made more than 118,271,185 impressions* on Twitter. What’s next? As the situation in Ukraine evolves, we’ll continue to iterate on our approach, focusing on reducing potential harm and surfacing reliable information.

Цей допис було вперше опубліковано 16 березня 2022 року. Його остання версія від 7 вересня 2022 року включає оновлені показники впливу нашої роботи. Відомості про наш підхід доступні англійською, українською та російською мовами. Ми, як і безліч інших людей з усього світу, занепокоєні й пригнічені через вторгнення Росії в Україну та гуманітарну катастрофу, яка там розгортається. Нашим найпершим пріоритетом є сприяння безпеці людей у нашому сервісі та за його межами, і наші команди активно працюють над цим. Ми вважаємо, що несемо перед громадськістю відповідальність (особливо в періоди кризи) за проактивний контроль над дотриманням наших правил, збереження доступу до Twitter, підвищення видимості достовірної і надійної інформації, захист конфіденційності та безпеки користувачів нашого сервісу та інших людей, а також запобігання маніпулюванню громадським діалогом. Протягом останніх кількох тижнів люди з України, Росії та всього світу користувалися Twitter, щоб ділитися критично важливою інформацією в режимі реального часу, знаходити підтримку, спілкуватися та висловлювати свої думки. Ми знаємо, що доступ до Twitter у Росії зараз обмежується для певних людей. Як ми вже казали, ми вважаємо, що вільний та відкритий Інтернет є критично важливим і що в людей у всьому світі повинні бути однакові можливості доступу до інформації. Ми відповідально ставимося до нашої ролі й до ролі нашого сервісу. Нижче ми публікуємо новини щодо нашого підходу й докладнішу інформацію про наші дії. Підвищення видимості надійної інформації Зважаючи на важливу роль алгоритмів у рекомендації та поширенні контенту онлайн, ми вважаємо, що модерація контенту повинна виходити за рамки бінарної логіки «залишити/вилучити». Наш підхід двоїстий: Якщо контент порушує правила Twitter, ми вживаємо відповідних дисциплінарних заходів на рівні твіту або облікового запису. До таких заходів належить, зокрема, вилучення контенту. Якщо ризик безпосередньої шкоди, пов’язаний із твітом, не дуже серйозний, але без контексту цей твіт може вводити в оману, ми приділяємо основну увагу зменшенню його охоплення та не просуваємо його у стрічках користувачів. Обмеження поширення контенту суттєво знижує його видимість, а позначки дають додають важливий контекст. Ми спрощуємо пошук надійних новин і достовірних відомостей, а також підвищуємо рівень безпеки в усіх розділах Twitter — від головної сторінки до вкладки «Огляд». Добірні моменти Twitter про війну в Україні поширюють новини й ресурси в реальному часі кількома мовами, і з початку конфлікту користувачі переглянули ці моменти понад 38,6 мільярдів разів.** З початку кризи куратори додали контекст приблизно до 3000 пов’язаних із нею трендів у 17 країнах сімома мовами. Завдяки цьому користувачам Twitter легше зрозуміти причини популярності цих трендів, адже куратори додають репрезентативні твіти, пишуть пояснювальні заголовки й описи, а також пов’язують ці тренди з моментами, щоб надати користувачам ще більше контексту.** Підказки на сторінці пошуку й у стрічці на головній сторінці вказують на важливі ресурси щодо цифрової безпеки англійською, українською та російською мовами. Наші спеціальні сторінки подій доступні 12 мовами в більш ніж 67 країнах, і ми продовжуємо працювати над розширенням можливостей цього інструменту. Ми створили тему, щоб люди могли отримувати важливу інформацію прямо на головній сторінці, а також додали список надійних джерел новин. Для користувачів Twitter з України та Росії ми перестали рекомендувати в стрічці на головній сторінці певні твіти від людей, на яких вони не підписані, щоб зменшити ризик поширення шкідливого контенту. Ми продовжуємо працювати над такими функціями, як «Теми», «Списки» та «Аудіокімнати», щоб посилити заходи безпеки та захистити ці функції від зловживання. Для нас важливо, щоб ці інструменти були надійними й достойними довіри. Наш підхід до контрольованих державою ЗМІ З 2020 року ми не рекомендуємо й не просуваємо облікові записи ЗМІ, що контролюються урядами певних країн, а також додаємо до них позначки (зокрема, до російських). Минулого місяця ми розширили свій підхід і почали додавати позначки до твітів із посиланнями на сайти російських проурядових ЗМІ. Значна частина контенту з цих ЗМІ надходила саме через такі посилання, причому не лише від профілів, позначених як контрольовані державою ЗМІ. З 28 лютого ми позначили понад 910 175 унікальних твітівз посиланнями на російські проурядові ЗМІ**. Як ми вже зазначали, згідно з нашою стандартною практикою позначені твіти не підлягають посиленому поширенню, тобто ми не рекомендуємо їх на головній сторінці, у сповіщеннях та в інших розділах Twitter. Наше втручання й далі сприяє зменшенню охоплення такого контенту (добірка ранніх результатів вжиття цих заходів показала, що охоплення зменшилося на 30%*). Тепер ми почали додавати позначки до облікових записів проурядових ЗМІ з Білорусі. Ми також позначили один такий обліковий запис з України. У той чай як військовий конфлікт — і його обговорення в Інтернеті — розвиваються далі, ми хочемо надати користувачам Twitter доступ до контексту й повноцінної інформації. Ми вважаємо, що люди мають право знати, чи пов’язані певні ЗМІ з державними суб’єктами. В періоди конфліктів надзвичайно важливо забезпечувати доступ до первірених фактів і надійної інформації, а також показувати, які облікові записи контролюються державами-учасницями. Тому на додачу до тих країн, для яких ми вже використовуємо такі позначки, ми позначатимемо урядові облікові записи та облікові записи контрольованих державою ЗМІ з країн, що беруть участь у міждержавних конфліктах. Це допоможе нам неупереджено додавати контекст до обговорення глобальних конфліктів. Ми маємо намір поступово розширювати коло країн, де буде запроваджено цей підхід. Нещодавні санкції Європейського Союзу (ЄС) юридично зобов’язують нас обмежувати доступ до певного контенту з проурядових ЗМІ в країнах, що входять до ЄС, і ми виконуємо цю вимогу. Згідно з нашим глобальним підходом, у країнах за межами ЄС ми й надалі стримуватимемо поширення такого контенту в нашому сервісі та надаватимемо важливий контекст за допомогою позначок. Наш підхід щодо позначення урядових облікових записів Ми позначаємо урядові облікові записи, що відповідають визначеним критеріям, щоб забезпечити додатковий контекст. Скоро ми плануємо додати такі позначки до урядових профілів з України. 5 квітня 2022 р. Вільний і відкритий Інтернет є надзвичайно важливим, і люди у всьому світі повинні мати рівний і спільний доступ до інформації. Коли уряд блокує або обмежує доступ до онлайн-сервісів у державі, підриваючи здатність суспільства висловлюватись і мати вільний доступ до інформації, але продовжує використовувати онлайн-сервіси для власної комунікації, утворюється глибокий інформаційний дисбаланс. Особливо значною є шкода, яку такий дисбаланс завдає в часи активних збройних міждержавних конфліктів. Доступ до інформації та можливість поширювати інформацію мають першочергову важливість. Ми прагнемо сприяти відкритому доступу до інформації через публічне обговорення. Щоб протидіяти шкідливій динаміці, що виникла через блокування та обмеження доступу до онлайн-сервісів, ми не просуватимемо й не рекомендуватимемо урядові профілі з країн, які обмежують доступ до вільної інформації та беруть участь у міждержавних збройних конфліктах, незалежно від того, чи заблоковано в цих країнах Twitter. Це означає, що такі облікові записи не просуватимуться й не рекомендуватимуться користувачам Twitter у стрічці на головній сторінці, на вкладках «Огляд» і «Пошук» та в інших розділах платформи. Перш за все ми застосуємо цю політику до урядових облікових записів із Росії. Спроби держав обмежити або заблокувати доступ до вільної інформації у межах своїх кордонів завдають великої шкоди й суперечать переконанням Twitter щодо здорового й відкритого публічного діалогу. Ми прагнемо забезпечити для всіх рівні можливості обговорення глобальних конфліктів і продовжимо оцінювати доцільність застосування цієї політики в інших контекстах, не пов’язаних із міждержавними збройними конфліктами. Додаткові заходи для забезпечення дотримання правил Як і в разі будь-яких інших важливих глобальних подій, наші спеціалісти, що відповідають за безпеку й достовірності інформації, активно відстежують потенційні ризики. Ми розуміємо, що облікові записи певних відомих осіб, зокрема журналістів (особливо жіночої статі), активістів, організацій і урядових службовців, можуть бути особливо вразливими. Ми намагаємося запобігати будь-яким спробам цілеспрямованого захоплення облікових записів або маніпулювання ними й надаємо доступ до ресурсів щодо безпеки облікових записів англійською, українською та російською мовами. Крім цього, разом із нашими партнерами з усього світу, зокрема з членами Ради з безпеки та довіри, ми виявляємо термінові запити на підтримку від журналістів, активістів та інших людей, яким потрібна допомога, і передаємо їх відповідним особам. Ми продовжуємо проактивно відстежувати неавтентичну поведінку та інші порушення наших правил. Станом на квітень 2022 року ми видалили понад 100 000 облікових записів* через порушення нашої політики щодо щодо маніпулювання платформою та поширення спаму. Ця робота продовжується й зараз завдяки людям, які активно виявляють і розглядають порушення. Власники видалених облікових записів здійснили чимало спроб маніпулювання нашим сервісом, зокрема розсилали опортуністичний, фінансово вмотивований спам. Наразі немає підстав вважати, що вони є частиною скоординованої кампанії, пов’язаної з урядовим суб’єктом. Ми також помітили суттєве збільшення кількості медіафайлів, які поширюються в оманливому або неточному контексті, зокрема старих відео про інші конфлікти, що подаються під виглядом подій в Україні. У рамках нашої політики щодо штучно створених і спеціально оброблених медіафайлів ми позначили або видалили понад 66 407 одиниць контенту.** Наші спеціалісти проактивно відстежують порушення політики щодо розпалювання ненависті та правил, які забороняють заохочення до насилля. На фоні виникнення нових наративів вони й надалі вживатимуть дисциплінарних заходів щодо облікових записів та твітів, спрямованих проти представників певної національності та інших груп. Згідно з нашою політикою щодо неправомірної поведінки, зокрема щодо заперечення пов’язаних із насильством подій, ми вжили дисциплінарних заходів щодо численних користувачів, які заперечували насильницькі дії або поширювали оманливі твердження про такі дії та про людей, які постраждали від них під час війни. Ми цінимо прозорість своєї роботи й у найближчі місяці плануємо випустити спеціальні бази даних про конфлікт у Консорціумі Twitter для дослідження модерації (TMRC) для подальшого аналізу. 5 квітня 2022 р. Під час розробки та забезпечення дотримання наших правил ми й далі зосереджуємо увагу на сприянні публічному діалогу й захисті людей як онлайн, так і офлайн. Ми керуємося міжнародним гуманітарним правом, зокрема статтею 13 третьої Женевської конвенції (яка забороняє застосовувати до військовополонених фізичне або психологічне насилля, погрожувати їм таким насиллям, а також принижувати їх), і не хочемо, щоб Twitter використовувався державними суб’єктами для порушення цього закону. Докладаючи зусиль для захисту публічного діалогу, ми консультуємося з широким колом надійних партнерів, зокрема з міжнародними правозахисними організаціями, щоб гарантувати, що наш підхід враховує низку наявних факторів. У зв’язку з цим віднині ми проситимемо власників урядових облікових записів і облікових записів контрольованих державою ЗМІ видаляти будь-які опубліковані медіафайли, на яких зображені військовополонені, відповідно до нашої політики щодо особистої інформації та медіафайлів. Якщо твіти з медіафайлами про військовополонених, опубліковані урядовими обліковими записами або облікованими записами контрольованих державою ЗМІ, є об’єктом значного суспільного інтересу, ми приховуватимемо їх за вставкою з попередженням. Нарешті, ми вимагатимемо видалення будь-яких твітів про військовополонених, незалежно від того, хто їх опублікував, якщо вони мають образливий характер (наприклад, містять образливі вирази, заклики до помсти, глузування зі страждань військовополонених або їх схвалення) або іншим чином порушують Правила Twitter. 10 травня 2022 р. У квітні ми оголосили, що не підсилюватимемо й не рекомендуватимемо урядові облікові записи держав, які обмежують доступ до вільної інформації та беруть участь у міждержавних збройних конфліктах, починаючи з російських. Наш підхід виявився ефективним, що підтверджують ранні результати, пов’язані з російськими урядовими обліковими записами. Взаємодія з твітами знизилася в середньому на 25%. Кількість користувачів, які взаємодіяли з цими твітами, зменшилася на 49%. Ми вже давно вважаємо, що модерація не повинна обмежуватися видаленням контенту чи облікових записів. Коли ми не просуваємо контент, тобто не рекомендуємо його на головній сторінці та в інших розділах, і додаємо до нього позначки з контекстом, це також сприяє швидкому й масштабному зниженню видимості й охоплення такого контенту в Twitter. Ми маємо широкий арсенал дисциплінарних заходів і намагаємося застосовувати їх пропорційно до ризику завдання шкоди, пов’язаного з контентом. Рішення користувачів також впливають на те, як і що вони бачать у Twitter; у даному випадку контент із таких облікових записів буде й надалі доступний їхнім читачам, але не буде рекомендуватися іншим користувачам Twitter. Наш підхід до монетизації З того тижня в лютому, коли почалася війна, ми призупинили рекламу в Україні та Росії, щоб підвищити видимість важливої інформації про громадську безпеку та не відполікати увагу від обговорення подій у Twitter. Контент, який стосується війни або вважається невірним чи оманливим згідно з Правилами Twitter, не можна монетизувати. Ми також скасували монетизацію пошукових запитів, що стосуються війни, щоб запобігти появі реклами на сторінках результатів пошуку за такими запитами. Варто зауважити, що ще в 2017 році ми заборонили рекламу  з усіх облікових записів, що належать каналам Russia Today (RT) і Sputnik, і жертвуємо доходи неурядовим організаціям, діяльність яких пов’язана з цифровою грамотністю, запобіганням дезінформації та забезпеченням чесності виборів. У 2019 році ми заборонили рекламу всіх проурядових новинних ЗМІ, а також політичну рекламу. Підтримка постраждалих громад Ми продовжуємо залучати й підтримувати гуманітарні організації в місцях конфлікту. Кошти, отримані в результаті збору пожертв серед працівників Twitter, ми передаємо офіційним організаціям, які безпосередньо підтримують українських біженців. При цьому ми подвоюємо всі пожертви й робимо прямі внески у діальність партнерських організацій. Ми також надаємо цінні пожертви у формі продуктів і грантів в рамках програми Ad for Good, щоб допомагати цим організаціям у їхній важливій роботі та привернути увагу до їхніх закликів у Twitter. Наразі ці кампанії отримали понад 118 27 185 показів* у Twitter. Що ми плануємо робити далі У міру того як ситуація в Україні розвиватиметься далі, ми продовжуватимемо вдосконалювати свій підхід, приділяючи основну увагу зменшенню потенційної шкоди та поширенню надійної інформації.

Русский Примечание редакции. Эта статья была впервые опубликована 16 марта 2022 года. Ее последняя версия от 7 сентября 2022 года включает обновленные показатели влияния нашей работы. Информация о наших действиях представлена на английском, украинском и русском языках. Как и многие люди в мире, мы глубоко встревожены и опечалены вторжением России в Украину и разворачивающимся там гуманитарным кризисом. Одним из наших приоритетов является обеспечение безопасности людей в рамках нашего сервиса и за его пределами, и наши специалисты усердно работают в этом направлении. Мы считаем себя ответственными перед общественностью — особенно в периоды кризиса — за контроль над соблюдением наших правил, сохранение доступа к Twitter, повышение видимости достоверной и надежной информации, защиту конфиденциальности и безопасности пользователей нашего и других сервисов, а также пресечение попыток манипулирования общественным мнением. За последние несколько недель люди в Украине, России и во всем мире использовали Twitter как площадку для того, чтобы в режиме реального времени делиться важной информацией, находить поддержку, общаться и высказывать свое мнение. К сожалению, для некоторых людей в России доступ в Twitter ограничен. Как мы уже заявляли ранее, мы считаем, что свободный и открытый Интернет имеет жизненно важное значение и люди во всем мире должны иметь одинаковый доступ к информации. Мы со всей серьезностью относимся и к нашей социальной роли, и к роли нашего сервиса. Ниже мы делимся новостями о наших действиях и более подробной информацией о предпринимаемых усилиях. Повышение видимости достоверной информации Учитывая важную роль, которую в Интернете играют алгоритмы рекомендаций и увеличения показов контента, мы считаем, что следует выходить за рамки бинарной системы модерации информации. Мы предлагаем два варианта решения. Если контент нарушает Правила Twitter, мы примем принудительные меры в отношении твита или учетной записи — вплоть до удаления материалов. В случае, если риск причинения непосредственного вреда из-за твита не так серьезен, но без контекста он может ввести людей в заблуждение, мы стараемся ограничить охват этого твита и не продвигаем его в лентах пользователей. Уменьшение охвата аудитории значительно снижает видимость публикаций, а маркировка контента помогает прояснять контекст. Мы упрощаем поиск надежных новостей и достоверной информации, а также повышаем уровень безопасности во всех разделах Twitter — от главной страницы до вкладки «Обзор». Курируемые моменты Twitter о войне в Украине содержат новости, которые обновляются в режиме реального времени, а также ресурсы на нескольких языках, и с начала конфликта пользователи посмотрели эти моменты более 38,6 миллиардов раз.** С начала кризиса кураторы добавили контекст приблизительно к 3000 связанных с ним актуальных тем в 17 странах на семи языках. Чтобы помочь пользователям Twitter понять причины популярности этих тем, кураторы прилагают к ним показательные твиты, пишут поясняющие заголовки и описания, а также связывают эти актуальные темы с моментами, предоставляя пользователям более широкий контекст.** Из ленты на главной странице и со страницы поиска можно открыть важные материалы по цифровой безопасности и защите на английском, украинском и русском языках. Наши специальные страницы событий доступны на 12 языках в более чем 67 странах, и мы продолжаем расширять возможности этого сервиса. Мы создали специальную тему, чтобы пользователи могли узнавать важные новости прямо на главной странице, а также добавили список надежных новостных источников. Для тех, кто использует Twitter в Украине и России, мы перестали рекомендовать в ленте на главной странице твиты людей, на которых пользователь не подписан, чтобы снизить риск распространения «нездорового» контента. Что касается работы всей платформы, мы сосредоточили внимание на повышении эффективности таких функций, как темы, списки и аудиокомнаты, чтобы усилить меры безопасности и предотвратить неправильное использование этих функций. Нам важно, чтобы эти инструменты были надежными и заслуживали доверия. Наш подход к СМИ, которые контролируются государством Начиная с 2020 года мы не рекомендуем и не продвигаем учетные записи контролируемых государством СМИ из определенных стран, в том числе из России, и добавляем к таким учетным записям метки. В прошлом месяце мы расширили эту функцию и начали добавлять метки к твитам, которые содержат ссылки на веб-сайты российских проправительственных СМИ. Большая часть контента из таких СМИ поступала по этим ссылкам, причем не только из учетных записей, помеченных нами как государственные СМИ. С 28 февраля мы пометили более 910 175 уникальных твитов со ссылками на СМИ, контролируемые правительством России**. Как уже отмечалось выше, в соответствии с нашей стандартной практикой помеченные твиты не подлежат усиленному распространению, то есть мы не рекомендуем их пользователям на главной странице, в уведомлениях и в других разделах Twitter. Наше вмешательство по-прежнему способствует уменьшению охвата такого контента (подборка ранних результатов применения этих мер показала, что охват уменьшился на 30%*). Недавно мы начали добавлять метки к учетным записям проправительственных СМИ из Беларуси. Мы также пометили одну такую учетную запись из Украины. На фоне развивающегося конфликта и посвященных ему онлайн-дискуссий мы хотим предоставить пользователям Twitter доступ к контексту и полноценной информации. Мы считаем, что люди имеют право знать, связана ли учетная запись того или иного СМИ с государственными лицами. Предоставление доступа к проверенной достоверной информации и четкое определение того, какие учетные записи контролируются государствами — участниками конфликта, имеет решающее значение в такие сложные периоды. Поэтому в дополнение к тем странам, для которых мы уже применяем такие метки, мы будем помечать правительственные учетные записи и учетные записи контролируемых государством СМИ из стран, вовлеченных в межгосударственные конфликты. Это поможет нам беспристрасно добавлять контекст в обсуждения глобальных конфликтов. Мы намерены продолжать маркировку учетных записей, со временем внедряя ее в новых странах. В связи с недавними санкциями Европейского союза (ЕС) мы обязаны скрывать определенный контент из контролируемых государством СМИ в странах-членах ЕС, и мы соблюдаем это требование. Наши действия за пределами ЕС будут по-прежнему сосредоточены на ограничении распространения контента из таких СМИ и предоставлении важного контекста с помощью меток. Наш подход к маркировке правительственных учетных записей Мы помечаем соответствующие нашим критериям правительственные учетные записи, чтобы предоставлять пользователям контекст. В дальнейшем мы планируем добавить такие метки к украинским правительственным учетным записям. 5 апреля 2022 г. Свободный и открытый Интернет невероятно важен, а у людей по всему миру должен быть равный доступ к информации. Когда правительство блокирует или ограничивает доступ к онлайн-сервисам на территории своего государства, препятствуя свободе слова и открытому доступу к информации, и при этом продолжает использовать онлайн-сервисы для собственной коммуникации, создается значительный информационный дисбаланс. Такой дисбаланс наносит значительный вред, особенно во время активного вооруженного межгосударственного конфликта. Доступ к информации и возможность делиться этой информацией имеет первостепенную важность. Мы стремимся обеспечивать открытый доступ к информации, способствуя общественному диалогу. Чтобы устранить неблагоприятную динамику, созданную блокировкой и ограничением онлайн-сервисов, мы не будем продвигать или рекомендовать правительственные учетные записи тех государств, которые ограничивают доступ к свободной информации и вовлечены в вооруженный межгосударственный конфликт, вне зависимости от того, заблокирован ли Twitter на территории этих стран. Это означает, что такие учетные записи не будут продвигаться или рекомендоваться пользователям Twitter в ленте на главной странице, на вкладках «Обзор» и «Поиск» и в других разделах сервиса. Прежде всего, такая политика будет применена к правительственным учетным записям из России. Попытки государств ограничить или заблокировать доступ к свободной информации на своей территории являются крайне вредоносными, а также противоречат нашим представлениям о здоровом и открытом общественном диалоге. Мы стремимся к тому, чтобы у людей были равные возможности обсуждать глобальные конфликты, и продолжим оценивать целесообразность применения этой политики в других контекстах, помимо межгосударственных вооруженных конфликтов. Обеспечение соблюдения наших правил Как и в случае с любыми крупномасштабными событиями, наши специалисты по обеспечению безопасности и достоверности информации активно отслеживают потенциальные риски. Мы понимаем, что учетные записи некоторых известных людей, в том числе журналистов (особенно женщин), активистов, агентств и государственных чиновников, могут быть особенно уязвимы. Мы работаем над предотвращением любых попыток целенаправленного захвата или манипулирования учетными записями, и составили материалы по обеспечению безопасности учетной записи на английском, украинском и русском языках. Мы также сотрудничаем с партнерами по всему миру, в том числе с членами нашего Совета по доверию и безопасности, для выявления и передачи срочных запросов о поддержке от журналистов, активистов и других лиц, нуждающихся в помощи. Мы продолжаем активно отслеживать неаутентичное поведение и другие нарушения правил нашей платформы. По состоянию на апрель 2022 года мы удалили более 100 000 учетных записей* за нарушение нашей политики в отношении манипулирования платформой и спама. Эта работа продолжается и сегодня благодаря людям, которые активно выявляют и рассматривают нарушения. Удаленные учетные записи пытались манипулировать нашим сервисом, в том числе распространяя оппортунистический, финансово мотивированный спам. На данный момент мы не видим в этом признаков скоординированной кампании, связанной с властями. Мы также наблюдаем существенное увеличение объема медийного контента, представляемого в обманном, вводящем в заблуждение или неверном контексте, включая старые видеоролики о других конфликтах, распространяемые под видом событий в Украине. В рамках политики в отношении искусственно созданных или специально обработанных медиафайлов мы пометили или удалили более 66 407 единиц контента.** Специалисты Twitter активно отслеживают нарушения нашей политики в отношении разжигания ненависти и правил, запрещающих пропаганду насилия, и по мере возникновения новых нарративов будут и дальше принимать меры в отношении учетных записей и твитов, направленных против представителей определенной национальности или других групп. В соответствии с нашей политикой в отношении оскорбительного поведения, в частности отрицания событий, связанных с насилием, мы приняли вынужденные меры в отношении многочисленных пользователей, которые отрицали факт насильственных действий или распространяли вводящие в заблуждение утверждения о таких действиях и о людях, которые пострадали от них во время войны. Мы ценим прозрачность своей работы и в ближайшие месяцы планируем выпустить специальные базы данных о конфликте в Консорциуме Twitter для исследований модерации (TMRC) для последующего анализа. 5 апреля 2022 г. Разрабатывая правила и контролируя их соблюдение, мы уделяем основное внимание предоставлению возможностей для общественного диалога и обеспечению безопасности людей как в Интернете, так и вне сети. Мы руководствуемся принципами международного гуманитарного права, в частности статьей 13 третьей Женевской конвенции (она запрещает подвергать военнопленных физическому или психологическому насилию, угрожать им таким насилием, а также унижать их), и мы не хотим, чтобы Twitter стал инструментом в руках государственных деятелей, нарушающих этот закон. Защищая общественный диалог, мы консультируемся со множеством надежных партнеров, включая международные организации по защите прав человека, чтобы наш подход учитывал различные важные факторы. В связи с этим отныне мы будем просить владельцев правительственных учетных записей и учетных записей контролируемых государством СМИ удалять любые опубликованные медиафайлы, в которых фигурируют военнопленные, согласно нашей политике в отношении конфиденциальной информации и медиафайлов. Если твиты с медиафайлами о военнопленных, размещенные правительственными учетными записями или учетными записями контролируемых государством СМИ, являются объектом существенного общественного интереса, мы будем скрывать из за вставкой с предупреждением. Наконец, мы будем требовать удалить любые твиты о военнопленных, независимо от того, кто их опубликовал, если они имеют оскорбительный характер (например, содержат оскорбительные выражения, призывы к расправам, насмешки над страданиями военнопленных или их одобрение) либо другим образом нарушают правила Twitter. 10 мая 2022 г. В апреле мы объявили о том, что не будем продвигать или рекомендовать правительственные учетные записи государств, которые ограничивают доступ к свободной информации и участвуют в межгосударственных вооруженных конфликтах, начиная с российских. Наш подход оказался эффективным, о чем свидетельствуют ранние результаты, связанные с российскими правительственными учетными записями. Взаимодействие с твитами снизилось в среднем на 25%. Число пользователей, которые взаимодействовали с этими твитами, уменшилось на 49%. Мы уже давно считаем, что модерация не должна ограничиваться удалением контента или учетных записей. Когда мы не продвигаем контент, то есть не рекомендуем его в ленте на главной странице и в других разделах, и добавляем к нему метки с контекстом, это также способствует быстрому и масштабному снижению видимости и охвата такого контента в Twitter. Мы прибегаем к широкому спектру принудительных мер и стараемся применять их пропорционально риску причинения вреда, связанному с контентом. Решения пользователей также влияют на то, как и что они видят в Twitter; в данном случае контент из таких учетных записей по-прежнему будет виден их читателям, но не будет рекомендован другим пользователям Twitter. Наш подход к монетизации С той недели, которая началась 21 февраля, мы приостановили рекламу в Украине и России, чтобы обеспечить распространение важной информации об общественной безопасности и не отвлекать внимание от обсуждений в Twitter. Контент, который обсуждает военные действия или посвящен им, а также контент, который считается ложным или вводящим в заблуждение согласно Правилам Twitter, не подлежит монетизации. Мы также отказались от монетизации поисковых запросов, связанных с военными действиями, чтобы предотвратить показ объявлений на страницах результатов поиска по таким запросам. Оглядываясь назад, важно отметить, что с 2017 года мы запрещаем рекламу из всех учетных записей, которые принадлежат каналам Russia Today (RT) и Sputnik, и жертвуем доходы неправительственным организациям, чья деятельность связана с цифровой грамотностью, предотвращением дезинформации и обеспечением честности выборов. В 2019 году мы запретили рекламу всех проправительственных новостных СМИ, а также политическую рекламу. Поддержка пострадавших сообществ Мы продолжаем поддерживать локальные гуманитарными организаци и сотрудничать с ними. В рамках благотворительной кампании, проводимой среди сотрудников Twitter, мы направляем пожертвования в известные организации, напрямую поддерживающие украинских беженцев. При этом мы удваиваем все пожертвования и делаем прямые взносы в партнерские организации. Мы также делаем ценные пожертвования в виде продуктов и грантов в рамках программы Ad for Good, чтобы помочь этим организациям в их важной работе и привлечь внимание к их призывам в Twitter. На данный момент такие кампании получили в Twitter уже более 118 271 185 показов*. Что мы планируем делать дальше По мере развития ситуации в Украине мы продолжим совершенствовать правила нашей платформы, сосредоточив внимание на снижении потенциального вреда от негативного контента и предоставлении достоверной информации.

Here’s how","text":"Over the years, Twitter has become a critical communication tool for responding to natural disasters. Our teams have a longstanding commitment to working alongside global partners and developers to share important information, provide real-time updates, facilitate relief efforts, and much more. We also take steps to address misleading information that can surface during these crises. To help ensure our service remains a resource for as many people as possible, we’ve put together a snapshot of some of the ways Twitter can be used to help during natural disasters. It’s important to raise awareness about natural disasters before they happen. That’s why Twitter regularly collaborates with organizations to keep people informed about and prepared for extreme weather and other potential emergencies. In September, for example, Twitter Australia partnered with the Australian Red Cross on a Timeline and Trend Takeover campaign designed to help people prepare for weather-related emergencies. The #EmergencyReady campaign was viewed nearly 5 million times in 24 hours. Being prepared for disasters means no one is left behind or overlooked. Twitter Australia generously provided national visibility of key safety messages about disaster preparedness, at a critical time of year for all Australians. Andrew Coghlan Head of Emergency Services, Australian Red Cross Twitter partners frequently with crisis response organizations all over the world to help enhance the capacity of those communicating with populations affected by natural disasters. When it comes to staying safe during natural disasters, Twitter can be a powerful resource for sharing critical information. In the wake of the 2017 Puebla earthquake in Mexico, for example, we collaborated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to put together a shareable list of best practices for communicating on Twitter during times of crisis. Similarly in 2021, as Japan approached the 10-year anniversary of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, our team shared a set of illustrations with important information about how best to communicate on Twitter in an emergency situation. This year we went further, organizing Twitter Spaces events with local Japanese media and other social media platforms to discuss reporting strategies for disaster prevention and readiness. We also created a custom origami crane emoji and hashtags to encourage participation in critical conversations around the subject. When people search for keywords on Twitter related to active emergency situations, we work to ensure they’re met with authoritative and credible information first. Search prompts are one important way we do this. When heavy flooding occurred in Pakistan beginning in June 2022, Twitter launched a #ThereIsHelp prompt to redirect our Pakistani audience to an emergency helpline at the Pakistani Red Crescent Society. Similarly, during this year’s Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines and Typhoon Noru in Southeast Asia, search prompts were created to help quickly deliver credible information to people on Twitter impacted by these extreme weather events. During natural disasters, Twitter has tools such as Moments and Lists that can be used to create a centralized source of credible information. In anticipation of 2022’s Hurricane Ian in the United States, for example, a Twitter Moment was created to elevate public service information as well as amplify announcements from local law enforcement and emergency services. Moments can also be used to address and correct misleading information, like when comments on hurricane preparedness made by the US president in August 2021 were mistakenly attributed to Hurricane Ian. In addition to Moments, Twitter Lists can be used to collect and quickly share information about natural disasters and emergency services. In Japan, for example, a dedicated TwitterLifeline List has been created highlighting the Twitter accounts of prefectures, crisis organizations, and public transportation services. Twitter México recently published a list highlighting earthquake-related Tweets in real time. There’s a long history of individuals and organizations finding innovative ways to harness the power of Twitter. For example, in India, partners in the medical industry came together to create @BloodDonorsIndia which amplifies the blood donation requests of individual patients dealing with a range of health problems. The account’s 1.2 million followers are able to reach potential donors that otherwise would have gone unreached, resulting in eight lives a day being saved through its efforts according to its own reporting. In another example, developers in California used our API to create an automated Twitter account that has been documenting earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area since 2009. Twitter also builds data partnerships to better understand the conversations happening on the platform. Most recently, we analyzed four extreme weather events to better determine patterns of those affected by natural disasters and build predictions for future events. We’re continually working to improve the ways we help communities prepare for and communicate during emergencies. Keep your eyes on @Twitter for the latest updates. The main reason I like [Twitter] as a source of data is that it integrates not just a measure of typical exposure — which is ‘Did the water come onto the land in a place where it wasn’t supposed to be? [It also] measures ‘What are people noticing? What are people talking about?’ Twitter can give us this aggregated measure of what those social consequences of that particular flood are.

Accounts found to be breaking our rules may be suspended without a refund. Twitter Blue is $8/month on web, and $11/month for those who sign up on iOS. Subscribers who sign up on one platform will have Twitter Blue access on all supported platforms (iOS, Android, and web). Existing Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to upgrade, cancel, or auto-renew their subscription at the new price. Prices may vary by region. We plan to offer subscriptions on Android soon. Subscribing to Twitter Blue is now available in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. We plan to roll out Blue to more countries soon. In addition to reviewing all accounts at sign up, we’re taking a number of other steps to detect and prevent impersonation. Subscribers who change their profile information, including display name, profile photo, and username (@handle), will temporarily lose their blue checkmark until those changes are reviewed by Twitter. Accounts created within the last 90 days, inactive accounts, accounts without a verified phone number, and accounts with recent changes to their profile information will not be able to subscribe to Twitter Blue at this time. Gold checkmarks and more In addition to these changes, starting today, we’re replacing the “official” label with a gold checkmark on some business accounts on Twitter. Soon, we’ll also add a gray checkmark for government and multilateral accounts. Learn more about profile labels on Twitter here. You can now apply for early access to Verification for Organizations. Apply now or read more here. Thank you to our Twitter Blue subscribers and our advertisers for your feedback and support! *Note: We continue to improve Twitter Blue. Subscriber-only features may be subject to change and some features are currently platform specific."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2022/how-many-people-come-twitter-for-news","date":"2022-01-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights","Journalism"],"title":"How many people come to Twitter for news?

We aim to enable healthy civic conversation on Twitter, while ensuring people have the context they need to make informed decisions about content they encounter. Because we’re a global service, there’s almost always an election happening on Twitter. Today, we’re announcing steps we’re taking ahead of the US midterms to protect civic conversation on Twitter. Our Civic Integrity Policy As a key part of the Twitter Rules, since 2018, our Civic Integrity Policy has helped people find credible information during elections and other civic processes — including in the Philippines, Kenya, Australia, Brazil, and India – just this year. Today, as we do ahead of other global elections, we’re activating enforcement of our Civic Integrity Policy for the 2022 US midterms. The Civic Integrity Policy covers the most common types of harmful misleading information about elections and civic events, such as: claims about how to participate in a civic process like how to vote, misleading content intended to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in the election, and misleading claims intended to undermine public confidence in an election – including false information about the outcome of the election. Tweets with this content may be labeled with links to credible information or helpful context, and Twitter will not recommend or amplify this content in areas of the product where Twitter makes recommendations. People on Twitter will see a prompt prior to liking or sharing labeled tweets, and in cases where there is potential for harm associated with the false or misleading claim, the Tweet may not be liked or shared to prevent the spread of the misleading information. Fake accounts that misrepresent affiliation to a candidate or elected official are prohibited under our existing Misleading & Deceptive Identities Policy — and we remain vigilant against potential coordinated manipulation efforts. And during this election period, and year-round, we continue to enforce our safety policies – including for conduct targeting election workers. Redesigned labels Late last year, we tested new misleading information labels and saw promising results. The new labels increased click through rates by 17%, meaning more people were clicking labels to read debunking content. We also saw notable decreases in engagement with Tweets labeled with the new design: -13% in replies, -10% in Retweets and -15% in likes. Finding reliable information Twitter wants to empower voters to find reliable information about how to register, how to vote, and the choices on their ballot. To make it easier to find reliable news and accurate information about participating in the civic process, we’re launching a number of product updates. Here’s what you can expect to see on Twitter as election day approaches in the US: Prebunks In the lead up to election day, we’ll share prompts with information about how and where to vote, directly to people’s timelines. We’re also bringing back prebunks — in English, Spanish, and all other languages supported on Twitter — to get ahead of misleading narratives on Twitter, and to proactively address topics that may be the subject of misinformation. Over the coming months, we’ll place prompts directly on people’s timelines in the US and in Search when people type related terms, phrases, or hashtags. State-specific event hubs We’ve begun rolling out state-specific event hubs as primaries take place across the country. These localized pages feature real-time election information from state election officials, plus local news outlets and journalists. Soon, we’ll roll out an additional, nationally focused Event page, available to everyone in the US. Dedicated Explore tab As elections take place around the world, Twitter often serves as the centralized hub for real-time political conversation, resources, and breaking news. We’ll be launching a dedicated Explore tab that will include: National news in both English and Spanish by reputable news outlets, curated by Twitter’s Curation team; Localized news and resources by state; Voter education public service announcements (PSAs) in English and Spanish, created using information from nonpartisan government and voting advocacy organizations. Identifying who’s running for office Our candidate account labels make it easier to identify who’s running for office. We began rolling out these labels in May, as primary elections kicked into full swing, and you’ll continue to see these labels until the end of the general election. These labels: Appear on designated candidate accounts for those running for US Senate, US House of Representatives, or Governor, who’ve qualified for the general election ballot; Contain critical candidate information; including the office the candidate is running for, the state the office is located in, and the district number (for US House candidates); Appear at the top of the candidate’s profile page and on all of their Tweets. Improving recommendations We’ve also made – and continue to make – updates to how and what we recommend on Twitter. Earlier this year, in the US and Brazil, we tested ways to prevent misleading Tweets from being recommended through notifications. Early results show that impressions on misleading information dropped by 1.6 million per month, as a direct result of the experiment. We’ve since applied this intervention to notification recommendations on Twitter and are exploring possibilities for other surfaces on Twitter. Protecting accounts We’re helping to protect and secure accounts of government officials, candidates for office, journalists, and more ahead of the midterms. Accounts will be reminded to use a strong password, encouraged to enable two-factor authentication, and asked to check the third-party apps they’ve connected to their accounts. We will also enable password reset protection for accounts by default to help prevent unauthorized password changes. In the coming weeks, we’ll apply additional proactive safeguards for these accounts, including: More sophisticated detections and alerts to help us, and account holders, respond rapidly to suspicious activity; Increased login defenses to prevent malicious account takeover attempts; Expedited account recovery support to ensure account security issues are resolved quickly. We take our role seriously Twitter plays a critical role in empowering democratic conversations, facilitating meaningful political debate, and providing information on civic participation – not only in the US, but around the world. People deserve to trust the election conversations and content they encounter on Twitter. We’re exploring other ways to help people make sense of content they encounter during these critical times. Keep an eye on @TwitterSafety for media literacy tips and suggestions, like how to spot misinformation, which were developed in partnership with educational experts. The features and tools outlined above, in combination with continued enforcement of the Twitter Rules, help make this possible. As election day nears, we’ll continue to share real-time information about our approach. Keep up with the latest at @TwitterGov, @Policy, and @TwitterSafety.

With Twitter Shops, merchants can handpick a collection of up to 50 products to showcase to shoppers on Twitter. The feature, which is free to use, gives people the chance to view products from the profiles of their favorite brands, so when you talk about and discover products on the timeline, you can now browse them on Twitter, too. When you go to the profile of a merchant that has Twitter Shops enabled, you’ll see a “View shop” button just above their Tweets. When you tap the button, it will open up that merchant’s shop, where you can scroll through items. When you’re ready to purchase, you can click on the product of your choice which will open an in-app browser where you can learn more about the product and checkout on the merchant’s website.

For now, people in the U.S. who use Twitter in English on iOS and Android devices will be able to view and interact with Twitter Shops. People are already talking about products on Twitter. We want Twitter Shops to be the home for merchants on Twitter where they can intentionally curate a catalog of products for their Twitter audience and build upon the product discussions already happening on our service by giving shoppers a point of action where a conversation can become a purchase. As we continue to test, we’ll explore how to make Shops more discoverable; adding new ways for merchants to tell their brand story through their Shops; expanding the number of products merchants can showcase, and bringing Twitter Shops to more merchants and more people.

Last updated: October 26, 2022. Picture this: Your favorite brand announces that it's dropping a new collection in a few weeks. The weeks fly by and on drop day… you completely forget about it. And that hot new item you wanted? All gone. If this sounds familiar, we’ve got something for you. People come to Twitter to talk about products and product drops every day.

We’re excited to change that and introduce new shopping features that empower shoppers to stay on top of the launches that matter most to them and provide merchants with another way to engage shoppers around big product moments. Meet Product Drops – the newest member of the Twitter Shopping family. With Product Drops, when a merchant Tweets about an upcoming launch, you’ll see a “Remind me” button at the bottom of the Tweet. With one tap, you can request to be reminded of the Drop. On launch day, you’ll get an in-app notification in your Notifications tab 15 minutes before and at the time of the drop, so you can be among the first to shop on the merchant’s website and (hopefully) beat out other shoppers. When you click on the notification, you’ll see a “Shop on website” button to purchase the item on the merchant’s website. Before you click the “Remind me” button, we know you probably want to know a little more about what you’re even signing up for. What’s the product? How much is it? What are people saying about it? We’ve got your back: when you click on the merchant’s Tweet, you’ll open the Product Details Page – a full-screen space where you can see all the information you need to make informed and confident purchase decisions. This includes the price, pictures, a description of the product, and a clickable hashtag that will show you what other shoppers on Twitter are saying about the product. Product Drops are available to all qualifying merchants in the United States and can be managed in the Twitter Shopping Manager. We've tested Product Drops with brands including @Dior, @Fossil x @JeffStaple, @HomeDepot, @LEGO_Group, and @unionlosangeles. Shoppers in the U.S. who use Twitter in English on iOS and Android devices will be able to see and engage with Product Drops. Don’t miss out on these drops! Follow these merchants on Twitter today and keep an eye on @TwitterBusiness for news about other drops. Stay tuned!

Birdwatch is a collaborative way to add helpful context to Tweets and keep people better informed. As a recap, the program is made up of a group of people, or contributors, who help identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. Only notes that are rated Helpful by a diverse group of contributors, or that “bridge” across groups of people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings, are made visible on Twitter. The program began testing in 2021 and is regularly being updated and improved thanks to analysis from our research team and feedback from our academic advisory board and Birdwatch contributors. Now, we’re rolling out a new onboarding process and expanding the visibility of notes to increase the positive impact of Birdwatch and enable healthier Twitter conversations. Here’s a look at what’s new, along with some important new findings that highlight the impact Birdwatch is already having on Twitter. We're rolling out an updated Birdwatch onboarding process that better incentivizes contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way. New Birdwatch contributors who have met the eligibility criteria* will begin with an initial Rating Impact score of zero, which they can increase by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. Once a contributor’s score has risen to five, they can start writing notes. Contributors can further increase their Writing and Rating Impact scores by both writing Helpful notes and continuing to rate notes written by others. Repeatedly writing notes that reach a status of Not Helpful, however, will result in a decreasing score and could temporarily lock a contributor’s note writing ability. *Birdwatch contributors must have a verified phone number from a trusted US-based carrier, no recent Twitter Rules violations, and a minimum six months on Twitter. With the new onboarding process in place, we’re ready to begin expanding our contributor base. We’ll start by adding larger groups of eligible applicants to the pilot on a more frequent basis. The process will be adjusted as needed as we closely monitor whether this change has any impact on either the quality or the frequency of contributions. The visibility of notes on public Tweets will also be increasing. In the coming weeks, more people using Twitter in the US will start to see notes on Tweets that Birdwatch contributors have collectively identified as Helpful. Importantly, this doesn’t mean you’ll start seeing notes on every Tweet, simply that a larger number of you will start seeing notes that have been rated Helpful. Our research indicates that Birdwatch is an effective way to keep people better informed on Twitter. According to the results of three surveys, people who see a Birdwatch note are, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. By analyzing our internal data, we also estimate that people on Twitter who see notes are, on average, 15-35% less likely to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Notes are intentionally designed to be as informative and helpful as possible — no matter who sees them — thanks in large part to the “bridging algorithm” we mentioned above. Here’s how it works: In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. This approach appears to be having an impact. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. The algorithm and all data it uses are publicly available on GitHub so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements.

We’ve been piloting our Birdwatch program for over a year to bring helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way. Now for the first time, we’re expanding the visibility of Birdwatch notes — written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter — to everyone in the US. Starting today, if you’re using Twitter in the US, you’ll begin to see some Tweets accompanied by a note containing relevant information that’s been rated “Helpful” by Birdwatch contributors. Most notes contain additional sources that can be clicked for an even deeper dive into a subject or conversation. You'll also have the ability to rate the notes you see to help us understand if they’re helpful or not. Birdwatch is made up of independent contributors, and individual notes are never written by Twitter, Inc. This is intentional, as it helps ensure our efforts to address potentially misleading information are informed by a diverse group of people who use our service. The program is designed to surface notes that are informative and helpful to as many people as possible thanks in large part to what’s known as a bridging algorithm. Here’s how it works: In order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. Check out our Birdwatch guide for more info on this. In many online spaces, especially those using engagement-based ranking, divisive content can be more likely to go viral. Bridging-based ranking systems aim to overcome this 'bias toward division'. Birdwatch’s use of bridging to elevate context found helpful by people that tend to disagree is an exciting step toward a better internet — one that supports those building common ground. Aviv Ovadya Technology and Public Purpose Fellow, Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School (2021-2022) Additionally, to keep the quality of notes high and encourage contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way, we developed a Birdwatch onboarding process through which new contributors earn the ability to write notes by consistently rating other contributors’ notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. We’re opting to expand the visibility of Birdwatch notes to everyone in the US based on research that indicates the program is helpful and informative to people who hold different points of view. According to the results of four surveys run at different times between August, 2021 and August, 2022, a person who sees a Birdwatch note is, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Survey participation ranged from 3,000 to more than 19,000 participants, and the results were consistent throughout the course of the year, even as news and Tweet topics changed. We also see that Birdwatch informs sharing behavior. Analyzing our internal data, we’ve found that a person on Twitter who sees a note is, on average, 15-35% less likely to choose to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation — there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. We believe that earning trust starts with transparency. That’s why we’ve made the Birdwatch algorithm publicly available on GitHub, along with all the data that powers it, so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements. Whether you’re a researcher, a hobbyist, or simply curious, you can explore and run the Birdwatch algorithm on your own computer using the guide link shared above.

Don’t worry, we’ve got you. Today Twitter is introducing a new way to share different types of visual content — videos, images, and GIFs — together in a single Tweet. Adding “mixed” media to a Tweet is simple and straightforward. When composing a Tweet, tap the “Media” or “GIF” icons and select the content you want to share (and don’t forget to add descriptive text to make your images more accessible). That’s it! You can add up to four videos, images, and/or GIFs per Tweet. The update is currently available on iOS and Android, however Tweets with different content types can be consumed on all platforms. We’re always looking for new and exciting ways to help creators share more and be seen. Mixing different types of visual content together in a single Tweet allows creators to express themselves beyond 280 characters and gives them more ways to tell their story. Really loving this new tool here on Twitter. It has opened up a whole new world of opportunity to share my work & the behind the scenes. Excited to see how creatives can capitalize on this feature and share more of their process moving forward. Stoked to see Twitter caring about creatives and how they can share their work through this medium. Twitter Creator As a professional photographer, I’m excited to use this feature to add some more interactive depth to the behind-the-scenes moments I share on Twitter. Twitter Creator This update is the latest example of how we’re working to make Twitter the easiest and most convenient place to share images, videos, and other creative content. It complements the rollout of two new video products — full-screen videos and a new video carousel in the Explore tab — that help make it easier than ever for people to find and watch what’s happening on Twitter.

In addition to this, local county governors and candidates for the country's 47 county assemblies will also be on the ballot this year for voters’ consideration. Elections on Twitter During any election,Twitter serves as a centralised hub for real-time political conversation and commentary, electoral resources, journalistic reports live from the campaign trail as well as a tool for people to hear directly from political representatives themselves. Our work to make Twitter an engaging and healthy platform for political discourse is long standing; in 2019 we banned political ads as we believe political messaging should be earned, not bought; we’ve expanded our policies around election misinformation and continue to add context and notices to Tweets with manipulated media, to ensure people have the context they need. 2022 Kenyan Elections Today, we wanted to share the steps we’ve taken and the trusted local partnerships we have, ahead of the 2022 Kenyan elections, ensuring the debate on Twitter is healthy, open and safe. Our work also ensures that Twitter continues to serve as the go-to place for people to see what’s happening, participate in the conversation, track campaign trails and consume verified information, so voters can make informed choices about what’s most important to them in this election. Partnerships As we work to improve the health of the public conversation - particularly during civic events like elections - we are committed to reaching beyond Twitter to intergrate diverse perspectives that make our service better for everyone. As part of that, we have partnered with a number of organisations to further amplify credible information during the Kenyan election. Elevate Credible Information: One such partner is Africa Check; established in 2012 as the continent’s first independent, nonpartisan fact-checking organisation that debunks dangerous statements, and empowers people to engage with information critically, while also building a culture of fact-checking across Africa. We are pleased to collaborate with Twitter as part of our election work in Kenya. The collaboration will allow us to address dis- and misinformation by fact-checking claims and identifying potential misinformation...Notably, the partnership with Twitter will deepen the impact of our media literacy project as it will allow us to reach a broader audience. Africa Check Independent, nonpartisan fact-checking organisation In the build-up to the Kenyan elections, Africa Check - which is part of the Fumbua collective, continues to combat false narratives, amplify accurate information and lead the activation of critical media literacy work across the region. \"We are pleased to collaborate with Twitter as part of our election work in Kenya. The collaboration will allow us to address dis- and misinformation by fact-checking claims and identifying potential misinformation. We will also highlight accurate, verified information ahead of the election on the platform so that voters can make informed decisions. Media literacy programmes are a proactive strategy to fight misinformation and allow us to use our fact-checking work to inoculate people against false information proactively and empower them to critically understand, analyse, and evaluate information instead of simply consuming and sharing it. We believe this enables them to make evidence-based decisions vital ahead of elections. Notably, the partnership with Twitter will deepen the impact of our media literacy project as it will allow us to reach a broader audience.\" - Africa Check This work is key to the protection of the election conversation and we look forward to continued partnerships and collaboration with Africa Check and all our other partner organisations, up to and after the Kenyan elections. Verification Ahead of the elections, Twitter worked with Kenyan partner organisations on verifying accounts of Government Agencies, Candidates, Political Parties, Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs), News Organisations and content creators. The blue Verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic and notable - giving people on Twitter more context about who they’re having conversations with so they can determine the way in which they engage with a certain account. Amplifying Credible Information Our teams are working to ensure that voters in Kenya are directed to credible information while they spend time on our platform. In line with our efforts to amplify credible information, we have been able to launch the following features: Custom Kenyan election Emoji: Today we launched a custom Kenyan elections emoji that will be activated by the hashtags #KenyaDecides, #KenyaDecides2022, #electionske #electionske2022. The special emoji, which pictures a ballot box with the Kenyan flag draped around it, aims to promote the discoverability of the election conversation and encourage active citizenship and a peaceful election process. Kenyan Election Prompt: We have launched an election prompt in collaboration with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) in both English and Swahili. The search prompt is a notification service that directs people in Kenya to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC’s) website where Kenyans will be able to access credible information about the elections when searching for keywords on Twitter, associated with the Kenyan General Election. Twitter Moments: Our Twitter Curation team is supporting the 2022 Kenyan Elections with the creation of election Moments which are curated stories designed to address misleading and false information around the presidential elections. These Twitter Moments, will include key dates, and general guidelines for participating in the electoral process from credible sources, including Kenya’s electoral regulator IEBC, media outlets, and fact-checking organizations. Policy enforcement In addition to enforcing our Policies on Hateful Conduct and Abusive Behaviour, we have implemented a clear Civic Integrity Policy so that people cannot use Twitter’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. The Policy targets the most directly harmful types of content, such as (but not limited to) misleading information about how to participate in an election or misleading information that intends to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in an election. Labeling: As such, in line with this policy, we will label Tweets that contain false or misleading information that undermines confidence in the election or false or misleading information related to the outcomes of the election. Tweets that are labeled under this policy will therefore have reduced visibility (not amplified) across the service and will lead to Twitter Moments with informative context on the topic - based on official, reliable sources and fact-checkers. Local engagement Our Sub-Saharan Africa policy team has also offered safety and security training to partner organisations, bringing them through tools such as mute, block and report, as well as various security tips and techniques such as two-factor authentication. The established cross-functional 2022 Kenyan elections team at Twitter, will work to protect the integrity of the election-related conversation, support partner groups and political representatives as well as identifying and curbing any threat to the integrity of the 2022 Kenyan election conversation on Twitter. We are committed to providing a service that fosters and facilitates political debate and we will continue to build on one of our core priorities, which is to protect political and civic conversation on Twitter through our policies, products and the integral partnerships we have around the world.

The National Cohesion and Integration Commission The Kenyan Judiciary -- Uchaguzi Mkuu wa Kenya, 2022 unafanyika kwenye Twitter Siku ya Jumanne ya tarehe 9 Agosti, wapiga kura wa Kenya watakuwa wakielekea kwenye vituo vya kupiga kura kwa ajii ya Uchaguzi Mkuu wa mwaka 2022, ambapo watapiga kura kuchagua Raisi mpya, Wabunge, na wawakilishi wa Bunge la Seneta la Kenya. Wakati huo huo, mwaka huu wapiga kura watapiga kura kuchagua wawakilishi wa serikali za ugatuzi na magavana wa kaunti zote 47. Uchaguzi kwenye Twitter Katika chaguzi zote, Twitter hutumika kama kituo cha majadiliano na maoni ya wakati halisi, chanzo cha habari za uchaguzi, sehemu ya waandishi wa habari kutoa taarifa za moja kwa moja kutoka kwenye mikutano ya kampeni na pia chombo ambacho kinawawezesha watu kuwasikia wawakilishi wao wa kisiasa moja kwa moja. Juhudi zetu za kuifanya Twitter kuwa jukwaa la majadiliano ya kisiasa ambalo ni shirikishi na lenye tija zimekuwa zikiendelea kwa muda mrefu sasa; mwaka 2019 tulizuia matangazo ya kisiasa kwa sababu tunaamini kwamba umaarufu wa kisiasa huja wenyewe, pasipo kununuliwa; tumeimarisha sera zetu kuhusu upotoshaji wa uchaguzi na tunaendelea kuongeza maudhui na taarifa kwenye machapisho yenye maudhui yanayopotosha, ili kuhakikisha kwamba watu wanapata muktadha wanaohitaji.. Uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022 Leo, tungependa kuwaeleza juu ya hatua tulizochukua na washirika wa ndani tulionao tunapoelekea kwenye uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022, ili kuhakikisha kuwa mijadala inayoendelea kwenye Twitter ni bora, ya wazi na salama. Kazi yetu pia inahakikisha kuwa Twitter inaendelea kuwa sehemu ambayo watu wanatembelea kuona mambo yanayoendelea, kushiriki mazungumzo, kufuatilia kampeni na kupata taarifa za kuaminika ili wapiga kura waweze kuchagua yale ambayo ni muhimu kwao wakiwa na taarifa sahihi kwenye uchaguzi huu. Ushirikiano Tunapoendelea kufanya kazi kuimarisha ubora wa mazungumzo ya umma (hasa zaidi ya wakati wa matukio ya kiraia kama uchaguzi) tumedhamiria kufika maeneo mengine nje ya Twitter ili kuunganisha vyanzo mbalimbali ambavyo vitafanya huduma yetu kuwa bora kwa watu wote. Kama mojawapo ya hatua katika kutimiza hilo, tunashirikiana na asasi mbalimbali ili kuongeza uwezo wa kupata taarifa za kuaminika wakati wa uchaguzi wa Kenya. Kukuza Taarifa za Kuaminika: Mmojawapo wa washirika wetu wa namna hiyo ni Africa Check; asasi iliyoanzishwa mwaka 2012 ikiwa ni asasi ya kwanza inayojitegemea, asasi inayozingatia ukweli pasipo kuegemea upande wowote ikipunguza ukali wa kauli hatarishi, na kuwawezesha watu kujihusisha na habari kwa umakinifu, na kujenga utamaduni wa kuangalia ukweli kote barani Afrika. Tunafurahi kushirikiana na Twitter kama sehemu ya kazi yetu katika uchaguzi nchini Kenya. Ushirikiano huu utatuwezesha kutatua changamoto ya taarifa potofu kwa kuhakiki ukweli wa madai na kutambua uwezekano wa uwepo wa taarifa potofu...Kwa hakika, ushirikiano na Twitter utaongeza matokeo ya mradi wetu wa mafunzo ya vyombo vya habari kwani unatuwezesha kufikia hadhira kubwa zaidi. Afrika Check Independent, nonpartisan fact-checking organisation Kuelekea kwenye Uchaguzi wa Kenya, Africa Check - ambayo ni sehemu ya Fumbua, inaendelea kupambana na simulizi za uongo, kukuza taarifa ambazo ni sahihi na kuwa mstari wa mbele katika ketekeleza kazi muhimu ya kutoa elimu inayofanywa na vyombo vya habari katika ukanda wote. “Tunafurahi kushirikiana na Twitter kama sehemu ya kazi yetu katika uchaguzi nchini Kenya. Ushirikiano huu utatuwezesha kutatua changamoto ya taarifa potofu kwa kuhakiki ukweli wa madai na kutambua uwezekano wa uwepo wa taarifa potofu. Pia, tukielekea kwenye uchaguzi, kwenye jukwaa hili tutaonyesha taarifa ambazo ni sahihi, zilizothibitishwa ili wapiga kura waweze kufanya maamuzi wakiwa na uelewa. Programu za mafunzo ya vyombo vya habari ni mkakati makini unaolenga kupambana na taarifa potofu na kutuwezesha kutumia kazi yetu ya kuhakiki ukweli ili kuwalinda watu dhidi ya taarifa potofu na kuwapatia uwezo wa kuelewa, kuchambua, na kutathmini taarifa kwa umakini badala ya kupokea na kusambaza kila taarifa. Tunaamini kwamba hili linawafanya wafanye maamuzi yanayozingatia ushahidi tunapoelekea kwenye uchaguzi. Kwa hakika, ushirikiano na Twitter utaongeza matokeo ya mradi wetu wa mafunzo ya vyombo vya habari kwani unatuwezesha kufikia hadhira kubwa zaidi.” - Afrika Check Kazi hii ni msingi wa kulinda mazungumzo yanayohusu uchaguzi na tunatarajia kuendelea kushirikiana na kufanya kazi pamoja na Africa Check na asasi zingine tunazoshirikiana nazo, mpaka kuisha kwa uchaguzi na hata baada ya uchaguzi. Uthibitishaji Katika kipindi cha kuelekea Uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022, Twitter imefanya kazi kwa kushirikiana na asasi za Kenya katika kuthibitisha akaunti za Mashirika ya Serikali, Wagombea, Vyama vya Siasa, Asasi za Kiraia (NGOs), Mashirika ya Habari, asasi na watengeneza maudhui. Beji ya Bluu ya Imethibititishwa kwenye Twitter inawafanya watu watambue kuwa akaunti yenye maslahi kwa umma ni ya kweli na hakika - hivyo kuwapa watu waliopo kwenye mtandao wa Twitter muktadha zaidi kuhusu ni akina nani wanazungumza nao ili waweze kubainisha jinsi wanavyojihusisha na akaunti fulani. Kukuza Taarifa za Kuaminika Timu zetu zinafanya kazi kuhakikisha kwamba wapiga kura wa Kenya wanaelekezwa kwenye taarifa sahihi wanapotumia muda wao kwenye jukwaa letu. Ili kuendana na juhudi zetu za kukuza taarifa sahihi, tumeweza kuzindua vipengele vifuatavyo: Emoji ya Kipekee ya Uchaguzi wa Kenya: Tulizindua emoji ya chaguzi za Kenya ambayo inaweza kuwashwa kwa hashtag #KenyaInaamua, #KenyaInaamua2022, #uchaguzike, #uchaguzike2022. Emoji hii maalumu, ambayo inajumuisha sanduku la kupigia kura likiwa limezungushiwa bendera ya Kenya, inalenga kukuza uwezo wa kugundua mazungumzo yanayohusiana na uchaguzi na kuhimiza uzalendo na mchakato wa uchaguzi wa amani. Kichochezi cha Uchaguzi wa Kenya: Tumezindua kichochezi cha uchaguzi kwa kushirikiana na Tume Huru ya Uchaguzi na Mipaka (IEBC) kikiwa katika lugha zote mbili, Kiswahili na Kiingereza. Kichochezi cha utafutaji ni huduma ya arifa ambayo inawaongoza watu walioko Kenya kwenye tovuti ya Tume Huru ya Uchaguzi na Mipaka (IEBC) ambapo Wakenya wataweza kupata taarifa sahihi kuhusu uchaguzi pale watakapotafuta maneno msingi kwenye Twitter, ambayo yanahusiana na Uchaguzi Mkuu wa Kenya. Matukio kwenye Twitter: Timu yetu ya Wasimamizi wa Twitter inauwezesha Uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022 kwa kuunda Matukio (Moments) ya uchaguzi ambayo ni visa vilivyochaguliwa na kupangiliwa ili kutatua changamoto ya taarifa potofu na za uongo kuhusu uchaguzi wa uraisi. Matukio haya ya Twitter, yatajumuisha tarehe muhimu, na miongozo ya jumla ya jinsi ya kushiriki kwenye mchakato wa uchaguzi kutoka kwenye vyanzo vya kuaminika, ikiwemo Tume Huru ya Uchaguzi wa Kenya IEBC, vyombo vya habari na asasi za kuhakiki ukweli. Utekelezaji wa sera Mbali na kutekeleza Sera zetu kuhusu Mienendo ya Chuki na Tabia za Matusi, tumetekeleza Sera ya Uadilifu wa Raia iliyo wazi ili watu wasiweze kutumia huduma za Twitter kwa madhumuni ya kudanganya au kuingilia uchaguzi au michakato mingine ya kiraia. Sera hasa inalenga moja kwa moja aina ya maudhui ambayo ni hatarishi, kama vile (haikomei kwenye) taarifa inayopotosha kuhusu jinsi ya kushiriki kwenye uchaguzi au taarifa inayopotosha ikilenga kutisha au kukatisha tamaa watu wasishiriki kwenye uchaguzi. Kuweka lebo: Ili kuendana na sera hii, tutaweka lebo kwenye Tweets ambazo zinahusisha taarifa za uongo au zinazopotosha ambazo zinapunguza imani ya watu juu ya uchaguzi au taarifa za uongo au zinazopotosha zinazoweza kuathiri matokeo ya uchaguzi. Tweet ambazo zimewekwa chini ya sera hii zitapunguzwa uwezo wa kuonwa na watu (kutokuzwa) kwenye jukwaa letu na zitaleta Matukio kwenye Twitter yenye maudhui yenye taarifa muhimu kuhusu mada hiyo - kwa kuzingatia vyanzo rasmi, vinavyoaminika na wahikiki taarifa. Ushiriki wa ndani Timu yetu ya sera ya Kusini mwa Jangwa la Sahara pia imetoa mafunzo ya usalama na ulinzi kwa asasi tunazoshirikiana nazo, kupitia vitendea kazi kama nyamazisha, funga na toa ripoti, na pia vidokezo tofauti vya usalama na mbinu kama vile uthibitisho wa njia mbili. Timu ya Kenya ya uchaguzi mkuu wa 2022 iliyoanzishwa katika mtandao wa Twitter, itafanya kazi kulinda uadilifu wa mazungumzo yanayohusiana na uchaguzi, kuunga mkono vikundi vya washirika na wawakilishi wa kisiasa pamoja na kutambua na kuzuia tishio lolote la uadilifu wa mazungumzo ya uchaguzi wa Kenya 2022 kwenye Twitter. Tumejitolea kutoa huduma ambayo inakuza na kuwezesha mijadala ya kisiasa na tutaendelea kuimarisha mojawapo ya kipaumbele chetu cha msingi, ambacho ni kulinda mazungumzo ya kisiasa na ya kiraia kwenye Twitter kupitia sera zetu, bidhaa zetu na ushirika muhimu tulionao duniani kote.

Last year we launched the Birdwatch pilot — a new, collaborative way for people to add context to Tweets they believe are misleading. By empowering people to do this together, they can add helpful and informative context for people from different points of view. We’ve made a slew of improvements to Birdwatch based on feedback from contributors, the public, and academic researchers, and we’re seeing promising results. In surveys with randomly sampled people on Twitter in the US, we’ve found: The majority of people found Birdwatch notes (specifically those designated helpful by Birdwatch contributors) helpful. This includes people from across the political spectrum. People in the survey were 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet after reading a note about it, compared to those who saw a Tweet without a note. These are encouraging signs that Birdwatch can be helpful and informative to people on Twitter. That’s why we’re now expanding the visibility of the pilot so we can make additional improvements with feedback from more people on Twitter. Expanding the visibility of Birdwatch Starting today, a small (and randomized) group of people on Twitter in the US will see Birdwatch notes directly on some Tweets. They’ll also be able to rate notes, providing input that will help improve Birdwatch’s ability to add context that is helpful to people from different points of view. To appear on a Tweet, notes first need to be rated helpful by enough Birdwatch contributors from different perspectives. Difference in perspectives is determined by how people have rated notes in the past, not based on demographics. You can learn more about how we assess this here. How we got here When we started a year ago, we set out to build Birdwatch in public, with input from people on Twitter, Birdwatch contributors, academic advisors, and researchers. We made all data contributed to Birdwatch publicly available, along with the code that uses that data to rank notes, and we continue to do so. Feedback and insights from the Twitter community has led to key improvements to Birdwatch: Strengthening the way Birdwatch identifies notes that a diverse set of people find helpful. Doing more to protect contributors and help them feel more comfortable contributing to Birdwatch by rolling out auto-generated aliases for everyone in the pilot. Helping participants understand the impact of their Birdwatch contributions by notifying them if their notes are rated helpful or if notes they rated are elevated. Encouraging participants to include sources and clear explanations in their notes with in-app prompt reminders. Improving the discoverability of notes that need a broader range of feedback by adding a personalized ‘Needs Your Help’ tab for pilot participants. We recently announced a collaboration with the Associated Press and Reuters to help our teams assess the quality of information elevated by Birdwatch participants. We’ve also onboarded an advisory board of scholars and researchers who study misinformation, polarization, online manipulation, and harassment. Advisors are from institutions including MIT, the University of Washington, the University of Michigan School of Information, and more. As online misinformation continues to spread, addressing false or misleading narratives at scale warrants a multi-pronged approach. As a member of the Birdwatch advisory board, I’ve weighed in on its unique approach to explore a community-based tool for adding context to Tweets, including its ranking system to surface the most helpful pieces of context, and I look forward to seeing how this community grows. Amy Zhang Professor, University of Washington We’re thankful for all 10,000 pilot contributors that have played a key role in making Birdwatch what it is today. Along with the time and effort they invest in writing and rating notes, Birdwatch contributors have consistently provided priceless feedback on their Birdwatch experience and shared thoughtful and honest feedback about what's working and what could be better. What’s next We’ll continue to build in the open as we learn, iterate, and expand the pilot.

It’s true: Edit Tweet is being tested by our team internally. The test will then be initially expanded to Twitter Blue subscribers in the coming weeks. Given that this is our most requested feature to date, we wanted to both update you on our progress and give you a heads up that, even if you’re not in a test group, everyone will still be able to see if a Tweet has been edited. So what is Edit Tweet, you ask? Great question. Edit Tweet is a feature that lets people make changes to their Tweet after it’s been published. Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more. For this test, Tweets will be able to be edited a few times in the 30 minutes following their publication. Edited Tweets will appear with an icon, timestamp, and label so it’s clear to readers that the original Tweet has been modified. Tapping the label will take viewers to the Tweet’s Edit History, which includes past versions of the Tweet. For context, the time limit and version history play an important role here. They help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said. Like any new feature, we’re intentionally testing Edit Tweet with a smaller group to help us incorporate feedback while identifying and resolving potential issues. This includes how people might misuse the feature. You can never be too careful. Later this month, we’ll be expanding Edit Tweet access to Twitter Blue subscribers. As part of their subscription, Twitter Blue subscribers receive early access to features and help us test them before they come to Twitter. The test will be localized to a single country at first and expand as we learn and observe how people use Edit Tweet. We’ll also be paying close attention to how the feature impacts the way people read, write, and engage with Tweets. We’re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful.

Overview Twitter’s mission is to serve the public conversation. As part of this mission, we have a zero tolerance approach to combating child sexual exploitation (CSE) on our service. Any content that features or promotes child sexual exploitation (CSE) is prohibited on Twitter. This may include media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated images. Regardless of the intent, viewing, sharing, or linking to child sexual exploitation material contributes to the re-victimisation of the depicted children. This also applies to content that may further contribute to victimisation of children through the promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation. We are actively working to protect children around the world from CSE. We are achieving this via advancing technology solutions, intensive training and support to law enforcement, and expanded education and partnerships. We use a combination of machine learning and human review — our systems are able to surface content to human moderators who use important context to make decisions about potential rule violations. This work is led by an international, cross-functional team with 24-hour coverage and the ability to cover multiple languages. When we are made aware of CSE media, including links to images of or content promoting child exploitation, the material will be removed from the site without further notice and immediately reported to The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (\"NCMEC\"). The latter makes reports available to the appropriate law enforcement agencies around the world to facilitate investigations and prosecutions. NCMEC has strong relationships with law enforcement authorities and NGOs worldwide as well as with the INHOPE network. We also have an appeal process for any potential errors that could occur. For further information on our approach please visit this page and our Transparency Center. --- (1) the type and volumes of data processed; During this reporting period Twitter suspended 532,898 accounts for violating our CSE policy. At this time, Twitter does not track the accounts which are reviewed and not actioned for any policy violations. However, Twitter may review personal information, including account information, text, and media to investigate possible violations of our CSE policy. (2) the specific ground relied on for the processing pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679; Information regarding the grounds for processing relied upon by Twitter are available in our Privacy Policy and our Data Processing materials. (3) the ground relied on for transfers of personal data outside the Union pursuant to Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, where applicable; As outlined in our Privacy Policy, Twitter relies on Standard Contractual Clauses for such transfers. (4) the number of cases of online child sexual abuse identified, differentiating between online child sexual abuse material and solicitation of children; Both types of actions violate Twitter’s CSE Policy, but at this time we are unable to distinguish between online sexual abuse material and the specific context of each peice of material, such as the solicitation of children. However, during this reporting period we suspended 532,898 accounts for violating our CSE Policy. (8) the retention policy and the data protection safeguards applied pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679; The relevant retention periods for data Twitter collects are outlined in our Privacy Policy. Twitter operates a security and privacy programs which comport with the ISO standards and undergo third party audits as needed to ensure the security and the privacy of the data it processes.

Over the past several months, we've been working to bring clarity to the verification eligibility criteria and launched a new policy shaped by public feedback. We also started enforcing that policy by automatically removing the verified badge from accounts that no longer meet the updated criteria for verification, such as those that are inactive or incomplete. We’re grateful for all who participated in our public feedback period and shared ideas for how we can improve verification on Twitter. Today’s application rollout marks the next milestone in our plans to give more transparency, credibility and clarity to verification on Twitter. Below, we share more about this application process and what’s next in our work to help people understand who they’re interacting with on Twitter. What it means to be verified on Twitter The blue badge is one of the ways we help people distinguish the authenticity of accounts that are of high public interest. It gives people on Twitter more context about who they’re having conversations with so they can determine if it’s trustworthy, which our research has shown leads to healthier, more informed conversations. With today’s application launch, we’re also introducing new guidelines for verified accounts on Twitter. These verification guidelines are intended to encourage healthy conversations for the betterment of the Twitter community overall. They follow the philosophy to lead by example, Tweet others how they want to be Tweeted, and serve the public conversation authentically, respectfully, and with consideration. As always, all accounts, including verified accounts, must follow the Twitter Rules. And as we previously shared, verified accounts that repeatedly violate the Twitter Rules are subject to have the blue badge removed. Who’s eligible? To qualify for verification, you must fit the criteria of one of the six categories listed below: Government Companies, brands and organizations News organizations and journalists Entertainment Sports and gaming Activists, organizers, and other influential individuals In addition to the category-specific eligibility criteria outlined in our verification policy, your account must be complete, meaning you have a profile name, a profile image and either a confirmed email address or phone number. Your account must also be active within the last six months and have a record of adherence to the Twitter Rules. You can read more about ineligible accounts in the policy as well. How can you apply to get verified? Over the next few weeks, everyone on Twitter will start to see the new verification application directly in the Account Settings tab. If you don’t see this update immediately today, don’t worry! We're gradually rolling it out to everyone to ensure that we can review applications in a timely manner. Here’s what the application flow will look like: Once you submit your application, you can expect an emailed response from us within a few days, but this could take up to a few weeks depending on how many open applications are in our queue. If your application is approved, you’ll see the blue badge automatically on your profile. If you think we made a mistake, reapply 30 days after receiving our decision on your application. What’s next We know that the current verification policy may not represent all of the people who should be eligible to be verified on Twitter, so we’re planning to introduce more categories later this year, such as those for scientists, academics, and religious leaders. To stay up-to-date with verification, be sure to follow @Verified. We’re also excited to continue expanding the ways people can express themselves on Twitter through their profile and launching new account types. Since our last update, we’ve been doing ongoing research on automated accounts and plan to introduce a way to denote this account type in the next few months, with memorialized accounts to follow. We’re also exploring improvements to the Twitter profile to allow people to better express themselves, such as through an About page. We’ll share more on all of this soon! We look forward to continuing our work to give people more ways to identify and express themselves on Twitter to lead to more informed, healthier conversations."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2021/how-british-telecom-is-leveraging-social-data-qa-with-british-telecom","date":"2021-05-16T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Market Research","Social Intelligence","Social Insights","Social Listening","Voice of the Customer","Insights"],"title":"How British Telecom is leveraging Twitter data","text":"Social data is becoming an increasingly important source of consumer insight for many organizations. British Telecom (BT) has been on a five year journey to better utilize these social insights and so I spoke with Adam Mills, Brand Strategy & Planning Insight Manager, to learn more about their experience and how they are leveraging social intelligence to make better decisions across their business. JR: To start, who’s your favourite Twitter follow? AM: I love @Nigella_Lawson, in particular how she talks and interacts with other people. But my absolute favourite is @rebuildingmcr – there’s something so incredible about looking back at our city through the years and to see how it’s changed and developed. JR: Ah, so not me? AM: Well, um... JR: So let’s kick things off then. Give us some context on your role Adam. AM: I joined BT in 2017 as a brand analyst in the Group Digital Brand team, which supported business units across the organisation. My job was to gather the data needed to support our big digital transformation programmes, whether that was supporting app infrastructure and app consolidation or the group SEO strategy. At about that time our marketing and comms leadership team realized we needed to have a better understanding of what people were saying about us on social and therefore I also took on social listening. Over the next 18 months, social became an increasingly important part of my role, which evolved beyond just social listening to focus on our social capabilities and the infrastructure that supported them. I helped us analyze all the social accounts we maintained across multiple brands and to rethink their purpose. We sought to understand what was strategic and what wasn’t, where to spend and where to pull back. This allowed me to take social listening beyond just listening and to start feeding it into new areas such as NPS and customer experience measurement. I then moved to a new team two years ago but took my role with me as we realized that social insights deserved a formal place within our larger insights function. This was great recognition of our work and the importance of social intelligence to the business. JR: How is BT’s consumer insights team structured and what’s the main focus? AM: About three years ago a new insights director arrived and took a look around and realised that there were pockets of insight scattered across the business with lots of duplication as a result. She decided to bring everyone together under a Centre of Excellence which became a group function allowing it to serve the entire business. We are now a team of 80, broken up into a few teams covering topics such as commercial insights, market and competitive intelligence, brand insight and CX and group performance. Our purpose within the business is to put the customer at the heart of everything that we do, championing the customer at the very heart of decision making. We find ourselves forever overcapacity, which is a blessing and a curse as it shows the organization is getting value from our work, but clearly we need to find ways to scale as we can only do so much. Last year, for example, mid-pandemic we relaunched our internal insights hub and have since had thousands of employees take advantage of it. Next up we want to think more about the new sources of digital insight available to us and how that complements the traditional research methodologies we use. For example, we want to build Brandwatch dashboards connected via our APIs that can deliver real-time social data within our platform providing the right data at the right time to the right people. JR: DIY and agile seem to be the latest buzz words in market research. Has your Centre of Excellence structure allowed you to bring work in-house? AM: Yes and no. Some things we can do in-house and are doing more of. Our NPS program for example is pretty much run entirely in house, which is amazing given the size and the scale of the surveys that we run and the amount of data we collect. But I’d also say no in that there are some projects where we really value our research agency partners' perspectives and want them to challenge our thinking. BT has always been open to accepting that challenge. So while we don’t necessarily run everything in house, in some ways it feels like we do because our research partners are an extension of our team and have supported us for a long time and therefore know us very well. JR: You mentioned NPS. Can you tell us about the program? AM: Sure, we run NPS monthly for our B2C and B2B customers. We relaunched the program a couple of years ago with the messaging that everyone in the business can own and impact this metric, regardless of role or level. We really wanted to emphasize that every customer touchpoint has a direct impact on this metric and therefore we all need to go the extra mile. It’s a core metric for us. JR: What type of research methodologies do you use? AM: It's a mix of qualitative and quantitative. From a qual perspective, we used to do a lot of face to face and focus groups before the lockdowns began and since then we’ve pivoted to virtual focus groups which have been eye-opening, to say the least and have allowed us to expand the types and locations of people we speak with. For example, last week I had a group that had someone from all four nations of the UK, which is the first time I can remember that. So I suspect even when things open up again, the virtual focus groups will be here to stay given their benefits in terms of panel diversity and flexibility. With respect to our quantitative studies, these can take a myriad of different forms from a very standard five minute online survey to a 20-minute in-person survey. We've got experts and specialists across these approaches. JR: And what’s your approach to collecting feedback across the customer journey? AM: We've invested a significant amount into automating feedback collection into our analysis process and therefore our market research engines. Building in customer trigger points is crucial for this, especially in our business where our customers have contracts with us. We think a lot about relationship stages and the right time to trigger various types of requests for feedback as we don’t want to overburden our customers. JR: I’ve read that survey participation rates are in decline. Is BT seeing this? AM: I can only speak about it from the surveys I run which are mainly in the realm of brand tracking, but yes, we’ve seen a significant decline in participation this past year, certainly in B2B more than B2C. It seems pretty understandable to me, given the circumstances of the past 12 months, that people don't want to be glued to their computer screens for any longer than they absolutely have to and don’t want to think about completing surveys. So it is a problem and we are thinking about the things we can do to change that, but certainly, the trend that we are seeing over the past five years is that attention spans are falling through the floor. And I think it's a really interesting dynamic now because you've got a generation of people that are going to be coming through, whether making decisions for themselves or for their companies, who have different approaches to engaging with brands. So, how do you deal with that? How do you build a business that is going to allow you to gain information from your customers in a world like that? And that's when it gets really interesting in my space. How do you build a brand tracking questionnaire that was historically 25 minutes and now needs to be no longer than three and yet still provides the same level of value and insight to the business? It’s a big challenge for sure. JR: Do you believe social can provide unique insight and pick up some of the slack? AM: It certainly adds another dimension to our understanding of customer needs and concerns. The verbatims we capture via surveys provide a lot of context and social for me is so important because it adds colour and context to these verbatims. So for example, if you see a sudden spike in negative NPS responses or brand tracking you can dive into those social comments and understand that there’s been a network outage or perhaps a competitor has launched something new. I can remember a situation a few years back when we had a sudden spike in people complaining about mobile coverage at 10 am in the morning. Upon further analysis, we realized that a local morning television program had invited a money-saving expert as a guest and he told the viewers that if you complain about coverage and prices on a public forum such as Twitter, you might get a better deal. We actually found this out via our competitor monitoring program, as they were also seeing increased traffic. A powerful aspect of social data is the ability to analyze competitors, which we wouldn't have necessarily been able to do within brand tracking or other methods. JR: Can social augment or even replace brand tracking metrics? AM: The engagement our customers have with us on social media tends to be service driven and reactive rather than proactive, and so while it provides really helpful insight into the voice of the customer, it’s been difficult for us to correlate accurately with NPS. That said, we have managed to correlate social conversations with several of our other brand tracking metrics and will continue to look into this more. JR: What’s been BT’s journey with social intelligence to date? AM: It has definitely been a journey. Just before I joined the business in 2017, the group digital brand team was created and was asked to do a complete review of social including output, social care, everything. At that point we had nearly 400 branded social accounts across the group but no coordination in terms of their use of brand guidelines. In addition, some of these accounts had ad spend associated with them while others did not and some used third-party social tools while some published content natively. So in reality there was no consistent, coherent social strategy across the business and no visibility as to what was really going on. We were just sending social posts out into the ether which had the potential to be quite damaging reputationally. So we had to educate our staff on what social could be, the importance of speaking with a unified voice, of measuring in a consistent way and of using the data to help us make better decisions across the business. And thankfully the business bought into the idea that social was so much more than funny cat memes. This allowed us to define a new social strategy with multiple stakeholders which we then launched as part of our B2C brand refresh in October 2019. We came out the back of this work with 12 strategic social accounts, all of which now had proper funding, performance management and KPIs. The reason I tell you all of this is that a lot of the work we've done over the last four years has allowed us to build an understanding of 1) what social insight and social data can do and 2) how that links with digital insight and 3) how it provides a real time voice of the customer. It will never replace qualitative focus groups, if you want robust and reliable data you have to go with focus groups, but it can provide directional accuracy. People really started understanding the value of this when we stopped describing it as social listening and instead as the world’s largest focus group. This change of language helped people make the connection to the world of research, making it more reputable. JR: Your team has many research methodologies at their disposal to get at consumer opinion. Where does social data fit into this and how is it being used today? AM: Even after the strides we’ve made the past few years, we are still at the very beginning of our work with social data. We’ve gone from just six users of social listening to over 400 staff who now have access to several social solutions depending on their role. So as we get more familiar with social data we’ll be able to do much more. But as for today, we lean on social data to help us do a great many things. Reputational insight for example is proving hugely valuable for us. We are also working with our customer care team on proactive care where there is a big opportunity to prevent churn and improve overall brand sentiment. We’re using social data to help with network outage detection and communication. We’re using it for audience analysis and to better understand how distinct groups think about our products. And finally, we are starting to use logo and image analysis as one input to identify sponsorship opportunities. So as you can see, a variety of use cases that add value across the business. JR: Final question then...what’s Twitter data’s superpower? AM: Its spontaneity, its real-time nature. The fact that it’s not forced, but unsolicited. People speak differently on social than they do to researchers so it provides a different way to understand consumers and their needs. JR: Many thanks for your time today Adam!"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-tips","date":"2021-05-05T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Introducing Tips","text":"We $ee you – sharing your PayPal link after your Tweet goes viral, adding your $Cashtag to your profile so people can support your work, dropping your Venmo handle on your birthday or if you just need some extra help.

That’s why in 2020, we tested prompts that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially harmful or offensive reply before they hit send. Based on feedback and learnings from those tests, we’ve made improvements to the systems that decide when and how these reminders are sent. Starting today, we’re rolling these improved prompts out across iOS and Android, starting with accounts that have enabled English-language settings. How we got here We began testing prompts last year that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially harmful or offensive reply — such as insults, strong language, or hateful remarks — before Tweeting it. Once prompted, people had an opportunity to take a moment and make edits, delete, or send the reply as is. In early tests, people were sometimes prompted unnecessarily because the algorithms powering the prompts struggled to capture the nuance in many conversations and often didn't differentiate between potentially offensive language, sarcasm, and friendly banter. Throughout the experiment process, we analyzed results, collected feedback from the public, and worked to address our errors, including detection inconsistencies. These tests ultimately resulted in people sending less potentially offensive replies across the service, and improved behavior on Twitter. We learned that: If prompted, 34% of people revised their initial reply or decided to not send their reply at all. After being prompted once, people composed, on average, 11% fewer offensive replies in the future. If prompted, people were less likely to receive offensive and harmful replies back. Since the early tests, here’s what we’ve incorporated into the systems that decide when and how to send these reminders: Consideration of the nature of the relationship between the author and replier, including how often they interact. For example, if two accounts follow and reply to each other often, there’s a higher likelihood that they have a better understanding of preferred tone of communication. Adjustments to our technology to better account for situations in which language may be reclaimed by underrepresented communities and used in non-harmful ways. Improvement to our technology to more accurately detect strong language, including profanity. Created an easier way for people to let us know if they found the prompt helpful or relevant. What’s next We’ll continue to explore how prompts — such as reply prompts and article prompts — and other forms of intervention can encourage healthier conversations on Twitter. Our teams will also collect feedback from people on Twitter who have received reply prompts as we expand this feature to other languages. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to learn and make new improvements to encourage more meaningful conversations on Twitter."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/i-wish-i-knew-podcast","date":"2021-05-03T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Official Twitter Blog","Company"],"title":"Introducing I Wish I Knew, a @TwitterResearch podcast","text":"We’re excited to introduce I Wish I Knew, a new podcast that brings you directly into the world of @TwitterResearch.

If Twitter is where so much of this conversation lives, it should be easier and simpler to read the content that drives it. That’s why we’re excited to announce that Twitter is acquiring Scroll. Scroll has built a way to read articles without the ads, pop-ups, and other clutter that get in the way, cleaning up the reading experience and giving people what they want: just the content. Meanwhile, publishers who work with Scroll can bring in more revenue than they would from traditional ads on a page. It’s a better Internet for readers and for writers. This is an exciting opportunity for us to introduce this proven model to publishers on our service and make reading the news better for everyone involved. Looking ahead, Scroll will become a meaningful addition to our subscriptions work as we build and shape a future subscription service on Twitter. Improving the reader experience Those who create and consume news know that reading – and more broadly, journalism – deserve a better future. Scroll will help us build that future, solving one of the most frustrating parts about reading content online. We want to reimagine what they’ve built to deliver a seamless reading experience to our hyper-engaged audiences and allow publishers to deliver cleaner content that can make them more money than today’s business models. To do this, we plan to include Scroll as part of an upcoming subscription offering we’re currently exploring. As a Twitter subscriber, picture getting access to premium features where you can easily read articles from your favorite news outlet or a writer’s newsletter from Revue, with a portion of your subscription going to the publishers and writers creating the content. What’s next for Scroll Scroll will temporarily pause new sign-ups. Following the acquisition, we’ll be working to include their product into our subscription plans and prepare to grow Scroll’s publisher network. We’ll keep supporting the existing community of customers and publishers on Scroll, and new publishers interested in joining Scroll can sign up on their website for the latest updates.

Today, I want to talk about Spaces, our live audio conversation feature on Twitter. We’re progressively rolling Spaces out to more people, and we want to share where we are on our journey to make this feature more accessible. The Spaces team has been working in the open, in full view of the world, since December 2020. The ongoing conversation around Spaces accessibility both internally and on Twitter has helped us identify and address accessibility gaps in the product. By working in the open, we’re showing you our ideas, our works in progress, and areas for improvement. Twitter is becoming a more accessible company and product in real-time. Folks who are deaf, hard of hearing (HoH), or prefer the support of captioning for audio, will be able to turn on captions and follow along with conversations. Every element in Spaces has an accessible label, so people using assistive technology will know what every button does, and what actions are available. Captions are incredibly important for Spaces, so we’re going to make them as accurate and versatile as possible. Here are some of the things we’ll be working on first: Improve accuracy and synchronization of captions with audio Provide scrollback and enable pausing Improve support for multiple speakers speaking synchronously Customization of captions appearance (e.g., font color, size, background, etc.) Remove the requirement for the Speaker to enable captions on iOS. (They’re automatic on Android because of the difference in caption service provider.) Explore ways to improve automatic captioning algorithm and minimize inaccuracies Explore options for increased language support Match accessibility system settings (larger fonts, display, etc.) Present emoji reactions via assistive technologies Explore options for multi-modal participation beyond speech, such as text input mode As James Loduca, our Senior Director of Global Inclusion and Diversity, has said, “We’re on a journey, and we’re closer to the beginning than we are to the end.” Our teams are working hard to make Twitter more accessible, and we have a long way to go. We’re learning as we build, and we’re committed to getting better. Continue to ask questions and hold us accountable.

Since then, we’ve been building and testing with a limited group, and have found that hearing people’s voices bring conversations on Twitter to life in a completely new way. Since we’ve been building this, the ability to create a Space has become available to millions of people, and we’ve continued to make improvements based on your feedback. Today, we’re bringing the ability to host a Space to all accounts with 600 or more followers on Twitter. Based on what we’ve learned so far, these accounts are likely to have a good experience hosting live conversations because of their existing audience. Before bringing the ability to create a Space to everyone, we’re focused on learning more, making it easier to discover Spaces, and helping people enjoy them with a great audience. People already come to Twitter to talk about what’s happening. You’ve always followed people for their Tweets, now Spaces lets you hear their voices and talk about what’s happening now and what’s most important to you – live. From Tweeting to talking, reading to listening, Spaces encourages and unlocks real, open conversations on Twitter with the authenticity and nuance, depth and power only the human voice can bring. Spaces are for small and intimate conversations with just a few others, or for big discussions about what’s unfolding right now with thousands of listeners. From connecting to your favorite musician to a post show about the game or a recap of news that just dropped, dig into the topics and conversations you care about with people you know and people you want to know. So how do you join or create a Space? Glad you asked. How Spaces work On Twitter for iOS and Android, when someone you follow starts or speaks in a Space, it’ll appear at the top of your timeline as a purple bubble for as long as it’s live. When you join a Space as a listener, you can react to what you hear with emojis, check out any pinned Tweets, follow along with captions, Tweet or DM the Space, or request to speak. When you join a Space as a speaker, in addition to talking, you can pin Tweets to the Space, turn on captions so everyone can follow along with what you’re saying, and Tweet the Space so your followers can join. When you create a Space, you’re in control – who’s speaking, the topics, and the vibe. Invite people to join by Tweeting or DM’ing them to jump in and then invite them to speak directly from your Space. From there, talk about whatever is happening in your world. It’s important to us that people feel safe hosting and participating in Spaces conversations – that’s why we’ve built in safety controls available to hosts and speakers. For example, as a host, you can mute speakers and take away their mic, or remove them from the Space completely. Recently, we added the ability for Hosts to mute all speakers at the same time and a new management page for easier hosting. Anyone can report and block others in the Space, or report the Space. Also, people you’ve blocked can’t join a Space you’re hosting, and you’ll see labels and warnings if someone you’ve blocked is speaking in a Space you join. You can learn more about how Spaces work here. Your Feedback + What’s Next Your feedback has been key in helping us build and improve Spaces over the past several months. We’ve been testing and building in the open with you via @TwitterSpaces, because we’re interested in incorporating your feedback early and often. For example, you told us you wanted more audience management controls, so we built them. You told us you wanted a way to show you are laughing during a Space, so we added an 😂 emoji. Here’s more of what’s coming, based on your feedback: Ticketed Spaces. Hosts put time and effort into creating space for conversation, connection and fun. Now, we're working on a way for hosts to be rewarded for the experiences they create by getting monetary support, while providing listeners with exclusive access to the conversations they care about most. Hosts can set ticket prices and how many are available to sell. A limited group will be able to host Ticketed Spaces in the coming months. Hosts earn the majority of the revenue from ticket sales and Twitter will keep a small amount as well. Schedule and set reminders. To make it easy to track what’s happening and when, you’ll also be able to schedule and set reminders for upcoming Spaces in the coming weeks. This way, people don’t miss hearing from their faves. Host with others. Co-hosting with other people to help manage speakers, participants, and if you need to leave, to pass hosting to one of your co-hosts. Better accessibility. Improvements to live captions so they can be paused, customized, and are more accurate. More about our work to make Spaces accessible for everyone here. More ways to find Spaces. More ways to find and drop into Spaces across Twitter – join a Space from a purple bubble around someone’s profile picture in your Home timeline when they’re live. We’re testing this now. Spaces is where live audio conversations happen. And it’s just getting started. Listen up, stay tuned and let us know what you think @TwitterSpaces. We like how it’s shaping up, but there is much more to come."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/wpfd-2021","date":"2021-05-02T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Supporting local journalists on #WorldPressFreedomDay","text":"Today Twitter is proud to mark World Press Freedom Day, an annual reminder of our shared responsibility to support and advocate for a free press around the world. As journalists continue to selflessly report from the front lines of conflicts, in the face of hostile interests, and, especially during this past year, risk their personal health to cover a global pandemic, we believe it is pivotal that they and their industry are supported. To that end, Twitter is launching a campaign to spotlight, elevate and support local journalism — which is a vital resource for communities around the world, especially now for people seeking COVID-19 information. Below we’ve outlined what we’re doing, and how you can get involved: #FollowLocalJournalists on Twitter We’ve organized a global day of action on Twitter on May 3rd centered around the hashtag #FollowLocalJournalists. We’re encouraging everyone — prominent national reporters, journalism advocacy organizations, and everyday passionate news consumers — to share impactful examples of local journalism and elevate the reporters who contributed to it. The goal is to spotlight these reporters’ work and increase their audience. Local Newspaper Ad Campaign Twitter is running an ad campaign in 28 local newspapers across the United States, including The Detroit Free Press, The Des Moines Register, The Miami Herald, and The Kansas City Star to support these outlets and amplify the #FollowLocalJournalists initiative. The ads, which will run in print and online, will direct readers to Twitter Lists of journalists created by each newspaper and by Twitter. Tune in on Spaces Twitter has organized Twitter Spaces around the world where people will be able to hear directly from journalists about the issues facing their industry, including: In the Philippines, journalists from Rappler will host a Space focused on the idea that “When journalists can’t ask, we can’t act.” In Myanmar, the @ViceWorldNews team based across Southeast Asia will bring a group of Burmese journalists together to talk about #whatshappeninginmyanmar in the aftermath of the bloody coup there, and how so many journalists are risking their lives and freedom to tell this story. In India, with journalists reporting from the frontlines of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, newsrooms are facing incredible challenges. To discuss the impact of this crisis on the media, Twitter is hosting a Space for senior editors from across the country (Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Guwahati) in conversation with the Twitter India news team. In Japan, @TwitterNewsJP is hosting two Spaces with journalists to discuss ways to support the needs of local news outlets, and the state of journalism nationally. In Thailand, Sutichai Yoon is hosting a Space with local journalists to discuss what inspires and challenges them and how social media has impacted their work. In Brazil, @Abraji and @RSF_pt is hosting a Space with five local journalism organizations focused on the state of journalism in Brazil. Partnership with UNESCO and NGOs working on protecting journalists Twitter has also continued our partnership with UNESCO this year to help drive conversation around World Press Freedom Day. We were proud to attend Asia Pacific Regional Consultation for World Press Freedom Day 2021 to discuss our commitment to a free press, and join UNESCO and global experts to discuss the role of technology in promoting media and information literacy. Together, we also launched Twitter emojis for the hashtags #FollowLocalJournalists, #WorldPressFreedomDay, #PressFreedom and #WPFD2021 in 20 languages. Additionally, as a part of our commitment to freedom of expression and an open internet, we’ve provided trainings and Ads for good grants to non-profit organizations such as Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters sans frontière, Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, Engage Media, and PEN America. Throughout the year, #FollowLocalJournalists will be the theme of @TwitterNews’ events, trainings and advocacy work. Our commitment to strengthening and supporting a free press is year-round, so please follow @TwitterNews for updates on initiatives that support local journalism."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2021/survey-fatigue-is-real-insight-from-twitter-can-help","date":"2021-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Social Insights","Social Listening","Voice of the Customer","Insights"],"title":"Survey fatigue is real, insight from Twitter can help","text":"\"Survey finds 95% of people don't like taking surveys,\" could be the headline of your favourite satirical website, which wouldn't be far from the truth. Overwhelmed by the increasing number of requests for feedback, consumers are avoiding surveys all together which is impacting response rates. The telephone survey, for example, has seen a steep decline in response rates since the mid-90s, dropping from 36% in 1997 to just 6% in 2018, according to Pew Research1. Of course, many variables are at play when it comes to response rates across different types of surveys, but the reality is that survey fatigue is real and it impacts both the volume and quality of feedback received. The insight they provide is also limited to the questions asked. So, is there another way? I recently ran an experiment to understand if insights from Tweets could answer many of the same questions that customer surveys commonly ask. To do this I chose a consumer-focused industry⁠—airline travel⁠—and focused on a specific carrier (who shall remain anonymous). Given the disruption to the industry brought on by COVID-19, I chose to analyse the month of January 2020, as this was one of the last few months of unaffected travel. In January 2020 alone, the airline was mentioned 70,000 times on Twitter which provided a large amount of content to sift through. In particular, I was looking for Tweets from travellers sharing their preflight, inflight and postflight experiences and was guided by the topics that bubbled to the surface organically. Here are some examples of what I found: Preflight Experience Check-in: 567 mentions including app check-in, visa checks and bag drop Lounge: 443 mentions including food quality, shower cleanliness and staffing Boarding: 223 mentions including express boarding and shuttle buses Inflight Experience WiFi: 34 mentions of connectivity issues or lack of service Entertainment system: 27 mentions of small or dirty video screens Food quality: 372 mentions including lack of vegan options, pricing and selection Postflight Experience Baggage collection: 374 mentions including delayed, lost and damaged baggage Loyalty program: 438 mentions of air mile collection and usage policies Compensation claims: 131 mentions of confusing rules These comments alone constituted nearly 2,600 pieces of customer feedback covering the entire customer journey⁠—insights that the airline could potentially use to improve the experience for all passengers. Crucially, they uncovered specific pieces of feedback that might not normally be surfaced by surveys due to the limitations of the questions asked. For example: Departures check-in: One person lamented that her elderly parent struggled to follow the prompts on the check-in kiosks. Onboard WiFi purchase: One traveller asked why there was no pay-as-you-go option. Onboard electrical plugs: Several travellers mentioned the placement and number of electrical plugs and some even provided suggestions on where they should be placed. Meal choices: Several passengers expressed their annoyance that gluten-free meal options had to be pre-ordered. This analysis did not attempt to create a representative sample of customer views nor to draw any type of causal relationship between these comments and overall satisfaction with the airline. I simply set out to prove that the breadth and depth of conversations happening on Twitter can provide a real-time voice of the customer at every touchpoint in the customer journey. The findings suggest that insights from Twitter can indeed shed light on many facets of the customer experience, providing a unique window into real observed human behaviours with several advantages over traditional insight gathering techniques. First, the unsolicited nature of Twitter feedback circumvents one of the biggest challenges of research—the introduction of bias by the questions being asked. Secondly, as Tweets are sent at the moment people are actually having the experience, they tend to be more emotive as a result and represent a more authentic view of a customer’s true feelings. This is much different than being asked to recount your experience with the onboard WiFi a few days later via an email prompted survey. At that point, the moment is gone and you might not even bother to respond. This strength of social data should not be underestimated, for very little market research delivered today is conducted with the context in mind. And finally, the open, continuous nature of Twitter allows you to see trends emerge over time and benchmark yourself against your competitors. It also has the advantage of allowing you to go back and analyze a topic retrospectively, uncovering feedback preserved in time, forever. Customer experience measurement has come a long way over the past few years as new technologies and techniques have emerged to ascertain consumers’ true feelings. The reality is that it’s not just one approach that will provide the insight organizations need but rather a combination of many, used at the right time and leveraging their respective data gathering strengths. Insights from Twitter won’t fully replace surveys, but they can complement them, providing context to common metrics such as NPS while helping to focus the questions you do want to ask of your customers. Perhaps Twitter’s greatest strength then is in providing answers to the questions you didn’t even think to ask.

I recently spoke with her about the evolution of social intelligence within organizations and what the most successful ones are getting right. Joe: To start, who’s your favorite Twitter follow? Jillian: Generally, I love following Scottish Twitter, it’s very funny! My favourite account is Daily Overview (@DOverview) where you view the world looking down from the sky. It’s beautiful. Joe: Tell us about the history of The SILab and where the idea came from? Jillian: All of this started off as a passion project for me. I was in Scotland doing my PhD on social media and looking to connect with others with an interest in the space. This was 2018 and I found that people in the research and insights industry didn't understand it properly and treated social insights with a bit of skepticism. But I kept looking and interestingly enough, I found that there was quite a community of practitioners out there, but they weren't connected. So, the whole premise of the Social Intelligence Lab was to bring these people together to further our knowledge of this emerging source of insight. Key to this was it being driven by the practitioners themselves and not the vendors who would have their own agenda. Joe: We first met in the autumn of 2018 at your conference which was probably the first dedicated to this idea of social intelligence. Has it since matured and spread as much as you had hoped? Jillian: The idea that organizations need to be aware of signals from social media data is quite mainstream these days, however in many cases it’s not true social intelligence but rather a narrower focus on using social data to better optimize your social media marketing strategy. This is a legitimate use case of course, but it misses out on the value social data brings to making better decisions across the organization. If you are not doing that, and just tracking mentions, then you are just doing social listening. Joe: What is your definition of social intelligence by the way? Jillian: Social intelligence is the analysis of digital conversations to answer questions, test hypotheses or find insights that can be used to guide decision making. It has recently morphed into consumer intelligence or digital consumer intelligence, which I would say is an effort by the tech companies to differentiate their products as they begin to explore a wider variety of data sources rather than being a whole new discipline. Most practitioners would typically use these data sources anyway. If you Google ‘social intelligence’ you'll get a lot of links to do with emotional intelligence, which is quite interesting to me because I think they're very similar. A real strength of social data is the ability to understand people’s authentic emotions on a topic. Joe: Covid and the ensuing lockdowns were a big shock to the consumer insights industry forcing many to pivot their opinion gathering techniques. Do you think this experience has opened the industry’s eyes to the value of social insights? Jillian: I think it has, but the bigger issue is the ability to get the work done successfully. I know of several brands that went out and procured new solutions to help them gather social insights but once they had them, realized they couldn’t use them because they lacked the expertise to get value from these solutions. This highlights the skills gap that exists and probably also highlights why the specialist social intelligence agencies are doing so well: brands can’t do this analysis work themselves and are having to outsource it. All the specialist agencies we work with have reported dramatic increases in their work and are hiring staff to keep up. Joe: Can you talk more about the skills gap you mentioned? Jillian: Social listening solutions are often billed as DIY insight tools with this idea that you can give it to anybody in the organization, train them up and off they go. This democratization of social data certainly sounds great in theory, but we know from the more mature, advanced organizations that this approach of onboarding half the company on a tool doesn’t work, and what you need to democratize instead is the insights. And that’s because it's time consuming to cleanse and segment data and interpret the findings in a meaningful way. It’s certainly not for a novice to do or someone who is only logging-in once a week to take a quick look at a dashboard. Joe: You’re therefore arguing for a ‘Centre of Excellence’ that can feed different parts of the organization with social insights tailored to their specific needs? Jillian: Yes, definitely. We are seeing many enterprise organizations building out listening teams or social intelligence teams that often are part of the org’s broader insights function. Their job is to embed themselves into specific business units or departments delivering social insights to those teams and educating them on the kinds of problems or questions that social data can answer. It’s one part delivery and another part education. Joe: What’s a best practice for getting this set up? Jillian: Many organizations’ success has started with their senior leadership promoting the importance of not just social intelligence, but data driven decision making, of which social data is one part. Your interview with Adam Mills highlighting British Telecom’s journey is a great example. I’d also say that a vast majority of the time, when an organization is investing in social data heavily, it’s because social insights helped them come through some sort of crisis where it provided a real-time pulse of what was happening that they couldn’t get anywhere else. Utilizing this type of experience to your advantage is important. We’ve also seen organizations grow internal adoption by sending daily briefings customized to specific departments and personas. This makes it more tangible, and people get interested. Joe: You mentioned that more and more organizations are seeing the value in insights from social data. What’s keeping it from being used more consistently in market research? Jillian: I think a big part of it is in the data access models available to market researchers. Most of the social listening solutions have historically required a year-long contract which doesn’t always fit well with the episodic, project-based world of market researchers who may only need access for a few weeks at a time. More flexible consumption models would certainly make it easier for them to access the data they need. Another challenge is that most of the solutions haven’t been built with market researchers in mind. They [market researchers] tend to want to get the data out of the solution so they can create their own code frames and segmentations and that’s not particularly easy. I do see it improving however as the listening solutions see a huge growth opportunity in market research. Joe: On that point of technology, text and image analytics have come a long way in just the past few years. Are these advances the missing link allowing new personas to unlock more insight across new use cases? Jillian: There has been technological development in the area, but it is not the technology that unlocks the value. We’re not in a place yet where having the technology is going to be the missing link and I’d argue that we should never sell social intelligence in this way. Businesses need to invest in skills, the experts with social insight experience. It is these people who are going to unlock more insight and use cases across the organization. We need to identify the use cases and questions where social data can support the business, not be led by new functionality in technology to tell us what we should be doing. If we look at image analysis, there is huge potential for insights here but if you speak to a semiotician they would say the tech does not help them gain insights from the data easily. I think this is the main reason organizations are struggling to make visual listening work for them, as just one example. Joe: Final question then...what’s Twitter data’s superpower? Jillian: In wider society, it's the surfacing of cultural trends, meaning what big trends are becoming important. Your cultural trends report is always a good read. At a brand level, it’s customer experience - instead of looking at cx data at the individual level, go macro and you can learn a lot. Joe: Many thanks for your time today, Jillian!

This includes threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so. There are growing concerns about the misuse of media and information that is not available elsewhere online as a tool to harass, intimidate, and reveal the identities of individuals. Sharing personal media, such as images or videos, can potentially violate a person’s privacy, and may lead to emotional or physical harm. The misuse of private media can affect everyone, but can have a disproportionate effect on women, activists, dissidents, and members of minority communities. When we receive a report that a Tweet contains unauthorized private media, we will now take action in line with our range of enforcement options. While our existing policies and Twitter Rules cover explicit instances of abusive behavior, this update will allow us to take action on media that is shared without any explicit abusive content, provided it’s posted without the consent of the person depicted. This is a part of our ongoing work to align our safety policies with human rights standards, and it will be enforced globally starting today. What is in violation of this policy? Under our private information policy, you can’t share the following types of private information or media, without the permission of the person who it belongs to: home address or physical location information, including street addresses, GPS coordinates or other identifying information related to locations that are considered private; identity documents, including government-issued IDs and social security or other national identity numbers – note: we may make limited exceptions in regions where this information is not considered to be private; contact information, including non-public personal phone numbers or email addresses; financial account information, including bank account and credit card details; and other private information, including biometric data or medical records. NEW: media of private individuals without the permission of the person(s) depicted. The following behaviors are also not permitted: threatening to publicly expose someone’s private information; sharing information that would enable individuals to hack or gain access to someone’s private information without their consent,e.g., sharing sign-in credentials for online banking services; asking for or offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for posting someone’s private information; asking for a bounty or financial reward in exchange for not posting someone’s private information, sometimes referred to as blackmail. When private information or media has been shared on Twitter, we need a first-person report or a report from an authorized representative in order to make the determination that the image or video has been shared without their permission. Learn more about reporting on Twitter. Sharing private media When we are notified by individuals depicted, or by an authorized representative, that they did not consent to having their private image or video shared, we will remove it. This policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or individuals when media and accompanying Tweet text are shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse. However, if the purpose of the dissemination of private images of public figures or individuals who are part of public conversations is to harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence them, we may remove the content in line with our policy against abusive behavior.. Similarly, private nude images of public individuals will continue to be actioned under our non-consensual nudity policy. We recognize that there are instances where account holders may share images or videos of private individuals in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation, such as in the aftermath of a violent event, or as part of a newsworthy event due to public interest value, and this might outweigh the safety risks to a person. We will always try to assess the context in which the content is shared and, in such cases, we may allow the images or videos to remain on the service. For instance, we would take into consideration whether the image is publicly available and/or is being covered by mainstream/traditional media (newspapers, TV channels, online news sites), or if a particular image and the accompanying tweet text adds value to the public discourse, is being shared in public interest, or is relevant to the community. Feeling safe on Twitter is different for everyone, and our teams are constantly working to understand and address these needs. We know our work will never be done, and we will continue to invest in making our product and policies more robust and transparent to continue to earn the trust of the people using our service."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/stronger-security-for-your-twitter-account","date":"2021-01-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Security","Product"],"title":"Stronger security for your Twitter account","text":"Keeping people safe and secure on Twitter is one of our top priorities, and we’re committed to helping people understand the security tools we offer and how to use them. Starting today, people on Twitter have the option to use security keys as their only form of two-factor authentication (2FA), which is the most effective way to keep your Twitter account secure. While any form of 2FA is better than no 2FA, physical security keys are the most effective. Security keys are small devices that act like keys to your house. Just as you need a physical key to unlock the door to your home, you need a security key to unlock access to your account. Security keys offer the strongest protection for your Twitter account because they have built-in protections to ensure that even if a key is used on a phishing site, the information shared can’t be used to access your account. They use the FIDO and WebAuthn security standards to transfer the burden of protecting against phishing attempts from a human to a hardware device. Security keys can differentiate legitimate sites from malicious ones and block phishing attempts that SMS or verification codes would not. Twitter has long encouraged the use of some form of 2FA. In 2018, we added the option to use security keys as one of several 2FA options. However, this initial support only worked for Twitter.com, not the mobile app, and required accounts to have another form of 2FA enabled as well. In 2019, we upgraded our security key support to use the latest WebAuthn standard, which provides an up-to-date and secure authentication method recognized across the web. We also enabled the ability to use 2FA on a Twitter account without requiring a phone number, allowing people to protect their accounts from SIM-swapping attacks and opening up 2FA to more people. In 2020, we made additional improvements by enabling support for security keys on iOS and Android, in addition to the web. And earlier this year, we added the ability to register multiple security keys on your Twitter account, allowing you to have backup security keys and making it easier for accounts managed by multiple people to enable 2FA with multiple security keys. Today, we’re adding the option to use security keys as your sole 2FA method — meaning you can enroll one or more security keys as the only form of 2FA on your Twitter account without a backup 2FA method. We know this is important to people because not everyone is able to have a backup 2FA method or wants to share their phone number with us. With this update, we want everyone to feel empowered to enable security keys to better secure their Twitter account. We’ll continue to make updates and improvements to the ways you can keep your Twitter account secure."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/imperfect-by-design","date":"2021-01-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Branding","Brands","Design","Marketing","Company"],"title":"Imperfect, by design","text":"And it’s been an amazing journey. Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how we got here… We wanted an art-first approach to our brand identity that encompassed emotion and expression. So rather than build the system up from each component part or build around a specific element, we embarked upon building a creative design system that’s intentionally imperfect. Instead of working with some of the larger, more well-known companies, we reached out to @AtelierIrradie in Paris. They had a global perspective, a portfolio of fashion and beauty, and a design aesthetic that we knew was right for what we wanted to do. They were great partners, and captured the attitude, vibe, and energy of Twitter. Expression and emotion vary depending upon topic, mood, locale, or simply the tilt of the sun; our system allows for that range. We can turn up or down the expressiveness of the brand based upon the situation or conversation. The work... ...is ripped. Torn. Bold. Digital. Layered. And courageous. It has energy and motion. Tears are used to reveal information or to focus on something. Layers and textures represent the constant stream of overlapping and intersecting conversation. The use of color that POPS conveys humor, intensity, and authenticity. And we ground everything in our iconic logo, Twitter blue, AND Tweets. Because words matter. We worked with @grillitype in Switzerland to develop Chirp, our first-ever proprietary typeface. Chirp strikes the balance between messy and sharp to amplify the fun and irreverence of a Tweet, but can also carry the weight of seriousness when needed. To get there we blended American Gothic and European Grotesque styles, adding specific handmade quirks of early woodcut specimens. This gives us a versatile and contemporary family with international sensibilities. We’re in the process of extending Chirp to languages beyond the Latin alphabet. Finally, the core of our product isn’t changing, we’re just changing how we show up. We feel this work is the truest form and reflection of who we are as a company and what our service represents.

As of June 2022, Shop Spotlight is now available to all merchants in the US. Last updated: July 25, 2022. Remember 2015? The timeline was divided about the true color of this dress. We got our first up close look at Pluto. Culottes were cool. And at Twitter, we were in the early stages of exploring shopping on Twitter with features like the “Buy Now” button, product pages and product collections. We eventually stepped back from our shopping pursuits to focus on other areas. Now, as you heard from us earlier this year, we’re back and putting more energy into testing out the potential for shopping on Twitter. As one of our first steps forward, today, we’re launching a pilot of the Shop Spotlight -- a feature that allows us to explore how shoppable profiles can create a pathway from talking about and discovering products on Twitter to actually purchasing them. The Shop Spotlight is a dedicated space at the top of a profile where businesses can showcase their products. When people visit a profile with the Shop Spotlight enabled, they can scroll through the carousel of products and tap through on a single product to learn more and purchase -- seamlessly in an in-app browser, without having to leave Twitter. We’re starting small with a handful of brands in the United States. People in the U.S. who use Twitter in English on iOS and Android devices will be able to see the Shop Spotlight. We believe in the power of the conversations that Twitter facilitates around products. With this pilot, we’ll get to explore how our engaged, responsive and chatty audience reacts to products that are emotionally charged -- like a new jersey from your favorite sports team -- or that provide lasting impact -- like a new skincare regimen. And, fundamentally, it’ll give us the chance to keep learning about which shopping experiences people prefer on Twitter. As we learn, we’re creating deeper partnerships with businesses that reflect whom we’re building for with a new Merchant Advisory Board. The board will consist of brands that have established themselves as best-in-class examples of merchants on Twitter. With their partnership, we hope to more easily address the needs of businesses of any size or vertical in our product innovation. While the Shop Spotlight is a step in better-supporting shopping on Twitter, it also builds upon our efforts around Professional Profiles, which we started introducing earlier this year. With modular components for Professional Profiles, businesses across the globe – from small businesses and legacy brands to creator-founded businesses – will have access to customized profiles with features intended to help drive engagement and business outcomes. Stay tuned. Though we are in very early explorations, we’re excited about the potential of shopping on Twitter and eager to learn more as we go."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2021/how-to-hear-the-real-voice-of-the-customer","date":"2021-01-27T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Social Intelligence","Social Listening","Voice of the Customer","Market Research","Customer Care","Insights"],"title":"Listening to the real voice of the customer on Twitter","text":"The oldest documented customer complaint wasn’t in response to a request for feedback but rather an unsolicited salvo against a perceived injustice. Dating from around 1750 BC in Mesopotamia, the small clay tablet describes how a man named Nanni was delivered the wrong grade of copper ore from a merchant named Ea-nasir. And Nanni wasn’t happy, writing in a now extinct East Semitic language, “What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt?”1 We unfortunately don’t know how or if Nanni’s complaint was ever addressed, but this ancient artifact does highlight that as a species we’ve been complaining for a very long time. Today we call feedback like Nanni’s customer experience, a term that has taken on many meanings recently. At its most basic, customer experience (CX) is the combination of all the interactions or touchpoints an organisation has with its customers. And it’s a relatively new phenomenon, for it wasn’t until the mid-20th century, with the rise of consumerism, that businesses started to take customer experience seriously as a way to differentiate themselves from the competition. And as these newly empowered consumers now had many choices, businesses realized they needed to do a better job of understanding their customers’ preferences and needs. This led to the birth of the market research industry and of various data collection techniques to capture consumer opinion and feedback. Today, we have an abundance of research methodologies, data analysis techniques and measures such as NPS and CSAT, but, by and large, customer experience programs are built on feedback collection methods that are 50+ years old. Forrester recently found that an astonishing 70% of organizations rely solely on surveys for customer feedback and a large percentage of these are email surveys.2 Ask yourself, when was the last time you actually completed one? People are inundated with survey requests these days resulting in low participation rates which ultimately leads to poor data and a lack of customer insight. To try and remedy this survey fatigue, organizations are increasingly incentivizing participation. There’s certainly nothing wrong with this, peoples’ time is valuable and should be compensated, however the introduction of incentives has led to fraud driven by ‘professional’ responders as well as the plague of distributed survey farms and bots. As a result, data quality is suffering. So, is there another way? The good news is, people haven’t stopped sharing their experiences and opinions, in fact, they’re doing so now more than ever, they’re just doing it in different places. And this is increasingly in the apps and social networks where they’re already spending considerable time. The customer care component of CX has seen massive growth on Twitter throughout the pandemic as stores shuttered and phone lines were clogged. However, it’s the customer feedback element of Twitter that remains untapped and presents a huge opportunity for organizations to understand the real voices of their customers. But these voices are different from the ones you commonly hear via surveys, which encourage filtered, rationally processed and controlled retrospective responses. Voices on Twitter are raw and emotive because they are expressed while people are actually having that experience. And because they are not directed by specific questions, they often surface feedback you wouldn’t think to ask about. Twitter has always been a great place for organizations to engage with consumers, not only to resolve their issues and enquiries, but also to learn from the wealth of opinions they freely share. So instead of chasing people around the web or bombarding their inbox for feedback, what if you listened to what they were already saying?

It’s where writers, experts and curators – from individual creators to journalists to publishers themselves – go to share their written work, spark meaningful conversations and build a loyal following. These writers and long-form content curators are a valuable part of the conversation and it’s critical we offer new ways for them to create and share their content, and importantly, help them grow and better connect with their audience. To jumpstart our efforts, Twitter has acquired Revue, a service that makes it free and easy for anyone to start and publish editorial newsletters. Revue will accelerate our work to help people stay informed about their interests while giving all types of writers a way to monetize their audience – whether it’s through the one they built at a publication, their website, on Twitter, or elsewhere. Supporting writers across our service With a robust community of writers and readers, Twitter is uniquely positioned to help organizations and writers grow their readership faster and at a much larger scale than anywhere else. Many established writers and publishers have built their brand on Twitter, amassing an audience that’s hungry for the next article or perspective they Tweet. Our goal is to make it easy for them to connect with their subscribers, while also helping readers better discover writers and their content. We’re imagining a lot of ways to do this, from allowing people to sign up for newsletters from their favorite follows on Twitter, to new settings for writers to host conversations with their subscribers. It will all work seamlessly within Twitter. And for those looking to generate revenue, we’re creating a durable incentive model through paid newsletters. Bringing Revue to Twitter will supercharge this offering, helping writers grow their paid subscribers while also incentivizing them to produce engaging and relevant content that drives conversations on Twitter. You can expect audience-based monetization to be an area that we’ll continue to develop new ways to support, whether it’s helping broaden revenue streams or serving as a cornerstone of someone’s business. What’s next for Revue and Twitter Starting today, we’re making Revue’s Pro features free for all accounts and lowering the paid newsletter fee to 5%, a competitive rate that lets writers keep more of the revenue generated from subscriptions. We will continue to invest in Revue as a standalone service, and its team will remain focused on improving the ways writers create their newsletters, build their audience and get paid for their work. We’re also expanding their team and hiring for key roles across engineering, design, research and data science. Over time, this team will build more discovery, reading, and conversational experiences centered around long-form content on Twitter. This is just the first step for us as we continue to enhance the public conversation on Twitter, and we welcome all creators – from experts and curators to journalists and publishers – to join us on our journey. We can’t wait to share more on our progress soon. Welcome to the team, Revue!"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation","date":"2021-01-24T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights","Product","Social Intelligence","Social Insights","User Experience"],"title":"Introducing Birdwatch, a community-based approach to misinformation","text":"As of November 2022, Birdwatch is now Community Notes. People come to Twitter to stay informed, and they want credible information to help them do so. We apply labels and add context to Tweets, but we don't want to limit efforts to circumstances where something breaks our rules or receives widespread public attention. We also want to broaden the range of voices that are part of tackling this problem, and we believe a community-driven approach can help. That’s why today we’re introducing Birdwatch, a pilot in the US of a new community-driven approach to help address misleading information on Twitter. Here’s how it works Birdwatch allows people to identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable. Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors. In this first phase of the pilot, notes will only be visible on a separate Birdwatch site. On this site, pilot participants can also rate the helpfulness of notes added by other contributors. These notes are being intentionally kept separate from Twitter for now, while we build Birdwatch and gain confidence that it produces context people find helpful and appropriate. Additionally, notes will not have an effect on the way people see Tweets or our system recommendations. Building together To date, we have conducted more than 100 qualitative interviews with individuals across the political spectrum who use Twitter, and we received broad general support for Birdwatch. In particular, people valued notes being in the community’s voice (rather than that of Twitter or a central authority) and appreciated that notes provided useful context to help them better understand and evaluate a Tweet (rather than focusing on labeling content as “true” or “false”). Our goal is to build Birdwatch in the open, and have it shaped by the Twitter community. To that end, we’re also taking significant steps to make Birdwatch transparent: All data contributed to Birdwatch will be publicly available and downloadable in TSV files As we develop algorithms that power Birdwatch — such as reputation and consensus systems — we aim to publish that code publicly in the Birdwatch Guide. The initial ranking system for Birdwatch is already available here. We hope this will enable experts, researchers, and the public to analyze or audit Birdwatch, identifying opportunities or flaws that can help us more quickly build an effective community-driven solution. We want to invite anyone to sign up and participate in this program, and know that the broader and more diverse the group, the better Birdwatch will be at effectively addressing misinformation. More details on how to apply here. What’s next We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors. We’ll be focused on these things throughout the pilot. From embedding a member of the University of Chicago’s Center for RISC on our team to hosting feedback sessions with experts in a variety of disciplines, we’re also reaching beyond our virtual walls and integrating social science and academic perspectives into the development of Birdwatch. We know this might be messy and have problems at times, but we believe this is a model worth trying. We invite you to learn alongside as we continue to explore different ways of addressing a common problem. Follow @Birdwatch for the latest updates and to provide feedback on how we are doing."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/bringing-tips-to-everyone","date":"2021-01-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Bringing Tips to everyone","text":"Editorial note: This blog was first posted on September 23 2021, and last updated February 16, 2022, to reflect additional availability for Tips.

We believe in a fair and forward-looking approach to regulation that protects what’s best about our online environment and promotes the values of innovation, strong competition, and consumer choice that underpin the global, Open Internet. Before addressing the DSA directly, we note our concern regarding the ongoing fragmentation of Internet rule-making across the EU. Instead of recognising that a borderless utility like the Internet benefits from regional and global agreement of standards, countries are moving ahead with national models of regulation. This has the fundamental effect of undermining the foundational principle of the Digital Single Market (DSM), namely that its purpose is to create one set of rules for one market. Each national legislative initiative that overlaps or directly conflicts with the DSA picks at the threads of the DSM, fraying it further and further, making Europe a more challenging business environment for companies of all sizes. This challenge becomes greater for smaller companies that are already facing the formidable task of competing with the very largest players in our industry. We urge the Commission and the EU institutions to state clearly that the DSM must be preserved by coherent and regional rule-making, and that national measures should be discouraged. This issue goes to the heart of whether Europe is committed to creating a digital economy that’s built on the Open Internet. Further, we see a worrying trend whereby the EU or a member state will enact legislation with onerous and highly local requirements, or prescribe severe sanctions. The fairness of enforcement is dependent on due process protections embedded in the legal system around the law. Another country may then copy that law, often outside the EU, but its legal and political system places less emphasis on due process. In this way, more repressive regimes can exert pressure on platforms to comply with requests that would restrict certain businesses, freedom of expression, political dissent, journalism, and activism. The EU and its member states must be careful to build due process protections into legislation that may be exported across borders. As Access Now has said, “the DSA will set a precedent for content governance beyond the European Union. If not done right, the negative impact of this legislation could be far-reaching for human rights protection in the online ecosystem.” Europe’s example here is critical and must be considered in an international context. We urge policymakers across Europe to be mindful of their unique role at this time. The DSA is breaking new ground, largely for the positive, and this process of regional standard-setting should be allowed to play out before further action is taken at member state level. Done right, the introduction of harmonised standards across the EU will avoid stifling competition and innovation, leading to a more diverse online ecosystem, and they’ll set a global benchmark for others to follow. Put simply, the DSA must defend the ideal of the Digital Single Market as Europe’s commitment to the Open Internet. LEGISLATING FOR THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET We welcome the maintenance of a prohibition on general monitoring and the legislative focus on illegal content. We encourage policymakers to further clarify what content is considered illegal across the EU. However, we believe that focusing excessively on increasingly outmoded models of content moderation stifles competition and undermines freedom of expression. The DSA should encourage judicious and deliberate decision-making on content, rather than impose overreaching notice and takedown requirements that would incentivise risk-averse removal of content. European Digital Rights (EDRi) has noted that “in a world in which people upload millions of hours of video and billions of photos and texts every day, it has become impossible to determine the legality of every single piece with certainty… Most of those instances require an informed legality assessment by a trained professional in order to avoid a large number of wrongful removals.” We ask the EU to adopt the principle that actual knowledge of illegality is only obtained by intermediaries if it comes through a legally defined judicial process. We further believe that a more nuanced approach would be in the best interests of the regulator, companies of all sizes, and the user. As we’ve said before, content policy can shape the competitive marketplace, and as such, overly rigid and intensive proposals (such as those set out in Articles 14 to 21) risk setting regulatory barriers that only a handful of companies have the resources to meet. Stanford’s Daphne Keller says these provisions, as a whole, require that platforms of all sizes and varieties be “deeply regulated, and regulable, or stop existing.” It seems intuitive that the outcome of the system currently proposed will be to the benefit of the largest companies in our industry. Indeed, Keller goes on to say that “the DSA effectively forfeits competition and consumer choice as a way of shaping platform behavior, in favor of having a few heavily regulated entities.” Therefore, we encourage regulators to include additional flexibility for deliberation, while placing more focus on business structure and incentives. The DSA should enshrine the principle that content moderation should be proportionate to the perceived harm. This will move us towards a more balanced approach to moderation, moving past the leave-up-take-down models of the past. In the long term, the question of how users encounter content may be more important than whether content exists, particularly as swathes of the Internet shift to a more decentralised existence. Further, an assessment of how platforms offer users meaningful choice and control in their online experience will go to the heart of societal concerns regarding the Internet’s effect on democracies and the health of our information environment. By placing emphasis on these areas, regulators will have taken more holistic measures to counter potential online harms. Such policies will also stand the test of time, enduring beyond technological cycles. REAL CHOICE AND FAIR COMPETITION The Open Internet thrives because of its architecture, with consumer choice and open standards between platforms. Open architectures, done properly, do not lock-in dominant business or service models. As several members of the European Parliament recently pointed out, interoperability protects users and competition. We welcome the European Commission’s proposals in this area but also encourage decision-makers to include more robust provisions fostering interoperability in Chapter 3 of the DSA. The Internet is more than a handful of companies. We call on policymakers to recognise this by including more precision in the criteria for very large online platforms (VLOPS) in Chapter 3, Section 4. Although a certain degree of latitude is needed to guarantee the flexibility of legislation, this should not be done at the expense of the online ecosystem by requiring smaller actors to meet requirements that only the largest, wealthiest, and market-dominant companies can shoulder. There is the perception of Internet companies and there is the reality – sometimes the latter starkly differs from the former and the criteria for VLOPs should be grounded in practical reality. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY There is a need to strike the right balance between technical transparency and things that actually empower consumers with more choice and control. We support simple yet meaningful ways for users to exercise privacy and data choices, for example through greater control of ad targeting, while also requiring companies to set out their Terms of Service in simple, understandable terms. We commit to continue increasing transparency around policy enforcement and data access to empower research and more disclosures around coordinated efforts to manipulate platforms. It is crucial that transparency requirements outlined in Articles 13 and 23 of the DSA should not undermine these efforts to protect users, or inadvertently expose services to potential harm, for example, exposing enforcement methods or techniques that could be leveraged to undermine those efforts. Our services are part of a larger information ecosystem that includes companies of all sizes, nonprofit organisations, publishers, academic institutions, and more. To ensure meaningful transparency, it is necessary that we have flexible and differentiated requirements across all sectors. These requirements should recognise how each entity approaches transparency in ways that reflect their operations. Horizontal requirements will only create an apples to oranges comparison between organisations large and small, centralised and decentralised.

The networks we are disclosing relate to independent, state-affiliated information operations that we have attributed to Armenia, Russia and a previously disclosed network from Iran. Once our investigations were complete, the 373 associated accounts across the four networks were permanently suspended from Twitter for violations of our platform manipulation policies. As with previous disclosures, we shared early access to the data we’re releasing today with the Stanford Internet Observatory for independent investigation and analysis. Iran As we proactively communicated in October 2020, and based on information provided to us by the FBI, we removed approximately 130 accounts originating in Iran that were attempting to disrupt the public conversation during the first 2020 US Presidential Debate. After the final investigation was complete, we have suspended a total of 238 accounts operating from Iran for various violations of our platform manipulation policies. As previously stated, the accounts had low engagement and did not make an impact on the public conversation. Today, we’re adding these accounts to the archive to empower independent research and analysis. Armenia Under our platform manipulation policy, we investigated and removed 35 accounts that had ties to the Government of Armenia. These accounts were created in order to advance narratives that were targeting Azerbaijan and were geostrategically favorable to the Armenian government. In some cases, the fake accounts purported to represent government and political figures in Azerbaijan, as well as news entities claiming to operate in Azerbaijan. The accounts engaged in spammy activity to gain followers and further amplify this narrative. Russia Today we’re disclosing two separate networks that have Russian ties. 1. Our first investigation found and removed a network of 69 fake accounts that can be reliably tied to Russian state actors. A number of these accounts amplified narratives that were aligned with the Russian government, while another subset of the network focused on undermining faith in the NATO alliance and its stability. 2. As part of our second investigation in this region, we removed 31 accounts from two networks that show signs of being affiliated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and Russian government-linked actors. These accounts amplified narratives that had been previously associated with the IRA and other Russian influence efforts targeting the United States and European Union. With every disclosure we make, we want to continue to educate people on the tactics used by state actors in order to manipulate or undermine the open democratic conversation that happens on Twitter. Since we launched our first archive in October 2018, we have disclosed data related to more than 85,000 accounts associated with platform manipulation campaigns originating from 20 countries, to our information operations archive. We believe we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the public conversation and to offer transparency on our findings. Our partnerships in this area are key to the work we undertake and we will continue to keep our archive updated so the public, journalists, and the research community can access and analyze these networks.

Earlier this year we announced our plans to better support shopping on Twitter, and today we’re excited to announce the next step in that journey: Live Shopping. Live Shopping on Twitter While watching a Live Shopping stream on Twitter, people can take several actions that make the shopping experience on Twitter seamless, such as: Check out the Shoppable Banner and Shop Tab on the Live event’s page. Toggle back and forth between the Latest Tab and the Shop Tab throughout the livestream, allowing them to be a part of the conversation as they check out products. Continue to watch the livestream on the merchant’s website within an in-app browser, so they don’t miss a thing while making a purchase. We are conducting our first test of Live Shopping in collaboration with Walmart, where they will be kicking off Cyber Week with singer, songwriter, dancer and social media superstar Jason Derulo for the first-ever shoppable livestream on Twitter. Starting at 7pm ET on Sunday, November 28, people can watch and shop from @Walmart (on iOS and desktop), where Jason will host a 30-minute variety show highlighting electronics, home goods, apparel, seasonal décor, surprise special guests and much more. “Twitter continues to be an important platform for Walmart’s business and our customers. We’ve been focused on charting new territory in shoppable livestreams and are excited to celebrate an important milestone together with the first Livestream Shopping event on Twitter. We’re meeting customers where they are and making it easier to shop incredible deals and find inspiration through dynamic, interactive experiences. We look forward to continuing to bring engaging experiences to our customers that allow them to shop seamlessly while also being entertained.” William White Chief Marketing Officer at Walmart People naturally come to Twitter during major cultural events. Livestreaming on Twitter gives businesses the power to engage with their most influential fans, and adding the ability to shop into this experience is a natural extension to attracting and engaging with receptive audiences. What’s Next for Twitter Shopping? Expanding our Shop Spotlight Test Earlier this year, we began testing the Shop Spotlight with select brands, and we are pleased to share that we will be launching it to more merchants in the United States in the coming weeks. Introducing Twitter Shopping Manager It is crucial to build foundational products to support our global community of merchants on Twitter, so we will also start testing a new way to house merchant onboarding and product catalog management tools via the Twitter Shopping Manager. This will give merchants a one-stop-shop for managing how they show up on Twitter.

Before the #SquidGame phenomenon, we saw other K-content including movies, drama series, and webtoons (comics, manhwa) talked about a lot on Twitter on a global scale. Speaking at the 2021 Seoul International Music Fair(MU:CON 2021), Twitter introduced big data insights with the theme of ‘#BeyondKpop: Globalization of K-Culture from Music to Drama, Webtoon, Movie and beyond’, and Top 20 most Tweeted K-content. Twitter has been at the center of global conversations about K-pop music scenes, and this new announcement reflects our effect on the global spread of various K-content like Korean popular dramas, webtoons, and movies as well as K-pop music. You can watch the full presentation at ‘#BeyondKpop : Globalization of K-Culture from Music to Drama, Webtoon, Movie and beyond'. Here is my summary of the announcement at MU:CON 2021. The results of data aggregation were conducted by Twitter and VAIV company through big data text mining techniques that analyzed global English Tweets from July 2018 to June 2021. Most-mentioned K-dramas show a clear connection to K-pop Top 20 Most-Mentioned K-Dramas on Twitter in the World (July 2018 ~ June 2021) Kingdom (2019, Netflix original) Itaewon Class (2020, JTBC) True Beauty (2020, tvN) Vincenzo (2021, tvN) Sky Castle (2018, JTBC) Hotel Del Luna (2019, tvN) Start-Up (2020, tvN) Hospital Playlist (2020, tvN) Goblin (2016, tvN) The Penthouse (2020, SBS) Vagabond (2019, SBS) Sweet Home (2020, Netflix original) Crash Landing on You (2019, tvN) Voice (2017, OCN) Love Alarm (2019, Netflix original) It’s Okay to Not Be Okay (2020, tvN) Kairos (2020, MBC) Arthdal Chronicles (2019, tvN) Extracurricular (2020, Netflix original) Forest of Secrets/Stranger (2017, tvN) For many K-pop fans, K-dramas were the next type of K-content they tried after falling in love with K-pop, and the most popular K-dramas reflect this preference. The top four most-mentioned K-dramas around the world were ranked as follows: Kingdom at number one, Itaewon Class (based on the original webtoon) at number two, True Beauty at number three, and Vincenzo at number four. True Beauty and Vincenzo both include roles for K-pop stars, with Cha Eun-woo (a member of the male K-pop group ASTRO) appearing in True Beauty, and Ok Taec-yeon (a member of the male K-pop group 2PM) starring in Vincenzo. Twitter’s analysis of the word cloud for Tweets mentioning Itaewon Class confirmed that many Tweets about Itaewon Class mentioned the OST song “Sweet Night” by V, a member of the male K-pop group BTS. The word cloud also connected Itaewon Class to 11 other dramas during the first half of 2021. This shows that interest in Itaewon Class led fans to other K-dramas, making Itaewon Class a critical influence for K-content and new fans getting more interested. Most-mentioned webtoons boosted interest in webtoons with related K-dramas Top 20 Most-Mentioned K-Webtoons on Twitter in the World (July 2018 ~ June 2021) True Beauty (2018, Naver Webtoon) Sweet Home (2017, Naver Webtoon) Tower of God (2010, Naver Webtoon) Itaewon Class (2017, Kakao Webtoon) Noblesse (2007, Naver Webtoon) Navillera (2016, Kakao Webtoon) Romance 101 (2018, Naver Webtoon) Omniscient reader (2020, Naver Webtoon) Eleceed (2018, Naver Webtoon) Dice (2013, Naver Webtoon) Along with the gods (2010, Naver Webtoon) Weak hero (2018, Naver Webtoon) I Love Yoo (2017, Naver Webtoon) Wind breaker (2013, Naver Webtoon) Annarasumanara (2010, Naver Webtoon) Unholy blood (2020, Naver Webtoon) Sole leveling (2016, Naver Webtoon) Random chat (2017, Naver Webtoon) Kubera (2010, Naver Webtoon) Gosu (2015, Naver Webtoon) With K-pop music reaching all-time highs, and the popularity of K-dramas surging accordingly, original K-webtoons are also seeing increased interest, especially for webtoons that have been turned into K-dramas. Many of the most-mentioned webtoons have been turned into K-dramas. True Beauty, which ranked third in the most-mentioned K-dramas on Twitter, ranked first in the most-mentioned K-webtoons on Twitter. Sweet Home, which was turned into a Netflix original series, ranked second in the most mentioned K-webtoons. Itaewon Class, which ranked fourth, was later turned into a K-drama, while Navillera (sixth) not only was later turned into a K-drama, but also benefited from BTS member V recommending the drama on a fan cafe. Most-mentioned movies show the impact of Korea’s biggest directors Top 20 Most-Mentioned K-Movies on Twitter in the World (July 2018 ~ June 2021) Parasite (2019) Minari (2020) Snowpiercer (2013) Oldboy (2003) Space sweepers (2020) Swing kids (2018) Okja (2017) Train to Busan: Peninsula (2020) Train to Busan (2016) Mother (2009) The Call (2020) Along with the gods (2017) Exit (2019) Forgotten (2017) Voice of silence (2020) Thirst (2009) Samjin Company English Class (2020) Little forest (2018) Burning (2018) The Host (2006) Just three film directors accounted for nine of the top 20 K-movies that are most-mentioned on Twitter. Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho, was the most-mentioned K-movie on Twitter, but Bong’s other movies, Snowpiercer, Okja, Mother, and The Host, all were among the top 20. Directors Park Chan-wook and Yeon Sang-ho also accounted for two K-movies apiece, with Oldboy and Thirst, and Peninsula and Train to Busan, respectively. Twitter’s analysis of Tweets related to Bong Joon-ho showed keywords related to Parasite (which won four Academy Awards in 2020), Mother, and Snowpiercer respectively, as well as works by other prominent directors Park Chan-wook and Lee Chang-dong. Twitter’s analysis shows that interest in Bong Joon-ho helped to drive interest in K-movies broadly. The conversation around K-content will continue to expand Twitter has proven that K-pop - along with many other fandoms - thrive due to the characteristics of Twitter: live, public, and conversational. People are consuming K-content through various channels, but in the end, the conversations are being held on Twitter. As Squid Game is trending worldwide, there are already many fans of the show on Twitter, and new movies, dramas, and webtoons are ready to meet global fans in the second half of this year. We will continue to do our best to help you enjoy content around the world on Twitter.

This effort is part of our ongoing work to look at algorithms across a range of topics. We recently shared the findings of our analysis of bias in our image cropping algorithm and how they informed changes in our product. Today, we’re publishing learnings from another study: an in-depth analysis of whether our recommendation algorithms amplify political content. The first part of the study examines Tweets from elected officials* in seven countries (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Since Tweets from elected officials cover just a small portion of political content on the platform, we also studied whether our recommendation algorithms amplify political content from news outlets. Since 2016, people on Twitter have been able to choose between viewing algorithmically ordered Tweets first in the Home timeline or viewing the most recent Tweets in reverse chronological order. An algorithmic Home timeline displays a stream of Tweets from accounts you have chosen to follow on Twitter, as well as recommendations of other content we think you might be interested in based on accounts you interact with frequently, Tweets you engage with, and more. As a result, what an individual sees on their Home timeline is a function of how they interact with the algorithmic system, as well as how the system is designed. The purpose of this study was to better understand the amplification of elected officials’ political content on our algorithmically ranked Home timeline versus the reverse chronological Home timeline. We hope our findings will contribute to an evidence-based discussion of the role these algorithms play in shaping political content consumption on the internet. In our study, we examined algorithmic amplification of political content in the Home timeline by asking the following questions: How much algorithmic amplification does political content from elected officials receive in Twitter’s algorithmically ranked Home timeline versus in the reverse chronological timeline? Does this amplification vary across political parties or within a political party? Are some types of political groups algorithmically amplified more than others? Are these trends consistent across countries? Are some news outlets amplified more by algorithms than others? Does news media algorithmic amplification favor one side of the political spectrum more than the other? How we conducted the study We analyzed millions of Tweets from April 1 to August 15, 2020, from accounts operated by elected officials in seven countries. We used this data to test whether or not these Tweets are amplified more on the algorithmically ranked Home timeline than the reverse chronological feed and whether there was variance within a party. We used public, third-party sources (such as official institutional websites) to identify political party affiliation. We did not use Tweet content to attempt to infer political views of elected officials. To study algorithmic amplification of news outlets, we analyzed hundreds of millions of Tweets containing links to articles shared by people on Twitter during the same time period. The outlets were categorized based on media bias ratings from two independent organizations, AllSides and Ad Fontes Media. We excluded Tweets pointing to non-political content such as recipes or sports. What did we find? Tweets about political content from elected officials, regardless of party or whether the party is in power, do see algorithmic amplification when compared to political content on the reverse chronological timeline. Group effects did not translate to individual effects. In other words, since party affiliation or ideology is not a factor our systems consider when recommending content, two individuals in the same political party would not necessarily see the same amplification. In six out of seven countries — all but Germany — Tweets posted by accounts from the political right receive more algorithmic amplification than the political left when studied as a group. Right-leaning news outlets, as defined by the independent organizations listed above, see greater algorithmic amplification on Twitter compared to left-leaning news outlets. However, as highlighted in the paper, these third-party ratings make their own, independent classifications and as such the results of analysis may vary depending on which source is used. You can read the entirety of our findings in the paper here. What’s next? In this study, we identify what is happening: certain political content is amplified on the platform. Establishing why these observed patterns occur is a significantly more difficult question to answer as it is a product of the interactions between people and the platform. The ML Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team’s mission, as researchers and practitioners embedded within a social media company, is to identify both, and mitigate any inequity that may occur. This research study highlights the complex interplay between an algorithmic system and people using the platform. Algorithmic amplification is not problematic by default – all algorithms amplify. Algorithmic amplification is problematic if there is preferential treatment as a function of how the algorithm is constructed versus the interactions people have with it. Further root cause analysis is required in order to determine what, if any, changes are required to reduce adverse impacts by our Home timeline algorithm. How can these findings be validated? It’s important for us to share the data we used to conduct this study so other researchers can reproduce our work. To aid this, we are making aggregated datasets available for third party researchers who wish to reproduce our main findings and validate our methodology, upon request. Details on what is included in this data are given in the paper. For full transparency, researchers would ideally have access to the raw data from which these aggregates were calculated, but this is extremely difficult without compromising privacy. For the past several months, META has been looking into methods to responsibly make available large datasets to support validation. We’re finalizing a partnership to leverage privacy preserving technology to enable third-party researchers to reproduce this type of work, while also protecting and safeguarding the privacy of people who use Twitter. This approach is new and hasn’t been used at this scale, but we are optimistic that it will address the privacy-vs-accountability tradeoffs that can hinder algorithmic transparency. We’re excited about the opportunities this work may unlock for future collaboration with external researchers looking to reproduce, validate and extend our internal research. We’ll share more about this partnership soon. We hope that by sharing this analysis today, we can help spark a productive conversation with the broader research community to examine various hypotheses for why we are generally observing comparatively more right-leaning political amplification of elected officials’ content on Twitter.

As part of that mission, in December 2020, we shared our commitment to undergo the Media Ratings Council’s accreditation process across all four of their Accreditation Service focus areas: Viewability, Sophisticated Invalid Traffic Filtration, Audience Measurement, and Brand Safety. In that announcement, we shared that we would begin this process with the Brand Safety audit. Our team has spent the first half of 2021 working with the MRC to align on the scope, sequencing, and timing of the audits. We are pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with the MRC for a Brand Safety pre-assessment and we are excited to begin reaching additional milestones as we move into the second half of this year. Twitter and the MRC have agreed that the Brand Safety audit will assess our compliance with certain Brand Safety standards when serving ads in environments including Home timeline, User profiles, Search results, and our Amplify pre-roll product. In the coming months, we will undergo a pre-assessment process which is designed to help both Twitter and the MRC assess the audit-readiness of Twitter’s operations, methodology, processing, reporting, and disclosures in the Brand Safety space. We will use the findings of this pre-assessment to identify any areas of improvement and agree on high-level recommendations for remediating any gaps. Given the established scope of the MRC Brand Safety audit, Twitter is also committed to continuing to work with the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) to align on industry standards and to help shape how the advertising industry as a whole thinks about brand safety, brand suitability, and other safety and integrity issues. Simultaneously, we are continuing to work towards the next big milestones which include agreements with the MRC about the scope of and timelines for the Audience Measurement, Viewability, and Sophisticated Invalid Traffic Filtration audits. We expect to tackle the Audience Measurement audit next, with the remaining two to follow in sequence.

That’s why we regularly collaborate with trusted partners on our Trust and Safety Council to develop products and programs, and to improve the Twitter Rules. Today, we’re sharing a recap of some of the work we’ve accomplished hand-in-hand with these trusted partners, as well as more about our ongoing commitment to incorporating the expertise of global experts, researchers, and developers to support healthy public conversation on Twitter. Incorporating feedback to make Twitter safer We know the best version of Twitter is the one built by the people who use it. Over the past year, we’ve engaged with the Trust and Safety Council on thirteen projects early in the development process. We distilled and put to use their feedback on ways we can offer a better and safer experience for people using Twitter. Their feedback directly informed our approach on several products. Communities: We incorporated feedback on the need to manage expectations on the role that moderators play by limiting the number of responsibilities and building tools to help them manage potential harassment. Tips: We incorporated feedback on the need to emphasize that the people on our service are responsible for transactions in a user-friendly way by asking people to agree to terms of service when enabling the feature. Safety Mode: To mitigate the effect on limiting counter-speech, a concern raised by the council particularly for people in positions of power, we decided to automatically time out interventions for seven days. Conversation settings: We started testing a notification that reminds people they can change who can reply to their Tweets to increase awareness and adoption as a direct recommendation from the council. Twitter has become an extremely important communication tool in India, and it is encouraging to see Twitter take active interest and respond to the feedback given by council members. We’re happy to be part of a team of trusted partners which gets heard and is able to make Twitter a safer platform for all, especially women. Centre for Social Research As a founding member of the Trust and Safety Council, we’ve worked alongside Twitter to help influence positive change for over a decade. We believe that everyone should benefit from technology free from abuse and harassment and bring this perspective to all council meetings. We look forward to continued collaboration with Twitter to ensure that matters raised by our organization and the people we support are integrated into Twitter’s products and policies. SWGfL UK Safer Internet Centre partner Transparency is core to Twitter’s approach. Through initiatives such as our open developer platform, our information operations archive, and our disclosures in the Twitter Transparency Center and Lumen, we continue to support third-party research of what’s happening on Twitter. We’ll continue to build on these efforts and inform the public as we improve Twitter in the open. The following are highlights from the past year. Twitter API for Academic Research: In early 2021, we launched a dedicated Academic Research product track on the new Twitter API giving qualified researchers access to the entire history of public conversation and elevated access to real-time data for free. Algorithmic bias bounty challenge: When we introduced our commitment to responsible machine learning, we also said, “the journey to responsible, responsive, and community-driven machine learning systems is a collaborative one.” That’s why we introduced the industry’s first algorithmic bias bounty competition to draw on the global ethical AI community’s knowledge of the unintended harms of saliency algorithms to expand our own understanding and to reward the people doing work in this field. Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC): We announced the creation of a new global expert group of academics, members of civil societies and NGOs, and journalists to study platform governance issues. We look forward to deeper analysis from this range of global experts and expect the collaboration to result in expanded disclosures beyond information operations to include sharing data in areas like misinformation, coordinated harmful activity, and safety. Launch of an API curriculum: “Getting started with the Twitter API for Academic Research” is now being used at universities, enabling students and teachers to learn how to use Twitter data for academic research. It is currently starred by over 200 academics on Github. Creation of a Developer Platform Academic Research advisory board: This group of 12 scholars began work with our team this year to better understand how we can enhance the use of the Twitter API for academic research, while increasing meaningful dialogue between the Twitter Academic program and the academic community. Developer research highlights: We published and continued to spotlight key research areas Twitter teams are working on today in an effort to inspire even more researchers to pursue these topics. What’s next? Increasing transparency and understanding on our approach to content moderation As we continue to invite trusted partners and the public to share feedback on ways to make Twitter safe, it’s important to be transparent about how we develop and enforce the Twitter Rules. Our newly formed Content Governance Initiative (CGI) aims to do this by developing a governance framework that provides a consistent and principled approach to the development, enforcement, and assessment of our global rules and policies. To build our governance framework, we’re engaging external stakeholders and have created an additional advisory group on our Trust and Safety Council. We’ll continue collaborating with this group and cross-functional teams across Twitter to establish standardized guidelines on policy development, enforcement, and appeals that help drive a common understanding of Twitter’s approach to content moderation. The framework's principles and guidelines will aim to fulfill the following objectives: Build legitimacy and trust through transparency and accountability. Deepen our commitment to good governance and human rights. Provide additional clarity on Twitter’s content moderation processes. Affirm our commitment to serving a diverse and inclusive global community. We recognize that achieving these objectives will not be easy. Content moderation at scale is a highly complex and challenging process. This initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to working systematically — in partnership with external stakeholders around the world — to improve the transparency and consistency of our content moderation processes. Here’s to another year of building together We want to acknowledge the members of the Trust and Safety Council, research partners, civil society representatives, and you, the people using Twitter, for continuing to hold us accountable. You challenge us, offer different perspectives, and support us in our mission to safeguard the public conversation.

Though we aim to enforce our rules as equitably and even-handedly as possible, our first priority is the safety of the people on Twitter and those on the ground. We operate in favor of action. We look at specific indicators of offline harm to guide our product interventions, and, in a crisis situation, are willing to risk potential false positives and reverse our decisions, if appealed. Specifically, we’ve: Paused Trends in Ethiopia, given the potential for harm and attempts to manipulate trending topics. Paused List discovery, to limit the targeting and harassment of individuals. Launched a search prompt with relevant keywords that points to a Twitter Moment with digital safety and security resources. Halted advertisements in the region. We also continue to: Monitor the service for signs of platform manipulation and spam based on behavior and building new detections and mitigations for “copypasta” and other types of platform manipulation that we’ve observed in the context of the crisis. Deamplify harmful content, including claims that create risk of harm to humanitarian workers on the ground. Our action is informed by conversations with a wide range of trusted partners including local and international civil society organizations and experts to ensure diverse perspectives and understand what they’re seeing. We believe Twitter is a place for different voices and perspectives to be heard. Our rules are enforced objectively on content and accounts — we remain neutral to political identity and ideology. And, when possible, we strive to ensure our actions are proportionate to the propensity for harm. We are constantly updating our approach and reviewing remediations holistically before deciding on a course of action, while doing everything we can to reduce harm."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/allyship-right-now-stand-for-asians","date":"2021-01-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Diversity","#UntilWeAllBelong","Company"],"title":"Allyship right now: #StandForAsians","text":"As anti-Asian racism and xenophobia continue to grow, we’ve seen an increase in attacks against Asian communities and individuals around the world. It’s important to know that this isn’t new; throughout history, Asians have experienced violence and exclusion. However, their diverse lived experiences have largely been overlooked. We also cannot forget historical efforts to create rifts — often perpetuated by the model minority myth — between Asian and Black communities. The time for allyship is long overdue. The time for allyship is now. At Twitter, our principles of allyship are straightforward: Learn Ask Show up Speak up Here’s how you can practice allyship right now: Learn Do your research to understand what Asian communities have faced and are facing right now — at home, and around the world. Here’s just a few resources to check out: Twitter thread about recent and historical anti-Asian violence News coverage on The Cut about rising anti-Asian hate crimes in the US A Washington Post article on the history of anti-Asian xenophobia Michelle Kim’s Medium blog post detailing historical context of the Model Minority Myth to today A short from AJ+ video on Why We Call Asian Americans the Model Minority Ask Check in on your folks. Approach questions with empathy and curiosity as a way to understand people’s lived experiences. Do not approach asking questions from a place of disbelief. Especially as a leader or a manager, it’s important to create the space for people on your team who may be experiencing fear, anger, or anxiety. Questions you can ask: Do you feel comfortable sharing your experience with me? How are you feeling/coping? How can I help? When someone’s sharing their experience with you, it’s enough to simply say, “I hear you.” Don’t feel like you need to respond, or provide your own story. Instead, center them, and listen to what they’re sharing with you. Show up In a time when we’re all social distancing, it may seem difficult to show up physically for your colleagues or community members. Try doing it virtually. Engage with Tweets amplifying Asian voices and experiences, attend virtual events, sign petitions, find and reach out to local Asian community centers, and ask how you can support. Here are some accounts you can follow: Esther Choo: @choo_ek Jenny Yang: @jennyyangtv HuffPost Asian Voices: @HPAsianVoices William Yu: @its_willyu Karen Han: @karenyhan Alice Wong: @SFdirewolf Amanda Nguyen: @nguyen_amanda Michelle Kim: @mjmichellekim Act to Change: @ActToChange Dion Lim: @DionLimTV Stop AAPI Hate: @StopAAPIHate Consider shopping from an Asian-owned businesses. Place orders for food, goods, or even gift cards. Now is the time to show your support for local Asian businesses that have been struggling since the start of the pandemic. Donate! If you can, support organizations that are supporting Asian communities. Using a restorative justice and community based approach, Stop AAPI Hate launched in March of last year to track and respond to incidents of hate, violence, harassment, and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The Asian American Journalist Association (AAJA) works towards the visibility and inclusion of AAPI journalists in newsroom leadership, and towards equitable and accurate coverage of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) and AAPI issues. The Chinatown CDC is a community development organization that serves as neighborhood advocates, organizers and planners, and as developers and managers of affordable housing. And Asian Americans Advancing Justice is an organization dedicated to fighting for civil rights and empowering Asian Americans to create a more just America for all. Speak up In meetings, on Twitter, in conference calls, in chats with friends and family, speak up. Be mindful of misinformation and jokes that are actually offensive and racist. Call out or call in to address harmful behavior. Leverage your voice and privilege to amplify the experiences of Asian communities. Instances of xenophobia aren’t isolated incidents — they’re happening everywhere. Here’re some examples of how you can use your voice: Allyship is not about who you are, but about what you do — daily, and in times of need. Everyone is dealing with a lot these days, but be especially mindful of those who are facing unsafety, violence, and hate because of their identity. There is no better time to stand up for what’s right. Be an ally today, as you may need one tomorrow.

Despite progress with vaccines in some countries, the pandemic still rages in others, exacerbating inequality. We have seen a surge in antisemitism, Arab hate and Islamophobia following violence in Israel and Palestine. We were rocked by revelations of unmarked grave sites of indigenous communities in Canada, and we continue to grapple with racial justice and abuse, most recently spotlighted in the aftermath of the Euros, and protecting the right to vote in the US. These challenges remind us of the importance and urgency of our work. At Twitter, that’s how we’ve approached 2021, and I’m pleased to share that we've made good strides––especially in Tweepforce representation. In fact, the first half of 2021 saw significant gains for representation of global women and US Tweeps from under-represented communities. Check out the latest numbers here. We’re determined to keep up the momentum. We’re also mindful that diversity without inclusion doesn’t work. What’s the point of investing deeply in hiring great talent from underrepresented backgrounds if you don’t create an environment that constantly empowers them to share and leverage their unique perspectives and insights at your company? Our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) - central to driving inclusion across the company We receive a lot of questions about the work we’ve done with our BRGs over the past few years, so I’m sharing an overview here. We kicked off a company-wide listening tour with the leaders of our BRGs in 2018 and learned a lot from them. The most common theme was around resourcing and support: Tweeps were struggling to balance their full time role with their vast BRG responsibilities, their managers didn’t have visibility into their BRG work or the tools to empower them, and there was confusion about where to go in the business for resources or support. We also heard a lot about the desire to be more globally inclusive and intersectional in the work–– but they already had too much on their plate. Here’s how we responded: Expanding BRG leadership: In 2019, we expanded the leadership team of each BRG from two co-chairs to a global team of five co-chairs, adding an events chair, a marketing/comms chair, and a recruitment chair. The new guidelines initially required that at least half of the team be based outside of San Francisco and at least a quarter outside of the U.S. We’ve since replaced the recruitment chair with a social chair, and are moving towards a goal of at least half of each BRG leadership team being based outside of the U.S. Defining roles and responsibilities: Next we introduced job descriptions for each of the global chairs––and for their executive sponsors. For the BRG leaders, we provided guidelines for approximately how much time they should spend on BRG activities throughout the year, and tips for how to represent the work to their managers during 1:1s and in performance evaluations. For BRG executive sponsors, we provided recommendations for the cadence of regular meetings with the leadership teams, how best to engage in BRG events throughout the year, and ways to amplify BRGs in their roles as executive sponsors. Dedicated resources: We also introduced a strategic planning process for the BRGs to align on OKRs and prioritize intersectional programming, a centralized dedicated budget within I&D, a full-time BRG program manager, and dedicated support across the business to assist with company-wide BRG activations within or beyond our walls. Supporting managers: In 2020, we interviewed the 60+ Tweeps who manage our BRG leaders 1:1 to understand the challenges they face. Based on what we heard, we designed and launched a Manager Toolkit to provide more visibility into the work of the BRG leaders they manage, guidance for how they can engage and support their Tweeps throughout the year, and how to acknowledge their leadership as part of annual performance reviews. Later, we launched the #GoodForTwitter initiative so that all Tweeps had the opportunity to list their involvement with BRGs as one of their annual performance goals and have it be part of annual performance reviews. Documenting our process: We often get the question: “can I start a BRG for ______ ?” We launched an internal New BRG Checklist with our criteria which involves the following questions: 1) What identity-based community would this BRG serve and is it currently represented by one of our already existing BRGs? 2) Is this community underrepresented at Twitter and/or in the world? 3) Is this a global community (e.g. is it relevant to Tweeps around the globe and not limited to a specific region)? 4) Has this community faced marginalization, oppression, discrimination or other barriers historically or presently that require dedicated support and resources from the Inclusion & Diversity team? 5) Will having a BRG for this community benefit Twitter’s I&D efforts? Formal compensation: Also in 2020, we introduced a formal compensation program for our BRG global leadership team. The work they are responsible for driving is central to our journey to becoming the world’s most diverse, inclusive, and accessible tech company. It is not a “side-hustle” or volunteer activity. To ensure fairness, we introduced term limits, a transparent election process, and FAQs for BRG members to ensure everyone knows what’s involved. Launching new BRGs: Earlier this year we launched @TwitterArabs and #TwitterIndigenous with the goal of connecting and uplifting more under-represented communities around the world. Moving forward, we have work to do to ensure our BRGs are just as impactful in countries outside of the US by investing more in leadership infrastructure and resources for regional programming. We also know there’s work to do beyond BRGs. As we continue to build momentum in our diversity hiring, we are redoubling efforts across the business on inclusion. Cultivating an inclusive culture Core to belonging is ensuring that Tweeps who are most impacted by traumatizing world events get the support they need from us, while also ensuring allies can learn about the complex issues at hand and how to help. As the ground beneath us shifts, we continue to refine our approach. With each step we learn and grow, and appreciate the support of our Tweeps along the journey. We’ve expanded #FlockTalks around the world–– Tweep-only sessions to hold space for those who’d like to come together in community to share how they're feeling during difficult times. We’ve built on our #TakeCare programming to deliver even more culturally-competent and trauma-informed mental health resources to Tweeps. Recently, we brought in an Asian licensed therapist to help Asian Tweeps process the rise in anti-Asian hate and racism, and a Black licensed therapist (@drmarielbuque) to help Blackbirds process the murder of Daunte Wright and the Derek Chauvin trial. Our #AllyshipRightNow series has expanded to provide more tools for practicing allyship and reducing the emotional burden of asking marginalized tweeps for resources, for example, #StandForAsians Our #TwitterTogetherTalks are company-wide conversations fostering open dialogue about racial equity, anti-racism, and social justice here at Twitter. We recently hosted Professor Erika Lee (@prof_erikalee) for a conversation about the history of Anti-Asian hate and discrimination in the US. We launched Mentoring@, a mentorship pilot program that intentionally centers underrepresented and underserved communities. The program also takes the traditionally hierarchical nature of mentorship into consideration, and ensures that mentees feel empowered and supported throughout. So far, we have over 250 mentors and mentees participating. We recognize the challenges distributed teams have in building an inclusive and collaborative culture. We’ve recently updated our onboarding resources to provide managers and teams with more support and guide best practices for fostering team unity and inclusion. We also launched a new initiative for all people managers to drive participation in existing company-wide I&D programs that help build an inclusive mindset. Starting this year, all Tweeps who manage people are required to get their #InclusiveManagerBadge🏅 by: Completing all I&D skills-building courses: “Allyship 101,” “Healthy Conversations,” “Words Matter” (on microaggressions) and the soon to launch “Anti-Racism 101” Maintaining a “Inclusive Manager” minimum score of 67 in our two annual employee engagement surveys Attending at least four BRG events throughout the year. For 2021, we are also developing Twitter’s principles of Inclusive Leadership, which we’ll integrate into our manager onboarding, and launch as a stand-alone e-learning module so anyone, anywhere can take the training, regardless of role, tenure or location. We've also deepened our collaboration with the Employee Relations (ER) team as they are on the front lines of fielding concerns when underrepresented Tweeps feel excluded. For example, our I&D Health Check Up program (a monthly customized report for each member of our leadership team) now includes information about the prevalence of gender and race-related complaints raised to ER. This helps our executive leadership better understand the types of issues that adversely impact Tweeps' experiences, including the extent to which underrepresented Tweeps feel fairly and respectfully treated, as well as the best way to address root causes. We were honored to receive a top score on the Disability Equality Index® (DEI) for 2021 and be recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion”. We also recently joined The Valuable 500, a coalition of companies and leaders committed to putting accessibility front and center. We have work to do and are determined to accelerate progress on our journey to be one of the world's most accessible tech companies. What’s next Despite all this progress, we’ve got a lot of work to do. We’re especially mindful that the changes we’re making to scale across the business don’t always reach regions around the world with the same impact. We’ve recently expanded our International I&D team including @Olivia_McEvoy, our new I&D International Lead who is based in Dublin. We are excited for what the future holds, including in tailoring regionally relevant solutions as well as programs for the hiring, retention and promotion of Tweeps around the world. We also know we don’t have all the answers. We’ve heard from our peers that many companies are piloting new approaches to drive progress on inclusion. Have you seen something in your company that stands out for its impact in cultivating a more inclusive culture? We want to hear from you–– let’s continue the conversation! Find us @TwitterTogether.

In some languages, such as Arabic, words can be feminine or masculine, but we’ve missed a way for people to tell us how they want to be addressed. So today, we're introducing a new language setting that acknowledges and better supports the Arabic feminine form. People who select this setting will be addressed in the feminine form. For example, “Tweet” will be غرّدي (which addresses women) rather than the default Arabic today, which is غرّد (addressing men). Also, “Explore” will be إستكشفي rather than إستكشف. Here’s how to use it: Log in to Twitter.com, go to “Settings and privacy,” then “Accessibility, display, and languages.” Next, select “Languages” and go to “Display language”. Select “Arabic (feminine)” from the “Display language” drop down menu. The display language on Twitter.com will then address you in the feminine form. Together with the update, we’re launching a campaign titled #FeminineArabic أتحدث_بالمؤنث# to share our approach and partner with others to do so. We created an emoji that gets unlocked with the following English and Arabic hashtags: #FeminineArabic and أتحدث_بالمؤنث# . Join the conversation to see how a number of organizations, brands, and personalities are supporting the campaign so far. We’re adding this language support to Twitter.com and working to bring it to Twitter for iOS and Android as well. We’re committed to using inclusive language at Twitter, regardless if it's written down, shown on our site and apps, or embedded in our code.

In my 2020 year in review I spoke about how necessity had yet again proved to be the mother of invention, with pandemic related lockdowns accelerating the use of underutilized data sources, such as social, to understand consumer opinion and sentiment in real time. And as organizations quickly saw the value in these new sources of insight, it was hard to imagine them going back to the slower, more costly data and opinion gathering techniques of the past. This year has proven that to be correct, and with customer experience and customer centricity now all the rage, social data is proving its worth by surfacing the real voice of the customer in real time. Combine this with the push to democratize insight and integrate these customer voices across the organization, and I believe we are now at a tipping point in the use of social intelligence. In my conversations with dozens of brands over the past year, five main themes stood out to me: You’ve probably heard about \"the great resignation\" but in the world of social intelligence, it’s \"the great consolidation\" that’s top of mind. Spurred on by pandemic lockdowns and restrictions, organizations took to digital transformation with gusto, accelerating the digitization of their customer interactions and internal operations by three to four years according to a 2020 McKinsey study. And, for many, a key step in that transformation journey was to address an unwieldy and duplicative social marketing and customer experience (CX) tech stack. I observed countless organizations turning to social suites, who could offer the core capabilities of content publishing, customer care and listening, as well as many secondary features such as advocacy, content management and influencer marketing to name a few. Brands also realized they didn't need a dozen different social listening providers, prompting them to consolidate down to one or opt for a social suite to deliver everything. They also started to ask tougher questions of prospective vendors about the quality of their AI, in some cases manually auditing the vendors' annotations with human ones to compare accuracy. As buyers were busy consolidating their social media tools, vendors from a variety of diverse backgrounds sought to broaden and strengthen their offerings by acquiring social capabilities. These acquisitions took several forms. First, the merger of traditional media monitoring with social media monitoring continued with Cision's acquisition of Brandwatch, Meltwater's purchase of Linkfluence and Access Intelligence's (Pulsar) merger with Isentia. Secondly, a great many acquisitions fell under the CX umbrella. This included the customer feedback and voice of the customer vendors adding social expertise such as Qualtrics's acquisition of Clarabridge and Reputation's purchase of Nuvi. It also included customer care and engagement vendors adding social capabilities to improve their core offering such as Verint's pickup of Conversocial, Hootsuite's acquisitions of Sparkcentral and Heyday, and Khoros’s purchase of Topbox. We also witnessed a huge IPO, with Sprinklr taking their ‘Unified CXM Platform’ public. All of these moves suggest a vendor landscape beginning to coalesce around three main categories: Communications Clouds, CX Clouds and Insights Clouds. Key to the success of them all has been the integration of social data into their solutions and the ability to blend it with other data sources providing a more comprehensive picture. Which brings me to... Some time ago, social listening vendors began to reframe themselves as 'consumer intelligence platforms,' offering clients the ability to combine social data with other digital sources such as surveys and first-party data. This seemed a natural progression as these tools could already analyze unstructured social posts, so why not apply that to other unstructured data sources and provide brands with a more complete view of consumers. When Forrester released their New Wave on AI-Enabled Consumer Intelligence Platforms in July, it seemed that the era of social listening as a category was coming to an end. And to hammer home the point, just a few months later Zendesk announced its acquisition of Momentive (formerly SurveyMonkey) with the goal of creating a \"powerful new customer intelligence company.\" This combination of CX or behavioral data with solicited and unsolicited feedback seems to be the future of the consumer insights world and would suggest more 'Insights Clouds' are on the horizon. While social listening as a category continues to fade, social intelligence is just getting started. A LinkedIn search finds 15,000 people globally mentioning social intelligence in their profile while another 22,000 mention social media data. And, this phenomenon is not exclusive to those working in agency land or for technology suppliers, but within brands themselves who have been actively recruiting to bring talent in-house. The challenge is in finding people with the right skills and experience to fill these vacancies. I’ve heard many times that this dearth of talent is one reason why specialist research agencies have never been busier. Jeremy Hollow, Founder & MD of Listen + Learn Research, a social data insights agency, commented, \"The market seems to be expanding and maturing, with more of the routine analytical work being brought in-house while agencies are being used to bring deeper strategic insights.” Market research, specifically research tech, is in the midst of an investment frenzy with numerous SaaS upstarts raising funds to disrupt various parts of the research supply chain. In my view, a great many are simply automating manual processes (survey creation, sample access, etc.) while a few are fundamentally challenging the question-based approach to primary research and how we understand consumer needs. They are looking instead to the billions of online conversations on every imaginable subject to collect organic consumer opinions and predict future trends. This data science led approach is allowing insight professionals the ability to analyze huge amounts of unstructured social commentary, providing qualitative insights on a quantitative scale. And it seems that this is a key priority of research buyers as well. A recent GreenBook Report found that the analysis of social media data was their number one area of focus when it came to the adoption of automation. These themes suggest that social intelligence has truly come into its own over the past year with numerous trends conspiring to drive awareness and adoption. Despite that, many organizations still consider social data a marketing-specific resource and undervalue its business impact. Sprout Social’s recent Index survey highlighted this very point, reporting that 46% of respondents saw social data strictly as a marketing resource. Clearly, there’s still work to be done and people to win over, however this shouldn’t take away from the 54% who saw social data in a more strategic light. And after such a challenging year, why not see the glass as half full? Interested to learn more about how Twitter and our partners can support your social intelligence journey?

We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter. But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped. Because of this, on August 3, Fleets will no longer be available on Twitter. Using our learnings from Fleets, we’ll focus on creating other ways for people to join the conversation and talk about what’s happening in their world. Here’s some of what we learned and what’s next: Although we built Fleets to address some of the anxieties that hold people back from Tweeting, Fleets are mostly used by people who are already Tweeting to amplify their own Tweets and talk directly with others. We’ll explore more ways to address what holds people back from participating on Twitter. And for the people who already are Tweeting, we’re focused on making this better for you. Most Fleets include media – people enjoy quickly sharing photos and videos to add to the discussion on Twitter. Soon, we’ll test updates to the Tweet composer and camera to incorporate features from the Fleets composer – like the full-screen camera, text formatting options, and GIF stickers. The top of the timeline continues to be a good spot to highlight what’s happening right now so you’ll still see Spaces there when someone you follow is hosting or speaking in a live audio conversation. Our Fleet ads test, which concluded as planned last month, was one of our first explorations of full-screen, vertical format ads. We’re taking a close look at learnings to assess how these ads perform on Twitter. We’re evolving what Twitter is, and trying bigger, bolder things to serve the public conversation. A number of these updates, like Fleets, are speculative and won’t work out. We’ll be rigorous, evaluate what works, and know when to move on and focus elsewhere. If we're not evolving our approach and winding down features every once in a while – we're not taking big enough chances. We’ll continue to build new ways to participate in conversations, listening to feedback and changing direction when there may be a better way to serve people using Twitter."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/an-update-to-the-twitter-transparency-center","date":"2021-01-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Transparency","Company"],"title":"An update to the Twitter Transparency Center","text":"Transparency drives the work we do at Twitter and underpins our efforts to promote and protect the Open Internet around the world. Over the past year, we’ve experienced and continue to navigate severe global challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic. We’ve also seen concerted attempts by governments to limit access to the Internet generally and to Twitter specifically. Since 2012, the Twitter Transparency Report has offered a window into our work to enforce the Twitter Rules, protect privacy, navigate increased requests from governments around the world, disrupt state-backed information operations, and more. Now, amid an increasingly complex global landscape, continued transparency around our own efforts to protect the public conversation is paramount. Our latest Twitter Transparency Center update includes data from July 1 to December 31, 2020. While we continue to share data across consistent, recurring categories, we’re introducing new data that can provide meaningful insights into the impact of our actions. Our new impressions metric captures the number of views violative Tweets received prior to removal. We’re also including more information about the adoption of two-factor authentication, part of our work to keep accounts safe and secure. As we’ve noted previously, Twitter’s operations were severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the latter half of 2020, as was the case with the prior reporting period. Varying country-specific COVID-19 restrictions and adjustments within our teams affected the efficiency of our content moderation work and the speed with which we enforced our policies. We increased our use of machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially misleading and manipulative content. Like many organizations – both public and private around the world – the disruptions caused by COVID-19 made an impact on our company and are reflected in some of the data shared today. Impressions We’re committed to enabling safe and healthy conversations on the service, and we’re always looking for ways to share more context about our enforcement of the Twitter Rules. Our impressions metric captures the number of views a violative Tweet received prior to removal. In total, impressions on violative Tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of all impressions for all Tweets globally, from July 1 through December 31. During this time period, Twitter removed 3.8 million Tweets that violated the Twitter Rules; 77% of which received fewer than 100 impressions prior to removal, with an additional 17% receiving between 100 and 1,000 impressions. Only 6% of removed Tweets had more than 1,000 impressions. More broadly, as we work to remove harmful, violative content quickly and at scale, whether amid a global health crisis or during a high stakes election, these numbers represent both our present efficiency and where improvement is needed. Our goal is to improve these numbers over time, taking enforcement action on violative content before it’s even viewed. COVID-19 As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves around the world, we continue to take enforcement action on misleading information about COVID-19, particularly that which puts people at risk and could lead to harm. From July to December 2020, we challenged 10,320,924 accounts. The account challenge number represents a large volume of proactive anti-spam challenges we issued, targeting platform manipulation focused on COVID-19 discussions. We rolled out a set of proactive challenges specifically focused on COVID-19. We suspended 597 accounts, and removed 3,846 pieces of content. Since introducing our COVID-19 guidance last year, to the time of this publication, we have challenged 11.7 million accounts, suspended 1,496 accounts, and removed over 43,010 pieces of content worldwide. You can learn more about our COVID-19 misinformation policy here. Global legal requests Information Requests Protecting the privacy of people who use Twitter is important to us. We produced some or all of the requested information in response to 30% of these information requests; 4,367 total. India is the single largest source of government information requests, accounting for 25% of the global volume and 15% of the global accounts specified. The second highest volume of information requests originated from the United States, comprising 22% of global information requests. The United States submitted the highest volume of global emergency requests (34%), followed by Japan (17%), and South Korea (16%). Removal Requests (legal demands for content removal) During this reporting period, Twitter received 38,524 legal demands to remove content specifying 131,933 accounts. We withheld or otherwise removed some or all of the reported content in response to 29% of these global legal demands; 11,091 total. Although there was a 9% decrease in the number of legal demands Twitter received, compared to the previous reporting period, these requests sought removal of content from the largest number of accounts ever in a single reporting period. Accounts of 199 verified journalists and news outlets from around the world were subject to 361 legal demands, a 26% increase in these requests since the previous reporting period. And, 94% of the total global volume of legal demands originated from only five countries (in decreasing order): Japan, India, Russia, Turkey, and South Korea. Our reporting processes are designed to be transparent and to enable real accountability. Where possible, we provide user notice when we receive these requests. Importantly, unless we are prohibited from doing so, when we remove or withhold content in a certain country, Twitter will provide a copy of the request to the publicly available Lumen Database. When content is withheld, it is only withheld in the country making the removal demand and remains visible in all other jurisdictions. Twitter Rules enforcement We continue to step up the level of proactive enforcement across the service and invest in technological solutions to respond to ever-evolving malicious online activity. Today, by using technology, 65% of the abusive content we action is surfaced proactively for human review, instead of relying on reports from people using Twitter. Abuse and harassment We launched a number of initiatives, like more precise machine learning, to better detect and take action on content that violated this policy. As a result, there was a 142% increase in accounts actioned*, compared to the previous reporting period; 964,459 in total. Child sexual exploitation We do not tolerate child sexual exploitation (CSE) on Twitter. In the majority of cases, the consequence for violating our CSE policy is immediate and permanent suspension, and violators are prohibited from creating any new accounts in the future. Violative content is removed and reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). There was a 6% increase in the number of accounts suspended for violations of our child sexual exploitation policy during this reporting period. In total, 464,804 unique accounts were suspended, 90% of which were proactively identified by employing internal proprietary tools and industry hash sharing initiatives. Non-consensual nudity We took enforcement action on 27,087 accounts containing non-consensual nudity, an increase of 194% from the prior reporting period. From July to December 2020, we saw the largest increase in the number of accounts actioned under this policy. *\"Accounts actioned\" reflects the number of unique accounts that were suspended or required content removal for violating the Twitter Rules. Terrorism and violent extremism There was a 35% decrease in the number of accounts permanently suspended for violations of our terrorism and violent extremism policies – 96% of those accounts were proactively identified using a combination of machine learning and human review. Action was taken on 58,750 unique accounts under this policy during this reporting period. We continue to utilize and contribute to the shared industry hash database supported by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). Civic integrity Civic integrity policy enforcements increased significantly, by 175%, compared to the previous reporting period, largely driven by Tweets related to the United States 2020 election. During the United States 2020 election, we enacted a set of policy, enforcement and product changes to add context, encourage thoughtful consideration, and reduce the potential for misleading information to spread on Twitter. From October 27 to November 11, for example, we labeled approximately 300,000 Tweets that contained claims that were disputed and potentially misleading. Hateful conduct There was a 77% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our hateful conduct policy during this reporting period – from 635,415 accounts, to 1,126,990 accounts. In September 2020, we began enforcing our hateful conduct policy against content that incites fear and/or fearful stereotypes about protected categories, as we were seeing increased harassment of some protected categories during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, we further expanded our hateful conduct policy to include content that dehumanizes on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin. Promoting suicide & self-harm From July to December 2020, we actioned 188,561 accounts compared to 64,610 during the previous reporting period, accounting for a 192% increase in enforcement. Suicide and self-harm are significant social and public health challenges, and we recognize that we have a responsibility to help people access support when they need it. We continue to offer resources to support those experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, like our #ThereIsHelp search prompt. We’ve introduced new initiatives to better detect and take action on content that violates our policy on suicide and self-harm. Platform manipulation Anti-spam challenges increased by approximately 6% compared to the previous reporting period. In addition, we observed an approximate 14% decrease in the number of spam reports from the previous reporting period. Copyright Submissions of Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices decreased by 2%, and we saw a 44% decrease in accounts affected. Tweets withheld and media withheld also dropped by 25% and 43% respectively, as Twitter’s operations were affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a security incident in July 2020. Account security We continue to encourage two-factor authentication (2FA) for all accounts, and a number of other best practices to help keep accounts safe and secure. Over time, we hope to see more people on Twitter adopt enhanced security measures for their accounts. Approximately 2.3% of accounts have enabled at least one 2FA method during the reporting period. Conclusion We’re committed to increasing our transparency and improving our accountability to you, the public, and we’ll continue to publish updates to the Twitter Transparency Center on a biannual basis. Follow @Policy and @TwitterSafety for updates on our policies and our work on transparency throughout the year."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-responsible-machine-learning-initiative","date":"2021-01-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Engineering","Product","Technology","Company"],"title":"Introducing our Responsible Machine Learning Initiative","text":"The journey to responsible, responsive, and community-driven machine learning (ML) systems is a collaborative one. Today, we want to share more about the work we’ve been doing to improve our ML algorithms within Twitter, and our path forward through a company-wide initiative called Responsible ML. Responsible ML consists of the following pillars: Taking responsibility for our algorithmic decisions Equity and fairness of outcomes Transparency about our decisions and how we arrived at them Enabling agency and algorithmic choice Responsible technological use includes studying the effects it can have over time. When Twitter uses ML, it can impact hundreds of millions of Tweets per day and sometimes, the way a system was designed to help could start to behave differently than was intended. These subtle shifts can then start to impact the people using Twitter and we want to make sure we’re studying those changes and using them to build a better product. Who’s involved and the actions we're taking Technical solutions alone do not resolve the potential harmful effects of algorithmic decisions. Our Responsible ML working group is interdisciplinary and is made up of people from across the company, including technical, research, trust and safety, and product teams. Leading this work is our ML Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team: a dedicated group of engineers, researchers, and data scientists collaborating across the company to assess downstream or current unintentional harms in the algorithms we use and to help Twitter prioritize which issues to tackle first. Here’s how we’re approaching this initiative: Researching and understanding the impact of ML decisions. We’re conducting in-depth analysis and studies to assess the existence of potential harms in the algorithms we use. Here are some analyses you will have access to in the upcoming months: A gender and racial bias analysis of our image cropping (saliency) algorithm A fairness assessment of our Home timeline recommendations across racial subgroups An analysis of content recommendations for different political ideologies across seven countries Applying our learnings to improve Twitter. The most impactful applications of responsible ML will come from how we apply our learnings to build a better Twitter. The META team works to study how our systems work and uses those findings to improve the experience people have on Twitter. This may result in changing our product, such as removing an algorithm and giving people more control over the images they Tweet, or in new standards into how we design and build policies when they have an outsized impact on one particular community. The results of this work may not always translate into visible product changes, but it will lead to heightened awareness and important discussions around the way we build and apply ML. We’re also building explainable ML solutions so you can better understand our algorithms, what informs them, and how they impact what you see on Twitter. Similarly, algorithmic choice will allow people to have more input and control in shaping what they want Twitter to be for them. We’re currently in the early stages of exploring this and will share more soon. Sharing our learnings and asking for feedback. Both inside and outside of Twitter, we will share our learnings and best practices to improve the industry’s collective understanding of this topic, help us improve our approach, and hold us accountable. This may come in the form of peer-reviewed research, data-insights, high-level descriptions of our findings or approaches, and even some of our unsuccessful attempts to address these emerging challenges. We’ll continue to work closely with third party academic researchers to identify ways we can improve our work and encourage their feedback. The public plays a critical role in shaping Twitter and ResponsibleML is no different. Public feedback is particularly important as we assess the fairness and equity of the automated systems we use. Better, more informed decisions are made when the people who use Twitter are part of the process, and we’re looking to create more opportunities for people to share their thoughts on how ML is used on Twitter. What’s Next? Responsible ML is a long journey in its early days. We want to explore it with a spirit of openness with the goal of contributing positively to the field of technology ethics. If you have any questions about Responsible ML, or the work META’s doing, feel free to ask us using #AskTwitterMETA.

This year, multiple challenging circumstances will require that most people experience this historic ceremony virtually. As Twitter will serve as both a venue for people to watch and talk about this political event, and play a key role in facilitating the transfer of official government communication channels, we want to be transparent and clear about what people should expect to see on the platform. Protecting the public conversation In our January 12 update following the riots in Washington, DC, we outlined the steps we’re taking to protect the public conversation on Twitter from attempts to incite violence, organize attacks, and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome. These efforts, including our open lines of communication with law enforcement, will continue through the inauguration and will adapt as needed if circumstances change in real-time. Watching Inauguration 2021 live People on Twitter will be able to watch the inauguration ceremony and the coverage surrounding it via live streams from multiple news outlets and official inauguration feeds, including @JCCIC and @BidenInaugural, through Twitter’s US Elections Hub. Alongside the livestream of inauguration events, the hub will also include curated Moments, Lists and accounts-to-follow recommendations from trusted and official sources. Transferring Institutional White House Twitter accounts As we did in 2017, Twitter is actively working with the US government to support the archival and transition of Twitter accounts across administrations. As President-elect Biden is sworn in on January 20, 2021, Twitter will facilitate the transfer of institutional White House Twitter accounts, including: @WhiteHouse, @POTUS, @VP, @FLOTUS, and @PressSec. First, Twitter will transfer current institutional accounts to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) where the Tweets and account history will remain publicly available and the account usernames will be updated to reflect their archived status. For example, the Trump administration’s @POTUS account will be publicly archived as @POTUS45, just as the Obama administration’s account was archived as @POTUS44. Once this archival process is completed, Twitter will transfer the institutional accounts to the Biden administration to assume ownership, along with a new account: @SecondGentleman. People on Twitter will be able to watch the transition of power take place in real-time as accounts for the White House, President, Vice President, First Lady and White House Press Secretary inherit their new institutional usernames: @Transition46 will become @WhiteHouse, @PresElectBiden will become @POTUS, @SenKamalaHarris will become @VP, @FLOTUSBiden will become @FLOTUS, and @PressSecPsaki will become @PressSec. The Tweets, account history, and followers will transition between these accounts. These institutional accounts will not automatically retain the followers from the prior administration. People on Twitter who previously followed institutional White House Twitter accounts, or who currently follow relevant Biden or Harris Twitter accounts, will receive in-app alerts and other prompts that will notify them about the archival process, as well as give them the option to follow the new administration’s Twitter accounts. The new institutional accounts will also be listed in Twitter’s US Elections Hub during the presidential inauguration. You can follow along with @TwitterGov, @Policy and @TwitterMoments, where we will continue to share updates and information on #Inauguration2021."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/inclusion-and-diversity-report-multifaceted-approach-october-2021","date":"2021-01-12T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Diversity","#UntilWeAllBelong","Company"],"title":"Inclusion & Diversity Q3 2021: Our multifaceted approach","text":"At this point in 2021, we know there is no going back to the way things were before the pandemic. While companies reevaluate office reopenings and new ways of working, countries continue to deal with the soaring COVID-19 cases and challenges associated with vaccine access and uptake. This year is a solid reminder that our approach to what’s ahead requires a new way of thinking. At Twitter, we’ve made strides. We’ve become a more distributed, more global Tweepforce, putting our Tweeps in the center and prioritizing flexibility and choice in how we work. We also recognize that it’s more complex than this, and collectively we’ve got work to do to build a truly inclusive culture. Looking at our 2025 vision, we’re proud of the increases in women globally and Black and Latinx U.S. representation this quarter. View our latest numbers on our Careers site. While attracting and retaining talent is a top priority, we know this work takes more than any one initiative or company –– it takes all of us. At Twitter, we take a multifaceted approach that embeds our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) principles across all aspects of the business. Today, I want to share, in closer detail, three important pillars driving progress across Twitter: Diversity Partnership Strategy & Engagement, Supplier Diversity, and Diversifying Corporate Development Investments & Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A). Initially kicking off in the US, we’re excited to expand many of these initiatives around the world in the future. Diversity Partnership Strategy & Engagement Earlier this year, we introduced #TwitterIgnite, a program from our Diversity Partnership Strategy & Engagement (DPS) team to elevate diverse communities and ignite change. We started by engaging partners from civil rights organizations, Historically Black Colleges, Non-Governmental Organizations, and the National Pan-Hellenic Council, with three objectives in mind: Ignite conversation Many companies continue to reel and navigate current events, and many of our nonprofit partners that serve hard-hit communities have valuable insights to offer. That’s why we created the #TwitterIgnite video series featuring timely and relevant topics that bridge conversation in the workplace and society, including #StopAsianHate, #LiftEveryVoice, #MandelaMile, #AlwaysProud. During the summer, we also invited many leaders from these organizations to host conversations on our service for #Juneteenth. We will continue to ignite conversation about issues impacting diverse communities like a recent intersectional conversation at the DEIB conference with leaders of League of United Latin American Citizens, Ford Foundation, National Action Network, and National Black Justice Coalition. Ignite action We recognize harnessing the power of public conversation can create action. We’re leaning into that by empowering partners to more effectively use Twitter to elevate their work and go deeper in regional and local markets. Starting with 10 cities in the US, we are partnering with local chapters of national organizations and grassroots organizations by providing digital campaign support. We continue to identify new opportunities and support campaigns that amplify the work on the ground and empower communities and allies to participate––in person, on Twitter, and where change is likely to happen. Ignite change When we launched our external Intersectionality, Culture, & Diversity (ICD) Council in 2018, our focus was to anticipate, discuss, and share solutions to ongoing issues in society and the workplace. Since then, our work has evolved toward driving systemic change across our industry while answering the call to social justice and how it shows up across the workplace. This required collaboration beyond our walls and respective organizations. With our ICD council and partners, we are identifying barriers to inclusion through research, spotlighting best practices, and identifying recommendations to move workplace solutions to industry solutions. This #IgniteChange collaboration with Forum on Workplace Inclusion focuses on six industries: Academia, Banking/Finance, Criminal Justice, Education, and Technology. And while we’re proud of our initiatives in the US, we also acknowledge the need to expand our reach. This year, we’ve started with an initial focus on our EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa). We are currently developing our strategy for three target markets (the UK, Ireland, and Ghana) as we continue to expand the #TwitterIgnite program globally. Supplier Diversity In 2019, Twitter established our Supplier Inclusion & Diversity (SI&D) program to leverage the power of Twitter to drive equity and inclusion in our supplier identification, selection, and purchasing processes. While we have only recently started our SI&D program, over the last two years, we have made significant progress in setting the foundation with our US Suppliers for what we eventually intend to be a global and industry-leading program. Some of our key milestones include enabling suppliers to self-identify diverse ownership classification as part of our onboarding process, developing spend reporting capabilities, and nurturing well-established relationships with key community organizations that support our ability to achieve our goals. We have also begun to engage our suppliers by launching an I&D Supplier Survey to understand better our suppliers’ commitment to the workplace, workforce, and supplier diversity. Each of these initiatives help us lay a foundation to increase investments across underrepresented communities, create spend-equity, increase the utilization of the Twitter platform, and practice transparency by externally sharing our progress and plans. Building on our foundation this year, we're proud to have implemented a number of initiatives at Twitter, such as introducing diverse spend goals by team, quarterly spend reporting, and connecting suppliers to our teams through monthly showcases. By attending these showcases, suppliers learn about our supplier needs and how to leverage Twitter’s service to benefit their business. So far, we have seen an increase in SI&D spend of over 65% compared to 2020, and our supplier sessions have connected with over 150 potential suppliers that we can consider for future opportunities. Looking forward, by 2025, we intend to: Double our spend with suppliers from historically excluded communities. Expand our program to represent our global footprint. Create the ability to measure our economic impact in these communities. Share our progress and plans across the industry. The work will be intensive, complex, and sometimes disruptive. Still, it will give Twitter the ability to deliver an even greater impact on and benefit from the power of these communities of suppliers. Diversifying Corporate Development Investments & Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) Our Corporate Development & Strategy Team (Corp Dev) team plays an important role in helping the company reach its 2025 Tweepforce representation targets. It also acts as a force multiplier to invest in women, Black, and Latinx founders. Developing these relationships and diversifying our M&A pipeline not only helps accelerate our diverse workforce representation progress, but it also serves as a model for other companies that wish to engage in this critical work. In early discussions about a potential acquisition, companies and their founders share more about their strategies and practices for building and nurturing diverse talent and teams. We also incorporate diverse interview panels within Twitter (aiming for two out of three interviewers to be women, Black, and/or Latinx) as part of our vetting progress. When reviewing the opportunity, our leadership reviews the data to evaluate if the target company would further progress our Tweepforce representation goals.These practices bring explicit awareness to the impact on I&D commitments of the teams we vet and onboard as potential acquisition targets. This year Corp Dev invested in women, Black, and Latinx founder-led companies and funds that support historically excluded communities. Before making these investments, Corp Dev will meet with early-stage venture funds with the specific mission of investing in historically excluded communities and women founders. Ultimately, these meetings will improve the diversity of our startup pipeline and provide visibility into other communities with whom we’ve yet to engage. As of June 30, our team met with 65+ funds to help them understand our objectives, learn about how they support the communities we seek to invest in, get their feedback on our thinking, and identify areas and startups that overlap with Twitter focus areas. In May, we announced our first investments to three venture capital funds: @MacVentureCap —led by @MarlonCNichols, @adrianfenty, @IAmCharlesDKing, and @mpalank101, focuses on supporting excellent founders and early stage companies and are well positioned and passionate about shaking up the status quo in the tech industry. @Uluventures, a longstanding seed stage fund built by @miriamulu1 and @ckorver, focuses on finding and funding diverse teams and has a demonstrable strategy and track record that drives outsized returns. @VamosVentures is built by a Latinx investment team that emphasizes supporting technology-enabled companies led by Latinx founders. They understand how startup ecosystems are being built and fostered across diverse communities in the U.S. In July we announced three additional fund investments: @fcubedvc was founded by Anu Duggal and @sutiandong on the belief that investing exclusively in women is a tremendous investment opportunity to deliver outsized returns. Beyond offering capital to female founders, the fund’s vision is to create an ecosystem of resources and community for women founders and operators. @HannahGreyVC, founded by @kshillo and @jessicapeltz, focuses on changes in consumer and worker behavior from overlooked populations that create outsized market opportunities. The founders have spent more than a decade supporting diverse founders at their previous funds. @ChingonaVC focuses on industries that are massively changing and founders whose backgrounds uniquely position them to create businesses in growth markets that are often overlooked. Continuing Our Journey Our multifaceted approach will help us continue to hold ourselves accountable against our I&D goals while leveraging the power of Twitter to expand our impact. While there have been nonstop curveballs since announcing our bold 2025 goals back in January 2020, we continue to prioritize staying on course to make Twitter the most inclusive, diverse, and accessible tech company. This work is a journey, and thanks to our committed Tweepforce, we won’t stop #UntilWeAllBelong."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/establishing-twitter-s-presence-in-africa","date":"2021-01-11T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Localization","Reach","Society & Culture","Team","Company"],"title":"Establishing Twitter's presence in Africa","text":"Twitter’s mission is to serve the public conversation, and it’s essential, for the world and for Twitter, to increase the number of people who feel comfortable participating in it. To do this, we need to make it easier for everyone to join in and provide more relevant experiences for people across the world. Today, in line with our growth strategy, we’re excited to announce that we are now actively building a team in Ghana. To truly serve the public conversation, we must be more immersed in the rich and vibrant communities that drive the conversations taking place every day across the African continent. We are looking for specialists to join several teams including product, design, engineering, marketing and communications. Full details on current job openings can be found on the Twitter Careers site. Aligned with our existing WFH policies, we look forward to welcoming and onboarding our new team members remotely so that we can make an immediate impact while we explore the opportunity to open an office in Ghana in the future. Why Ghana? As a champion for democracy, Ghana is a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate. Furthermore, Ghana’s recent appointment to host The Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area aligns with our overarching goal to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa. Whenever we enter new markets, we work hard to ensure that we are not just investing in the talent that we hire, but also investing in local communities and the social fabric that supports them. We have already laid foundations through partnerships with Amref Health Africa in Kenya, Afrochella in Ghana, Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI) in Nigeria, and The HackLab Foundation in Ghana. As part of our long-term commitment to the region, we’ll continue to explore compelling ways we can use the positive power of Twitter to strengthen our communities through employee engagement, platform activation, and corporate giving. We still have much to learn but we are excited to listen, learn, and engage. Public conversation is essential to solving problems, building shared ideas, and pushing us all forward together.

March 20, 2020 COVID-19 account verification March 4, 2020 Global expansion of the COVID-19 search prompt Launched six days before the official designation of the virus in January 2020, we continue to expand our dedicated search prompt feature to ensure that when you come to the service for information about COVID-19, you are met with credible, authoritative content at the top of search. We have been consistently monitoring the conversation on the service to make sure keywords — including common misspellings — also generate the search prompt. In each country where we have launched the initiative, we have partnered with the national public health agency or the World Health Organization (@WHO) directly. The proactive search prompt is in place with official local partnerships in more than 70 countries around the world. They include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, and Yemen.

January 29, 2020 Launch of a new dedicated #KnowTheFacts search prompt As the global conversation continues around the spread of COVID-19, we want to share the work we’re doing to surface the right information, to promote constructive engagement, and to highlight credible information on this emerging issue. We’ve seen tens of millions of Tweets on this topic in the past four weeks and that trend looks set to continue. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the issue and the growing international response, we’ve launched a new dedicated search prompt to ensure that when you come to the service for information about the #coronavirus, you’re met with credible, authoritative information first. In addition, we’re halting any auto-suggest results that are likely to direct individuals to noncredible content on Twitter. This is an expansion of our Know the facts prompt, which we specifically put in place for the public to find clear, credible information on immunization and vaccination health. Our official #coronavirus partnerships are now in place in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, and Yemen. Direct engagement with organizations working to contain the threat Finally, our Global Public Policy team is proactively seeking ways to integrate the product with organizations involved in the effort to contain the threat. Experts, NGOs, and governments play a pivotal public service role, using Twitter to reach people with the right information when they need it. We’re committed to playing our part to amplify authoritative, official content across the globe. For more, please follow @TwitterGov and @Policy, where we will provide updates as appropriate. Read the original post. Back to top 2. Protecting the public conversation July 14, 2020 Clarifying how we assess misleading information Today we are further clarifying our rules against potentially misleading information about COVID-19. This update includes additional details on what factors we take into account when considering content for removal. Our primary goal with addressing misleading information about COVID-19 has not changed. We will continue to remove demonstrably false or potentially misleading content that has the highest risk of causing harm. However, we are providing additional details about our framework for evaluating a potentially misleading claim, including when we would or would not require Tweets to include an explicit call to action (e.g. “everyone should stop wearing masks!”) in order to take action. When evaluating whether or not to remove the most harmful misinformation on our platform, we consider three criteria: 1. Is the content advancing a claim of fact regarding COVID-19? For a Tweet to qualify as a misleading claim, it must be an assertion of fact (not an opinion), expressed definitively, and intended to influence others’ behavior. Some examples include information about: the origin, nature, and characteristics of the virus; preventative measures, treatments/cures, and other precautions; the prevalence of viral spread, or the current state of the crisis; official health advisories, restrictions, regulations, and public-service announcements; how vulnerable communities are affected by/responding to the pandemic. 2. Is the claim demonstrably false or misleading? Under this policy, we consider claims to be false or misleading if (1) they have been confirmed to be false by subject-matter experts, such as public health authorities; or (2) they include information which is shared in a way that could confuse or deceive people. Some of the factors we consider include: Whether the content of the Tweet, including media, has been significantly altered, manipulated, doctored, or fabricated; Whether claims are presented improperly or out of context; Whether claims shared in a Tweet are widely accepted by experts to be inaccurate or false. 3. Would belief in this information, as presented, lead to harm? We will not be able to take enforcement action on every Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19. Our focus in the COVID-19 policy is narrowed to address those claims that could adversely impact an individual, group, or community. We are most concerned with misleading information that: May increase the likelihood of exposure to the virus; May have adverse effects on the public health system’s capacity to cope with the crisis; Could lead to discrimination and avoidance of communities and/or places of business based on their perceived affiliation with protected groups. COVID-19 related content that meet all three of the criteria defined above—i.e. that are claims of fact, demonstrably false or misleading, and likely to cause harm—may not be shared on Twitter and are subject to removal. Accounts that break this rule repeatedly may be permanently suspended. Further details about some of the most common types of misleading claims which we will remove under this policy are provided below. We may label or place a warning on tweets to provide additional context in situations where the risks of harm associated with a Tweet are less severe but where people may still be confused or misled. This will make it easier to find facts and make informed decisions about what people see on Twitter. In line with our existing enforcement approach, Tweets that are labeled under this expanded guidance will have reduced visibility across the service. Reducing the visibility of Tweets means that we will not amplify the Tweets on a number of surfaces across Twitter. However, anyone following the account will still be able to see the Tweet and Retweet. The world has changed since this pandemic was first declared and public health experts, medical professionals, scientists and researchers now know more about how we can best stay safe and healthy. As the situation evolves and as global health advisories shift to cope with the pandemic, we are committed to ensuring our rules and enforcement actions reflect that evolution. May 11, 2020 Updating our approach to misleading information In serving the public conversation, our goal is to make it easy to find credible information on Twitter and to limit the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content. Starting today, we’re introducing new labels and warning messages that will provide additional context and information on some Tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to COVID-19. For more information see the full update to our approach on misleading information here. April 22, 2020 Broadening our guidance on unverified claims Going forward and specific to COVID-19, unverified claims that have the potential to incite people to action, could lead to the destruction or damage of critical infrastructure, or cause widespread panic/social unrest may be considered a violation of our policies. Examples include, “The National Guard just announced that no more shipments of food will be arriving for two months — run to the grocery store ASAP and buy everything” or “5G causes coronavirus — go destroy the cell towers in your neighborhood!\". Our ads policy for COVID-19 In response to the shifting advertising landscape, and in order to support helpful causes during this time, we're now allowing managed clients and partners to advertise content containing implicit or explicit reference to COVID-19 in the following use cases, with restrictions: Adjustments to business practices and/or models in response to COVID-19 Support for customers and employees related to COVID-19 The following restrictions apply to these use cases: Distasteful references to COVID-19 (or variations) are prohibited Content may not be sensational or likely to incite panic Prices of products related to COVID-19 may not be inflated The promotion of certain products related to COVID-19 may be prohibited. We currently prohibit the advertising of medical facemasks and alcohol hand sanitizers. Please note that other products may be added to this list and enforcement can be retroactive. The mention of vaccines, treatments and test kits is permitted, only in the form of information, from news publishers which have been exempted under the Political Ads Content policy. Read more about the policy. For more COVID-19 Twitter resources for advertisers, visit marketing.twitter.com/covid19. April 1, 2020 Broadening our definition of \"harm\" We have broadened our definition of harm to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. Rather than reports, we are enforcing this in close coordination with trusted partners, including public health authorities and governments, and continue to use and consult with information from those sources when reviewing content. We’ll continue to prioritize removing content when it has a clear call to action that could directly pose a risk to people’s health or well-being, but we want to make it clear that we will not be able to take enforcement action on every Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19. This is not meant to limit good faith discussion or expressing hope about ongoing studies related to potential medical interventions that show promise. Since introducing these policies on March 18, we have removed more than 1,100 Tweets containing misleading and potentially harmful content from Twitter. Additionally, our automated systems have challenged more than 1.5 million accounts which were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviors. We will continue to use both technology and our teams to help us identify and stop spammy behavior and accounts. We may also apply the public interest notice in cases where world leaders violate the COVID-19 guidelines. Automated technology and what to expect if you file a report How are we using automated technology during this time? To help us review reports more efficiently by surfacing content that's most likely to cause harm and should be reviewed first. To help us proactively identify rule-breaking content before it's reported. Our systems learn from past decisions by our review teams, so over time, the technology is able to help us rank content or challenge accounts automatically. For content that requires additional context, such as misleading information around COVID-19, our teams will continue to review those reports manually. What you can expect if you file a report during this time: If you've reported an account or Tweet to us, it will take longer than normal for us to get back to you. We appreciate your patience as we continue to make adjustments. Because these automated systems don't have all of the context and insight our team has, we’ll make mistakes. If you think we’ve made a mistake, you can let us know and appeal here. We appreciate your patience as we work to keep our teams safe, while also making sure we're protecting everyone on Twitter. You can always continue to use hide replies, mute, block, reply filters, and the other tools we offer you to control conversations on the service. Read the original post. March 27, 2020 An update on our content moderation work We have broadened our definition of harm to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. Rather than reports, we are enforcing this in close coordination with trusted partners, including public health authorities and governments, and continue to use and consult with information from those sources when reviewing content. Under this guidance, we will require people to remove Tweets that include: Statements which are intended to influence others to violate recommended COVID-19 related guidance from global or local health authorities to decrease someone’s likelihood of exposure to COVID-19, such as: “social distancing is not effective,” or “now that it’s summertime, you don’t need a mask anymore, so don’t wear your mask!” Note: We will not require the removal of Tweets that include information about or encouragement to participate in demonstrations or protests. Misleading claims that unharmful but ineffective methods are cures or absolute treatments for COVID-19, such as “Coronavirus is vulnerable to UV radiation - walking outside in bright sunlight will prevent COVID-19.” Description of harmful treatments or preventative measures which are known to be ineffective or are being shared out of context to mislead people, such as “drinking bleach and ingesting colloidal silver will cure COVID-19.” Denial of established scientific facts about transmission during the incubation period or transmission guidance from global and local health authorities, such as “COVID-19 does not infect children because we haven’t seen any cases of children being sick.” False or misleading information that would allow the reader to diagnose themselves as either having or not having COVID-19, such as “If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you don’t have coronavirus.” Unverified claims that have the potential to incite people to action, could lead to the destruction or damage of critical infrastructure, or could lead to widespread panic/social unrest may be considered a violation of our policies. Examples include, “The National Guard just announced that no more shipments of food will be arriving for two months — run to the grocery store ASAP and buy everything” or “5G causes coronavirus — #BURN5G.” Tweets offering the sale or facilitation of non-prescription treatments/cures for COVID-19, or those which advertise cures or treatments for COVID-19 that require a prescription or physician consultation. Specific and unverified claims made by people impersonating a government or health official or organization such as a parody account of official public health advisors claiming that hydroxychloroquine will prevent COVID-19. Claims that specific groups or nationalities are never susceptible to COVID-19, such as “people with dark skin are immune to COVID-19 due to melanin production” or are more susceptible, such as “avoid businesses owned by Chinese people as they are more likely to have COVID-19.” March 16, 2020 Our use of automated technology We have increased our use of machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially abusive and manipulative content. We want to be clear: while we work to ensure our systems are consistent, they can sometimes lack the context that our teams bring, and this may result in us making mistakes. As a result, we will not permanently suspend any accounts based solely on our automated enforcement systems. Instead, we will continue to look for opportunities to build in human review checks where they will be most impactful. We appreciate your patience as we work to get it right — this is a necessary step to scale our work to protect the conversation on Twitter. Additional triage, quality assurance, and our ongoing review of Twitter Rules Here are a few more things we are doing to protect the public conversation: Building systems that enable our team to continue to enforce our rules remotely around the world. We’re also increasing our employee assistance and wellness support for everyone involved in this critical work, and ensuring people’s privacy and security stay a top priority. Instituting a global content severity triage system so we are prioritizing the potential rule violations that present the biggest risk of harm and reducing the burden on people to report them. Executing daily quality assurance checks on our content enforcement processes to ensure we’re agile in responding to this rapidly evolving, global disease outbreak. Engaging with our partners around the world to ensure escalation paths remain open and urgent cases can be brought to our attention. Continuing to review the Twitter Rules in the context of COVID-19 and considering ways in which they may need to evolve to account for new behaviors. As we’ve said on many occasions, our approach to protecting the public conversation is never static. That’s particularly relevant in these unprecedented times. We intend to review our thinking daily and will ensure we’re sharing updates here on any new clarifications to our rules or major changes to how we’re enforcing them. Finally, we’re encouraged that our service is being used around the world to provide free, authoritative health information, and to ensure that everyone has access to the conversations they need to protect themselves and their families. For more, our dedicated COVID-19 Event page has the latest facts right at the top of your timeline, and we’ll continue to share updates @TwitterSafety and @TwitterSupport. March 4, 2020 Our zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation The power of a uniquely open service during a public health emergency is clear. The speed and borderless nature of Twitter presents an extraordinary opportunity to get the word out and ensure people have access to the latest information from expert sources around the world. To support that mission, our global Trust & Safety team is continuing its zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to abuse our service at this critical juncture. At present, we’re not seeing significant coordinated platform manipulation efforts around these issues. However, we will remain vigilant and have invested substantially in our proactive abilities to ensure trends, search, and other common areas of the service are protected from malicious behaviors. As ever, we also welcome constructive and open information sharing from governments and academics to further our work in these areas — we’re in this together. January 29, 2020 Preventing platform manipulation As the global conversation continues around the spread of COVID-19, we want to share the work we’re doing to surface the right information, to promote constructive engagement, and to highlight credible information on this emerging issue. At present, we’re not seeing significant coordinated attempts to spread disinformation at scale about this issue. However, we will remain vigilant and have invested significantly in our proactive abilities to ensure trends, search, and other common areas of the service are protected from malicious behaviors. As ever, those who engage in these practices will be removed from our service. We do not permit platform manipulation and we encourage people to think before sharing or engaging in deliberate attempts to undermine the public conversation. Read the original post. Back to top April 10, 2020 Resources for those battling substance abuse disorders, in recovery As people across the country and around the world #StayHome to slow the spread of #COVID19, it’s imperative we think about the significant impact these measures have on those experiencing substance use disorders and those in recovery. In partnership with Center for Safe Internet Pharmacies, Twitter is building on its collaboration with Google, Facebook, and Microsoft to showcase a variety of resources on TechTogether.co to support the #RecoveryMovement. The site is a collection of resources to help those experiencing a substance use disorder and the associated stigma. April 7, 2020 #WorldHealthDay Clapping for our healthcare heroes Twitter Q&A with the World Health Organization April 2, 2020 #AsktheGov & #AsktheMayor Twitter Q&As State and local elected officials across America are using Twitter to consistently provide factual information and resources to their constituents and the broader public around #COVID19. To optimize and elevate this work, Twitter organized two nationwide events where governors and mayors answered constituent questions through Twitter Q&As. These #AsktheGov and #AsktheMayor events provided an opportunity for hundreds of Americans to receive direct answers from their elected leaders and allowed millions of people to access those critical resources and information. March 24, 2020 Supporting the #BuildforCovid19 Hackathon Twitter supports the COVID-19 Global Hackathon, an opportunity for developers to build software solutions that drive social impact with the aim of tackling some of the challenges related to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. All around the world, we’ve seen our service connecting people with the authoritative health information they need to protect themselves and their loved ones. That work can only be successful if people have access to the news and information they need. Right now, every journalist is a COVID-19 journalist. From the stories of healthcare workers on the front lines, to analysis of the real human and economic cost of the pandemic, reporters around the world are still writing, still exposing themselves to harm, still giving us the facts. Journalism is core to our service and we have a deep and enduring responsibility to protect that work. This week we’re contributing to two critical organizations that are working tirelessly to uphold the fundamental values of a free press during this pandemic. We’re donating 1 million dollars evenly distributed between the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Women’s Media Foundation. These funds will be used to ensure these organizations can continue their work in the face of new economic strains and to directly support journalists. Their shared efforts to advocate for the rights of vulnerable reporters and to guarantee an equal share of voice for women in the industry has never been more relevant or important. We are grateful for Twitter’s generous support. Our efforts at CPJ are focused on ensuring that journalists around the world have the information and resources they need to cover the COVID-19 pandemic safely. And we are pushing back against governments that are censoring the news, and restricting the work of the press. We need timely, accurate information flowing within countries and across borders so that political leaders, health policy experts, and the public at large can make informed decisions at this critical moment. Joel Simon Executive Director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) Right now, there is a great need to support our community of journalists covering, and dealing with, this global pandemic. Based on our decades of work with journalists who operate in dangerous and difficult environments, the IWMF understands the critical role that safety and security plays in the industry. Thanks to the incredible support of Twitter, the IWMF will be able to address the needs of our community of journalists more deeply and robustly. By supporting journalists from diverse communities, together we can support the most representative news possible in this evolving time. Elisa Lees Muñoz Executive Director, International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF) COVID-19 has been with us for months but the power of the virus is now being felt on all corners of the globe. We’re witnessing real-time public conversation on an issue that connects us all on a core human level and our purpose has never been stronger. We will continue to work with our partners as the crisis evolves and are grateful for their journalistic leadership and commitment to the power of the pen. For more, please follow @TwitterForGood, @pressfreedom, and @IWMF. Read the original post. March 16, 2020 Working together with government and industry peers to keep people safe We’re working with our peer companies and fellow industry leaders in the US to keep people safe and stop the spread of COVID-19. Through this collaboration, we’re working to elevate authoritative health information and provide resources for the most vulnerable populations. To see a hub of online resources and an overview of the work from Internet Association members, visit covid19.internetassociation.org. Here’s more on our collaboration with peer companies and the government: March 13, 2020 Promoting proper handwashing with the #SafeHands emoji March 4, 2020 Building partnerships to protect the public conversation Our entire company is stepping up its internal and external efforts to build partnerships, protect the public conversation, help people find authoritative health information, raise relief funds, and contribute pro bono advertising support to ensure people are getting the right message, from the right source. With a critical mass of expert organizations, official government accounts, health professionals, and epidemiologists on our service, our goal is to elevate and amplify authoritative health information as far as possible. Global expansion of the COVID-19 search prompt Launched six days before the official designation of the virus in January, we continue to expand our dedicated search prompt feature to ensure that when you come to the service for information about COVID-19, you are met with credible, authoritative content at the top of your search experience. We have been consistently monitoring the conversation on the service to make sure keywords — including common misspellings — also generate the search prompt. In each country where we have launched the initiative, we have partnered with the national public health agency or the World Health Organization (@WHO) directly. The proactive search prompt is in place with official local partnerships in more than 70 countries around the world. They include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, and Yemen. #AdsForGood support and additional protections Based on our Inappropriate Content Policy, we will halt any attempt by advertisers to opportunistically use the COVID-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads. Government entities that want to disseminate public health information will be permitted to promote ads on COVID-19. In the case of COVID-19, we have put additional safeguards into place in order to facilitate the sharing of trusted public health information and to reduce potential harm to users. We are currently prohibiting the promotion of all medical masks and alcohol hand sanitizers due to strong correlation to COVID-19 and instances of inflated prices globally. In addition, we’re committing Ads for Good credits to nonprofit organizations to ensure they can build campaigns to fact-check and get reputable health information to the widest possible audiences. For example, as part of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN/@factchecknet), we have supported the Spanish organization @maldita_es and @malditobulo, which focuses on mitigating the impact of disinformation on public discourse through fact-checking and data journalism techniques. In Asia, we have partnered with the Taiwan Fact Checking Center (@taiwantfc), which has been using Twitter to connect with IFCN fact checkers around the world via #CoronavirusFacts. They are working in real time to find credible information and debunk rumors in Chinese. Furthering our partnerships Our Global Public Policy team has open lines of communication with relevant multinational stakeholders, including the World Health Organization, numerous global government and public health organizations, and officials around the world, to ensure they can troubleshoot account issues, get their experts verified, and seek strategic counsel as they use the power of Twitter to mitigate harm. We’re also in close contact with our industry peers and will attend all relevant cross-functional meetings. As a uniquely open service, our data is being used in research every day and our researchers hub is publicly available. We welcome applications for the use of Twitter data to support research on COVID-19. We will also explore further #DataForGood partnerships to assess how our data products can enhance academic and NGO understanding of public health emergencies now and into the future. Donation matching We've set up a dedicated internal COVID-19 campaign page through our employee donation matching program to support humanitarian response and relief efforts around the world. Any Twitter employee can donate to relevant nonprofit organizations, and Twitter will match donations up to $2,000 per employee. What can you do? Looking for advice on how best to use Twitter in a time like this? Follow @WHO and your local health ministry — seek out the authoritative health information and ignore the noise. See something suspicious or abusive, report it to us immediately. Most importantly, think before you Tweet. Through Twitter Moments, we have curated longer-form content that helps tell the full story of what’s happening around COVID-19 globally. For educators and parents, consult our media literacy guide, which was built in partnership with @UNESCO, here. We’re absolutely committed to playing our part and will continue to provide substantive updates as this situation evolves. For more, follow @TwitterSafety and @Policy. Read the original post. Back to top 4. Empowering Research of COVID-19 on Twitter April 29, 2020 Enabling study of the public conversation in a time of crisis To further support Twitter’s ongoing efforts to protect the public conversation, and help people find authoritative health information around COVID-19, we’re releasing a new endpoint into Twitter Developer Labs to enable approved developers and researchers to study the public conversation about COVID-19 in real-time. The COVID-19 stream endpoint provides access to COVID-19 and Coronavirus related public Tweets in real-time as defined by the criteria used to power this topic on Twitter. This is a unique dataset that covers many tens of millions of Tweets daily and offers insight into the evolving global public conversation surrounding an unprecedented crisis. Making this access available for free is one of the most unique and valuable things Twitter can do as the world comes together to protect our communities and seek answers to pressing challenges. You can read more about this endpoint and the application process on our developer blog. Back to top 5. Ensuring site reliability How we're keeping the service running and the Tweets flowing Keeping the service running and the Tweets flowing is one of our top priorities in these difficult times. Our work has never been more critical and our service has never been in higher demand. In the past few weeks, we have seen more and more people turn to Twitter to participate in the public conversation and follow what’s happening in real time. The global conversation about COVID-19 and ongoing product improvements are driving up total monetizable DAU (mDAU), with quarter-to-date average total mDAU reaching approximately 164 million, up 23% from 134 million in Q1 2019 and up 8% from 152 million in Q4 2019. We’ve also seen a 45% increase in our curated events page usage and a 30% increase in Direct Message (DM) usage since March 6. While many of our teams are transitioning to working from home, some of our infrastructure teams have physical responsibilities that are critical to keeping our data centers, and Twitter, up and running. These teams are operating under the “essential services” provisions dedicated in City, County, and State orders to ensure business continuity. We couldn’t keep the Tweets flowing without their daily dedication and hard work. The combination of the new work environment and the increased load on our platform has placed unique stresses on our operations, requiring our engineering teams to work more closely together than ever to respond to new demands, and to plan for the future. From our IT, Network, and Product Engineering teams to our Infrastructure and Data Center teams, we have collectively mobilized to ensure we are able to stay safe and productive under the stress of the new levels of traffic we’re seeing on our service. The effects of COVID-19 on Twitter have already surpassed any event we’ve seen, and it’s possible that as the pandemic continues, we will see additional stress on our service. Beyond Twitter, COVID-19 has also had a far-sweeping impact on our supply chain partners. Whereas normally we'd have months of lead time to add hardware capacity for expected growth, in this case, manufacturing delays in China have compromised the supply chain, resulting in delays in deliveries to our data centers. Our Data Center, SiteOps, Supply Chain, Hardware Engineering, and Mission Critical teams continue to manage the physical infrastructure that underlies the service — expertly innovating to unlock additional capacity in existing supply. Our teams are actively addressing areas where we need to add capacity to critical services, looking at how we can optimize existing technology to perform better, and planning for how we might adjust to the way people are using Twitter during this time. It’s critical for Twitter to stay up and running through this global crisis. Our teams are focused, and as we make changes to our systems to meet these new demands, we will communicate openly. We will share what we’ve done, what we’ve learned, and if we see incidents, what we will do to recover as quickly as possible. Follow @TwitterEng to stay up to date. Read the original post. March 16, 2020 How we're working differently, and what it means for you Back to top 6. Keeping our employees and partners safe May 12, 2020 #LoveWhereverYouWork Twitter was one of the first companies to go to a work from home model in the face of COVID-19, but we don’t anticipate being one of the first to return to offices. We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere. The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it’s safe to return. Here’s how we’re thinking about the next few months: Opening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs. With very few exceptions, offices won’t open before September. When we do decide to open offices, it also won’t be a snap back to the way it was before. It will be careful, intentional, office by office and gradual. There will also be no business travel before September, with very few exceptions, and no in-person company events for the rest of 2020. We will assess 2021 events later this year. We’re proud of the early action we took to protect the health of our employees and our communities. That will remain our top priority as we work through the unknowns of the coming months. #LoveWhereverYouWork Mandatory work from home and supporting our employees Our top priority remains the health and safety of our Tweeps, and we also have a responsibility to support our communities, those who are vulnerable, and the healthcare providers who are on the front lines of this pandemic. To continue this push, we are moving beyond our earlier guidance of “strongly encouraging work from home” provided on March 2 and have now informed all employees globally they must work from home. We understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times. And we will continue to do all that we can to support our Tweeps, including: Paying our contractors, vendors and hourly workers For contractors and hourly workers who are not able to perform their responsibilities from home, Twitter will continue to pay their labor costs to cover standard working hours while Twitter’s work-from-home guidance and/or travel restrictions related to their assigned office are in effect. Additional resources to support parents As part of our ongoing global benefits support, Twitter is stepping in to ease additional expenses parents may be experiencing when their normal daycare closes due to COVID-19 by providing reimbursement for the additional daycare expenses incurred. Helping Tweeps set up their at-home offices All employees, including hourly workers, will receive reimbursement toward their home office set up expenses, and we are working with our vendors to ensure our contractors' work-from-home needs are met as well. We listened to employee feedback and expanded our policy to include home office equipment, such as desks, desk chairs, and ergonomic chair cushions. We’re also allowing Tweeps to expense online fees while working from home. #FlockTalk Last year, we introduced #FlockTalk, a program activated when Tweeps want to come together during difficult times to share what’s going on with them, find community, and be heard by our leaders. News around COVID-19 is impacting people in a number of different ways — from schools and offices being closed, to serious health concerns, to racism toward communities, we’re all dealing with a lot. The Twitter Inclusion & Diversity team (@TwitterTogether), in partnership with @TwitterAsians, will host a virtual #FlockTalk that acknowledges there’s a direct correlation between conversations between us, the health of our workplace, and the health of our service. Resource guides to make the work-from-home transition easier Working from home can be a challenging transition, so we’ve provided a variety of resource guides to help our employees continue to get the job done. We’re listing them here as well because at times like this, sharing insights and learning is so important. We’re all in this together and we want to help others outside of Twitter make their transitions to working outside of their offices easier. Working-from-home best practices: We have shared the factors to consider to make sure Tweeps are ready to be productive and healthy. Some factors include workspace, communication, self-care, and logging hours. Overall, working from home doesn’t change your day-to-day work, it just means you’ll be doing it from a different environment. Managing a distributed team: Being a people manager means providing a consistent and positive employee experience for everyone on your team, regardless of location. This manager resource guide highlights the three key pillars of management: strategy, growth and care. So what changes when your team is fully distributed? The good news — not much! These pillars still apply whether you manage a distributed or co-located team. Virtual interview guide: All interviews at Twitter will be done via video conferencing. A completely virtual interview has its benefits. It is ideal for introducing candidates to remote work cultures, and it is a great opportunity for candidates who will work remotely to get a sense for the experience of interacting with other team members remotely. While this virtual interview guide is not a holistic interview guide, it instead focuses on the aspects of interviewing candidates remotely that differ from interviewing candidates in-person. We have also shared guides for working across time zones, using collaboration tools to stay connected, and ergonomic tips for working from home and on-the-go. We’ll continue sharing information as we navigate these changes. It’s all in dedication to keeping our Tweeps and everyone around us healthy. We’re all in this together! Read the original post. March 2, 2020 Encouraging employees to work from home In addition to the travel, event, and visitor restrictions that we previously shared, today we provided additional guidance as we look to protect the health and safety of our workforce. Beginning today, we are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they’re able. Our goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the COVID-19 for us — and the world around us. We are operating out of an abundance of caution and the utmost dedication to keeping our Tweeps healthy. We are working to make sure internal meetings, all hands, and other important tasks are optimized for remote participation. We recognize that working from home is not ideal for some job functions. For those employees who prefer or need to come into the offices, they will remain open for business. Our Real Estate & Workplace team is increasing deep-cleaning and sanitizing in all spaces, as well as more visual reminders for personal hygiene best practices and prepackaged, precomposed, and preplated food options. Working from home will be mandatory for employees based in our Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea offices due in part to government restrictions. Our criteria will evolve over time as we get more information, and we will communicate to affected Tweeps as appropriate. While this is a big change for us, we have already been moving toward a more distributed workforce that’s increasingly remote. We're a global service and we’re committed to enabling anyone, anywhere, to work at Twitter. Read the original post. March 1, 2020 Suspending noncritical business travel and events We recently shared information about the work we’re doing to surface the right information to promote constructive engagement and to highlight credible information around the spread of #coronavirus COVID-19. We will continue to update the public on these efforts this week. We also have the responsibility of ensuring that the health and safety of our employees and partners is not compromised. We have continued to monitor the situation closely and are adjusting our internal policies to respond to this rapidly evolving situation. On February 29, we informed our people and started notifying partners that we are suspending all noncritical business travel and events. This policy is effective immediately and will continue until the World Health Organization or Centers for Disease Control deem it appropriate to step back from pandemic precautionary measures or when a vaccine becomes available. Our goal is to reduce the risk that anyone at Twitter might contract or inadvertently spread the virus. It is important that we take these proactive steps to protect ourselves and others and minimize the spread of COVID-19. There are enormous transnational efforts underway to tackle this virus. As a global company with a global workforce, we want to do what we can to help the success of these multistakeholder containment efforts. Temporarily suspending travel is an immediate and important step. We want to thank our people, partners, and customers for their patience and understanding. Read the original post. Back to top 7. Sharing Twitter’s metrics *After further examining our data, we have made updates to our proactive enforcement metrics published on January 12, 2021 which were previously misinterpreted. The updated metrics are now reflected in the posts below. January 12, 2021 Updated proactive enforcement metrics Since introducing our COVID-19 guidance, we have removed 8,493 Tweets and challenged 11.5 million accounts. We continue to prioritize removing or annotating potentially harmful and misleading information, to ensure that users receive credible information rather than misinformation. Oct 22, 2020 Updated proactive enforcement metrics Since introducing our COVID-19 guidance we have removed 6,466 Tweets and challenged 8 million accounts. July, 14, 2020 An update to our proactive enforcement and metrics on credible information Since introducing our COVID-19 guidance we have removed 4,647 Tweets and challenged 4.5 million accounts. It is important to note our approach is not only about removing or annotating potentially harmful and misleading information, but also elevating credible information. To date, over 160 million people have visited the COVID-19 curated page, over two billion times. May 4, 2020 An update on our proactive enforcement and spam detection Since introducing our updated policies on March 18, we have removed more than 4,074 Tweets containing misleading and potentially harmful content from Twitter. Additionally, our automated systems have challenged more than 3.4 million accounts which were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviors. We will continue to use both technology and our teams to help us identify and stop spammy behavior and accounts. April 1, 2020 Our platform usage In the past few weeks, we have seen more and more people turn to Twitter to participate in the public conversation and follow what’s happening in real time.

It’s important to be transparent about all of this work as the US Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2021, approaches. Updated our coordinated harmful activity policy We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm. Given the violent events in Washington, DC, and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon. Many of the individuals impacted by this updated enforcement action held multiple accounts, driving up the total number of accounts impacted. Since Friday, more than 70,000 accounts have been suspended as a result of our efforts, with many instances of a single individual operating numerous accounts. These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service. Our updated enforcement on QAnon content on Twitter, along with routine spam challenges, has resulted in changes in follower count for some people’s Twitter accounts. In some cases, these actions may have resulted in follower count changes in the thousands. As stipulated in this policy that we announced ahead of the 2020 US election, accounts that have Tweeted or Retweeted associated content will continue to be subject to limited visibility across search, replies, and on timelines and are prohibited from being recommended to others by Twitter. It’s important that these types of accounts — that are not predominantly engaged in sharing this material — can see different perspectives in the open public conversation that Twitter uniquely provides. Our teams are discussing ways we can empower research into QAnon and coordinated harmful activity on Twitter. Escalated enforcement measures for our Civic Integrity Policy During the past several weeks, misleading and false information surrounding the 2020 US presidential election has been the basis for incitement to violence around the country. We took action on these claims in line with our Civic Integrity Policy. Now that the results of the election have been officially certified by Congress, we updated our Civic Integrity policy on Friday to aggressively increase our enforcement action on these claims. The updated policy provides details about how we enforce against violations of this policy, including repeated sharing of Tweets that receive warning labels. Ultimately, repeated violations of this policy can result in permanent suspension. Deployed tech to surface potentially harmful Tweets for urgent human review Our teams are continuing to aggressively deploy technology to surface potentially harmful Tweets for human review in an effort to take action as quickly as possible on violative content. Using this combination of technology and human review helps our teams work at scale during this critical time. We continue to update these tools as terminology and behaviors evolve on Twitter. Limited engagement on labeled Tweets On Tuesday, we limited engagement by no longer allowing any Tweets labeled for violations of our civic integrity policy to be replied to, Liked or Retweeted. People on Twitter are still able to Quote Tweet to share this content with additional context or their own perspective. Blocked violative keywords from Search and Trends We want Trends to promote healthy conversations on Twitter. This means, at times, we may prevent certain content from trending. There are rules for Trends, and if we identify Trends that violate these rules, we’ll take enforcement action. Since last week, we've prohibited certain terms from surfacing in Trends and Search based on the following Twitter Rules: Coordinated harmful activity Civic integrity Hateful conduct Glorification of violence Violent threats Sensitive media We will also continue to prioritize reviewing and adding context to Trends. Our goal is to help people see what’s happening while ensuring that potentially confusing trends are presented with context. Fought spam and challenged potentially inauthentic accounts It is against the Twitter Rules to engage in spamming behavior, including bulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity. That’s why we routinely deploy anti-spam challenges to accounts to fight this behavior and protect the public conversation. During these challenges, account owners must verify their authenticity through a variety of measures, such as reCAPTCHA or providing a functional email address. As always, while accounts are undergoing these challenges, they’re temporarily removed from follower counts. This, along with our updated enforcement around coordinated harmful activity, means some people may notice drops or fluctuations in their follower count. Ahead of the inauguration, we’ll continue to monitor the situation, keep open lines of communication with law enforcement, and keep the public informed of additional enforcement actions."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/account-labels-phase2","date":"2021-01-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Expanding our work to identify state-affiliated accounts","text":"Twitter is where people come to see what’s happening and to hear from their governments and government officials. We believe that safety and free expression go hand-in-hand, especially when interacting with these leaders and associated institutions, and adding context to what people see on Twitter helps them have a more informed experience on Twitter. In August 2020, we expanded account labels to two additional categories: 1) the accounts of key government officials and 2) accounts belonging to state-affiliated media entities. Included in this initial action were accounts from countries represented in the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. After receiving feedback on this initial action from a range of stakeholders — including civil society, academia, and those who use our service — on Wednesday, February 17, we will expand these labels to accounts from Group of Seven (G7) countries, and to a majority of countries that Twitter has attributed state-linked information operations to. We’ll also apply labels to the personal accounts of heads of state for these countries. Here is the full phased plan: Phase 1 Countries (August 2020) China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, and United States Phase 2 Countries (February 17, 2021) Canada, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates We will add labels to the following categories of Twitter accounts: Verified accounts of key government officials, including foreign ministers, institutional entities, ambassadors, official spokespeople, and key diplomatic leaders. At this time, our focus is on senior officials and entities who are the official voice of the state abroad; Personal accounts of heads of state, from phase 1 and phase 2 countries. We’re also updating the label text to add more specificity to the government account labels by differentiating between individuals and institutions, and expanding labels to the personal accounts of heads of state to give people on Twitter additional context. As the next phase of this project, we will work to apply additional labels on state-affiliated media accounts over the next several months, taking an iterative approach to ensure we capture all relevant accounts. Our principled approach Our mission is to serve the public conversation and an important part of that work is providing people with context so they can make informed decisions about what they see and how they engage on Twitter. Twitter provides an unmatched way to connect with and directly speak to public officials and representatives. How do we define government accounts for these new labels? Our focus is on senior officials, heads of state, and institutions that are the voice of the nation state abroad, specifically the account categories listed above. We believe this is an important step so that when people see an account discussing geopolitical issues from another country, they have context on its national affiliation, and are better informed about who they represent. We’re also focused on those within the respective administrations underneath the head of state that offer its policy perspective abroad. To offer even more context to the public, clicking on a label directs people to this article explaining the policy and referring them to the Twitter Transparency Report for additional information. Notification and appeals process Twitter notifies accounts when they receive a label, and account owners can communicate with Twitter directly if they have feedback. Next steps The immediate next phase will be to apply these labels to state-affiliated media entities of these phase two countries. Beyond this, we will continue expanding labels to additional countries over time and look forward to providing additional updates as those plans take shape."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/ttr-17","date":"2021-01-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Transparency","Company"],"title":"Insights from the 17th Twitter Transparency Report","text":"Meaningful transparency between companies, regulators, civil society, and the general public is fundamental to the work we do at Twitter — this transparency is a key tenet of our efforts to preserve and protect the Open Internet. In line with this philosophy, in August we launched our new Twitter Transparency Center to make our data easier to understand and analyze for those who access our biannual Twitter Transparency Report. Our latest Twitter Transparency Report includes data from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted business operations for all of us around the world. Given the changes in workflows, coupled with country specific COVID-19 restrictions, there was some significant and unpredictable disruption to our content moderation work and the way in which teams assess content and enforce our policies - a disruption that is reflected in some of the data presented today. We increased our use of machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially abusive and misleading content, whilst continually focusing human review in areas where the likelihood of harm was the greatest. In March, we launched a COVID-19 misleading information policy to further protect the health of the public conversation. During this reporting period, our teams took enforcement action against 4,658 accounts for violations of this policy. As we’ve further invested in technology, our automated systems challenged 4.5 million accounts that were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviors. Our work on information operations Twitter discloses state-backed actors’ attempts to disrupt the conversation on the service. During this reporting period, we took action on more than 52,000 accounts that we reliably attributed to information operations originating within China, Russia, Turkey, Serbia, Honduras, Egypt, Indonesia, Ghana and Nigeria as well as a KSA-affiliated actor. Platform manipulation We continued our zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to undermine the integrity of our service. During this latest reporting period, our teams saw a 54% increase in anti-spam challenges — an increase that is due in part to the proactive measures we put in place to protect the conversation around COVID-19. We also saw a 16% increase in the number of spam reports, compared to the last reporting period. Terrorism & violent extremism There was a 5% increase in the number of accounts removed for violations of our terrorism and violent extremism policies during this reporting period — 94% of those accounts were proactively identified. Our current methods of surfacing potentially violating content for human review include leveraging the shared industry hash database supported by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). Child sexual exploitation We do not tolerate child sexual exploitation (CSE) on Twitter. CSE material is removed from the service without further notice and reported to The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). As we have expanded our teams and increased operational capacity in this area, we saw a 68% increase in our enforcement under our Child Sexual Exploitation Policy. Copyright and trademark Under our Copyright Policy, we received 15% more Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices affecting 87% more accounts during this reporting period. Under our Trademark Policy, our trademark notice compliance decreased by 30% during this time. Twitter Rules enforcement Abuse/harassment Targeted harassment of someone, or inciting other people to do so, is against the Twitter Rules. There was a 34% decrease in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our abuse policy. Civic integrity We saw a steady increase in the number of accounts actioned under our Civic Integrity Policy, as elections happened around the world during this reporting period. There was a 37% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of this policy during this reporting period. Hateful conduct Over the six month reporting period and amidst the COVID-19 disruptions to workflow, we saw a 35% decrease in the number of accounts actioned under our Hateful Conduct Policy. In March 2020, our Hateful Conduct Policy expanded to cover new facets of our dehumanization guidance, specifically prohibiting language that dehumanizes people on the basis of age, disability, and disease. Promoting suicide & self-harm We do not permit people to promote, advocate, and persuade another individual to engage in self-harm or suicide. There was a 49% decrease in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our suicide or self-harm policy. Private information We have clear rules around the sharing of private information on our service. During this reporting period, we continued to see an upward trend in our enforcement under this policy — up by 68%. This increase was due to our proactive efforts in this area. Non-consensual nudity Enforcement numbers for non-consensual nudity (NCN) on the service experienced a 58% decrease. We'll continue working to improve processes and models to be as proactive as possible in maintaining a healthy environment for the people on Twitter. Information requests (legal requests for account information): Twitter received 12,657 legal requests for account information specifying 25,560 accounts during this period, from 68 different countries. Removal requests (legal requests for content removal)*: Twitter received 42,220 legal demands to remove content specifying 85,375 accounts during this period, from 53 different countries. 96% of the total global volume of requests originated from five countries: Japan, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, and India. These requests impacted approximately 13% fewer accounts compared to the previous reporting period. We received 19% more reports based on local law(s) from trusted reporters and non-governmental organizations, impacting approximately 7% more accounts, compared to the previous reporting period. What’s next? As noted throughout the report, the COVID-19 pandemic did significantly disrupt our content moderation work during this time - a disruption that is reflected in much of the data presented today. Our enforcement teams have adjusted their approach in the context of a pandemic and are continuing to increase their capacity to get back to the strong pre-COVID levels of enforcement that is expected. There will always be more work to do in this space, and we’ll continue to provide biannual Twitter Transparency Reports that offer more clarity into our operations and work to protect the public conversation. We also recognize the importance of measuring prevalence of certain content on Twitter, and we have begun a multi-year initiative to enable us to provide more consistent transparency on these issues. We look forward to sharing more details in due course. Follow @Policy and @TwitterSafety for updates on our policies and our work on transparency throughout the year. *Unless prohibited from doing so, we continue to publish these legal requests when we take action directly to the Lumen Database, a partnership with Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2021/over-2-billion-gaming-tweets-in-2020-","date":"2021-01-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data","Insights"],"title":"Over 2 Billion Gaming Tweets in 2020!","text":"2020 was the year we were all at home.

Launching a new Data Governance Committee To strengthen the implementation of our privacy and security policies and standards, we’re establishing an internal Data Governance Committee (DGC). This committee will ensure we are making consistent and balanced decisions around how we use and protect your data. The Committee will oversee all decisions to collect, maintain, use, disclose, or provide access to customer data internally.

Infusing security and privacy into everything we build Keeping your data secure and respecting your privacy will always be ongoing work for us. In collaboration with teams across Twitter and external partners, some of our most recent efforts include: Expanding the privacy and security reviews conducted before a product or service can be launched to include a mandatory assessment of our Software Development lifecycle; Revamping our proactive internal audits of systems and services to ensure that they happen more frequently; Expanding our privacy and security teams; and Providing annual reports from our CISO and CPO to our full Board of Directors to drive awareness, alignment and accountability on privacy and security. This work builds on our efforts to improve the security of our internal tools and systems which includes strengthening our access management processes and authentication systems for support tools, improving our detection and monitoring capabilities, and investing in additional penetration testing and scenario planning to help secure Twitter from a range of possible threats. It also goes hand in hand with our ongoing work to tackle technical debt and build security and privacy into everything we launch. We believe that, ultimately, this work and these changes will keep the data you trust us with secure and private.

And Twitter is the place where people go to talk about their passions and interests, especially when it comes to good eats. We teamed up with Brandwatch, a pioneering digital consumer intelligence company, to uncover top consumer trends around food alternatives by looking at share of voice. To do this, Brandwatch observed a random smaller sample (33%) of the overall conversation on Twitter from 2019 to 2020. Read on for the top consumer trends they’re picking up around food alternatives. As veganism and vegetarianism continue to dominate online conversations, two trends within these categories have surfaced: eating for awareness and eating for a higher purpose. These purpose-driven trends are priming consumers to look for ways they can take responsibility for the impact of their food choices. Eating for awareness is seen in popular trends like Veganuary, which encouraged people to commit to veganism for the month of January. And considering everyone loves a good challenge, Veganuary commanded attention. Eating for a higher purpose cropped up throughout popular discussions on Twitter, as users challenged each other to think beyond the individual by choosing a vegan diet to help reduce our carbon footprint. Alternative options for milk are extremely popular and include a wide range of choices for consumers. But what about them is driving interest? To a large extent, the discussions around dairy alternatives have a lot to do with sustainability – but not in the way you might expect. In fact, conversations have surfaced environmental concerns within the alternatives themselves, revealing both interest and debate. In that context, one milk alternative has pulled away from the pack. Oat milk saw the largest growth in online discussions (an increase of 66% YoY). Meanwhile, other milk alternatives have maintained some relevance, gaining traction in commentary around hugely popular recipes like overnight oats. When it comes to choices around meat substitutions, trends like #MeatlessMondays are leaving plenty on the bone. Consumers can now enjoy a variety of meat alternatives while enjoying favorite snacks like jerky, crisps, and more. In fact, popular meat-free ingredients like tofu, jackfruit, seitan, tempeh, and pea protein have even made their way into beloved desserts like brownies. Pea protein in particular has seen a 42% increase YoY in its share of voice. And as meatless meal options are proliferating, they’re also speeding up—which is to say that fast food outlets are talking up their own branded meat alternatives, offering new vegan and vegetarian options to mainstream markets. Superfoods are healthy ingredients packed with vitamins, minerals, and plenty to talk about on Twitter. Everyone already loves avocados, a superfood powerhouse, which is now almost an essential ingredient to premium salads, tacos, and (of course) toast. Blueberries were often included in conversations surrounding cakes, oatmeals, and pancakes. Meanwhile, ginger, kale, chia, matcha, and acai berries were mentioned around juicing. In short, superfoods have shown supergrowth. Take flax, for example, whose share of voice has seen an increase of 991% year over year! Other options like matcha have grown by 74% compared to last year. No food discussion would be complete without a bag of chips, and chips are seeing a rise in popularity too. Vegetable and legume-based crisps like lentils, kale, and sweet potato have some major buzz. Air fryers are currently in the spotlight, which are becoming known for their ability to make delicious kale chips. Their overall share of voice went up 24% year over year. The benefits of rice crackers have become a popular topic too, with a share of voice that went up 19% year over year. Food brings people together and so does Twitter. Like a good meal, it’s a space for passion, where people get to the heart of what matters.

Countries are pulling at the threads of the DSM – such as the Country of Origin Principle – without fully appreciating the damage they might cause to Europe’s digital ecosystem. Small-to-medium size tech companies, including homegrown enterprises, are asking the EU to preserve the regulatory frameworks that underpin their existence. Automattic, Jodel, Seznam, Twitter and Vimeo are today building on their joint advocacy over the past year (letter, June 2021) with a DSA Holiday Wish List. We seek to encourage fair and progressive regulation, both in Europe and globally, that works for companies and countries of all sizes. Here’s our 2022 wish list for the DSA: A harmonised definition and enforcement framework across Member States for ‘illegal content’. This avoids excessive takedowns or conflicting rules that will build digital borders. A strong Country of Origin principle that supports a diverse online marketplace. Without it, we risk entrenching the largest players, reducing consumer choice and irreparably splintering the Digital Single Market. At least ten Member States have submitted positions that align with our view – highlighting the shared interests between smaller companies and smaller countries. No general monitoring obligations or stay-down provisions. If you really mean it, don't include it. A clear and harmonised notice and action mechanism in Article 14. This removes legal uncertainty, duplication, conflict and demonstrates a commitment to a coherent content regime for the EU. No more removal timelines. With conflicting definitions of illegal content, this approach does not do justice to the complexity and context of user expression and would incentivise a “delete first” approach. Remove law enforcement back doors in Article 15a. Ensure transparent and rigorous judicial processes are firmly established with respect to content takedown and user data requests from law enforcement. Gatekeepers / Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) Criteria Alignment. The criteria for defining “Gatekeepers” and VLOPs should be aligned across the Digital Markets Act Article 3 and the DSA’s Article 25. These criteria should reflect the commercial reality of the sector, as shown here. Recognise that search engines are often different to social or commercial platforms. The obligations put on search engines, particularly those not in the VLOP category of services, should be carefully considered and must be feasible and scalable. European search start-ups, such as Seznam, could easily be hurt.

Turns out we did—from reconnecting with people and places that we hadn’t seen in months, to providing a space to champion human rights concerns in all forms and rediscovering the familiar while still adjusting to a new reality, we all made sure foolishness became a thing of the past, and we have endless Tweets to prove it. You really had to be there, but fortunately we made sure to capture the magic that lived #OnlyOnTwitter in 2021. Read on as we revisit some of the top global moments of the year. Note: We only feature one Tweet per account and we don’t consider Tweets that offer reward in exchange for followers or engagement. A new year means a new beginning, and the top Liked Tweet of the year reflects just that as Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States in January. The fourth and fifth top Liked Tweets, from Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, respectively, took a similar tone celebrating a new era. The second place Tweet features a selfie from BTS' JungKook with a simple kissing face emoji caption. Sadly the emoji didn’t make it to our list of most Tweeted emojis (more on that later). Rounding out the top three, our colleagues behind @Twitter captured the collective feeling of the world with a simple three-word Tweet as literally everyone flocked to Twitter on that fateful day in October, proving that less is sometimes more when Tweeting. The most Retweeted Tweet of 2021 takes a more serious tone and brings us back to the social movements that dominated the conversation and brought people across the globe together in support of a mutual cause. During a period in which we saw a rise in hate crimes against Asians, BTS put their influence and massive following to good use, sharing a powerful message in an effort to #StopAsianHate. BTS' fans also used Twitter to celebrate their Billboard Hot 100 hit \"Butter\" and their “Dynamite” #GRAMMYs performance, and ARMY didn’t stop there—#BTS was also the top hashtag of 2021. In 2021, competition was bigger than ever—and we’re not just talking about sports. The most Tweeted TV shows included reality TV competition favorites Big Brother Brasil and A Fazenda 13, while K-drama Squid Game changed how we’ll view children’s games forever, taking the third spot for most discussed TV show worldwide. Escapism was another big theme from TV this year, creating a movement which manifested through meme creations, costume wearing, and more. 2021 was also about bringing back some of the familiar and that includes movies. Can you spot the recurring theme? Superheroes dominated the most discussed movies worldwide. As the home to Hollywood, it’s also no surprise #thesuicidesquad was in the top five most Tweeted hashtags in Los Angeles too. For people on Twitter, the support for their teams is so loud that it spans across continents. Manchester United moved up a spot from 2020 to be the most discussed sports team worldwide, while the team’s Tweet welcoming Cristiano Ronaldo home was the second most Retweeted Tweet worldwide. This year, everyone was thrilled to welcome back large-scale sporting events and the Olympics took the top honor as the most discussed sports match/event worldwide. Around the globe, we saw a strong sense of national pride and unity as people proudly supported their country’s teams. In Indonesia, the most Retweeted Tweet celebrated Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu becoming the first women's doubles pair from Indonesia to win gold at the Olympics. Last but not least, and proving once again that this year was about connection whether that was through tears of sadness or joy, the crying face and the face with tears of joy emoji took the first and second spot, respectively, as the most Tweeted emoji. The eyes emoji also entered the top ten for the first time, growing 7% since last year.

This is just the beginning for Ad-free Articles with much more ad-free content to come as we continue to build more partnerships, with more publishers, in more markets. Support a thriving free press. In continuing our commitment to strengthen and support publishers and a free press, a portion of the revenue from Twitter Blue subscription fees goes directly to publishers within our network. Our goal is to help each publishing partner make 50% more per person than they would’ve made from serving ads to that person. A better experience for readers - and more support for the journalism they care about. Don’t miss a beat with Top Articles1 Designed with Nuzzel lovers in mind, subscribers can easily view the most-shared articles in their network over the last 24 hours, so they can immediately see what’s important in their community. This gives subscribers a new and complementary way of catching up on the latest on Twitter. Customize your Twitter Subscribers can add more flair to their Twitter experience with exclusive app icons and colorful themes2 and Bookmark Folders. We are also introducing Custom Navigation3, which gives subscribers the ability to customize what appears in their navigation bar for quick access to the Twitter destinations they care about most. Tweet smarter, read better With Undo Tweet, subscribers can preview and perfect Tweets before they are sent. Subscribers also have access to Reader, which turns long threads into an easier-to-read experience. They can also change the text size within Reader to tailor their experience even further. Twitter Blue Labs: Get early access to new features Finally, subscribers get early access to features we’re testing — before anyone else! These features might eventually become available to the rest of Twitter, graduate to a feature of Twitter Blue, or sunset based on feedback we hear from subscribers. They will change often, but for now, subscribers will be able to upload videos of up to 10-minutes (as opposed to the standard ~2 minutes for non-subscribers) via Longer Video Uploads4 and pin their favorite conversations to the top of their DM’s with Pinned Conversations.5 Adapting as we go - with your feedback in mind From our initial launch, we learned that existing subscribers loved many of the features we brought to market, including the ability to customize and tailor their experience on Twitter to meet their needs and personalities, and of course, to review their Tweets before they go out in the wild. We also learned they want even more customization, exclusive first-looks, and the ability to make their Twitter experience more functional. And we’re building towards exactly that. With Twitter Blue, we are not only bringing the most active people on Twitter more of what they want, but we’re also supporting local, national, and ad-free journalism in a more direct way. It’s early days for Twitter Blue and we’re looking forward to listening, learning, and building out even more features and tools over the coming months. As we look ahead, you can anticipate more features in Labs, more customization opportunities on different types of surfaces, and perhaps a few surprises along the way!

And now, that’s changing. Starting today, we’re testing Communities, a way to easily find and connect with people who want to talk about the same things you do. Tweet to your Community Some conversations aren’t for everyone, just the people who want to talk about the thing you want to talk about. When you join a Community, you can Tweet directly to that group instead of to all your followers. Only members in the same Community are able to reply and join the conversation so it stays intimate and relevant. While you can Tweet only to your Community for a focused conversation, Community pages and timelines are publicly available so anyone can read, Quote Tweet, and report Community Tweets. We want to continue to support public conversation and help people find Communities that match their interests, while also creating a more intimate space for conversation. Creating, moderating, and finding Communities With Communities, moderators pick the focus, create the Community rules, and invite the people who will make it a great place for conversation. Think of Communities as places created for conversation where the vibe and tone is set by people who share the same interests and want to have relevant conversations. Moderators set the Community rules and can also invite others to moderate their space to keep things on track and focused. Right now, Community creation is limited but in the coming months, we’ll allow more people to create Communities so everyone can talk about their thing, whatever it is. Some of the initial Communities we’re testing surround popular conversations on Twitter. Examples include dogs, weather, sneakers, skincare, and astrology, with many more to come, reflecting more of the thriving and niche discussions on Twitter. You can let us know if you're interested in creating a Community here. Right now, you have to be invited to a Community by a moderator or another member, but we'll be adding more ways to discover and join Communities soon. Supporting healthy conversations in Communities Here’s what we’re doing to make Communities feel healthy initially, with more to come: Communities are publicly visible so everyone can see what's being discussed. All Communities and their members must follow the Twitter Rules. Both members and non-members of Communities can report any potential violations of the Twitter Rules to Twitter. All moderators have to continuously meet our eligibility requirements, including not violating the Twitter Rules. As we open up Community creation and moderation to more people, we’ll continue to refine eligibility requirements. As we test initially, Community moderators are approved by Twitter. Adapting our Twitter Rules and enforcement actions to keep people safe with Communities. This includes developing ways to proactively identify potentially problematic Communities, new reporting flows, and bespoke enforcement actions. We’ll continue to do research, scenario plan, and work with outside experts including our Trust and Safety Council to keep people safe with Communities. This is just the start for Communities – we’ll test, learn, and iterate based on your feedback. Members can access Communities through the dedicated tab at the bottom of the app for iOS, or in the sidebar on Twitter.com. People can read Community Tweets on Twitter for Android too with more functionality coming soon. Anyone globally can be invited to join a Community via Direct Messages. Learn more about how Communities work here."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/events/2020/behind-the-tweets-at--tokyo2020","date":"2021-01-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Sports","Events"],"title":"Behind the Tweets at #Tokyo2020","text":"The Games are now complete and the last 17 days have left sports fans worldwide with incredible memories from top events, led by some of the finest athletes on the planet.

In December 2020, we shared a few priority areas for us in 2021 - including continuing to partner with industry leaders and developing innovative solutions for our customers to feel confident in being a part of the conversation on Twitter. Since then, we’ve been hard at work building out third-party brand safety measurement solutions in partnership with DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science, and continue on our path towards MRC accreditation. In parallel, we have also been focused on attaining another global brand safety accreditation, and on providing advertisers with more control over the conversations they start on Twitter. We are excited to share two updates on this front: Twitter receives global Brand Safety certification through TAG We’re excited to share that Twitter has successfully earned the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) Brand Safety Certified Seal, which covers Twitter’s global operations*. TAG is a leading global certification program fighting criminal activity and increasing trust in the digital advertising industry. TAG advances its mission of eliminating fraudulent traffic, facilitating the sharing of threat intelligence and promoting brand safety by connecting industry leaders, analyzing threats and sharing best practices worldwide. The TAG Brand Safety Certified program sets global brand safety standards that apply to digital advertising agreements, monetized content takedown practices, the use of inclusion/exclusion lists, and the documentation of specific policies and procedures used to minimize the risk of ad misplacement. These standards impact direct buyers, direct sellers and intermediaries. This certification affords advertisers and agencies the assurance that Twitter has been independently audited to ensure compliance with TAG’s guidelines. Our partnership with TAG supplements our ongoing work with the MRC, and further reinforces our commitment to independent brand safety accreditation. Learn more about program requirements here. Twitter earned its first brand safety accreditation in 2019, when Twitter UK became certified through JICWEBS’ DTSG Good Practice Principles. Last September, JICWEBS merged with TAG in order to create a global certification for brand safety, and we’ve been actively working with TAG over the past several months to extend Twitter’s TAG Brand Safety Certification to cover our global operations. We’re proud to have been among the first companies to attain TAG’s Brand Safety Certification, and we’re proud to expand that certification globally today. In our global ad supply chain, threats to brand safety can extend across oceans and borders. By achieving the TAG Brand Safety Certified Seal for its global operations. Twitter is helping lead the industry in tackling those complicated global challenges. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Twitter to raise the bar on brand safety across our industry. Mike Zaneis CEO of TAG Introducing Conversation Settings for advertisers Twitter is what’s happening and it’s the best place to have conversations with the people that matter most to brands, but we know that sometimes advertisers may need more control over the conversations they have with their customers. That is why we have made it easier for brands to curate their conversations with the introduction of conversation settings for ads. In August 2020, we made new conversation settings available to everyone on Twitter, allowing people to have more control over the conversations they start. Now, we are making these capabilities available to all advertisers when they compose Tweets directly through Tweet Composer or through our Ads API. This update will extend the ability to apply conversation settings to Promoted-only Tweets and to those that use our most popular ad formats, in addition to organic Tweets. You can learn more about how this works here. We are committed to continuing the work on our ongoing brand safety efforts, and will continue to lead with policy, protect with product, and drive industry-wide change through partnerships. We look forward to sharing more updates as we move along. *Twitter’s policies and procedures for minimizing ad misplacement were independently audited and deemed compliant with the TAG Certified for Brand Safety Guidelines Version 1.0. Twitter was validated as a Direct Seller and Intermediary (Consumer Facing Platform), and these procedures were validated globally. The audit did not include processes for Twitter Audience Platform or MoPub, which were excluded from the audit."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/saferinternetday2021togetherforabetterinternet","date":"2021-01-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Health","Partnerships","Policy","Safety","Security","Company"],"title":"#SaferInternetDay 2021: Together for a better Internet","text":"Just as Safer Internet Day has grown from being a European event in 2004 to being celebrated globally 17 years later, Twitter has also grown and has continued to make the safety of those on the service a priority, with each year that passes. Today we join safety partners from over 140 countries to mark #SaferInternetDay2021 and play our part in creating a safer internet for all. To celebrate the global conversation around Internet safety, we launched a special emoji that’s activated by using the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2021. The emoji helps to unify and strengthen the conversation on Twitter, around Safer Internet Day. The theme for Safer Internet Day 2021 (@safeinternetday), ‘Together for a better Internet’ – speaks to a set of beliefs we share as an online service: that the Internet can always be better, that it remains a force for good, and that it’s all of our jobs to make it safe and healthy. We all contribute, we all have our part to play. The safety of Twitter and the health of the public conversation is one of our highest priorities. In the last year, we have made strides in tackling abusive content on our service globally and have seen a 105% increase in accounts actioned by Twitter (locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules). There will always be more to do, but we have made meaningful progress. COVID-19: Staying safe and informed on Twitter As the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, people turned to Twitter to discuss what was happening and find the latest authoritative public health information. In March 2020, we launched a COVID-19 misleading information policy to protect the health of the public conversation.Since then, our teams have removed 8,493 Tweets and our automated systems have challenged 11.5 million accounts which were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviors. In order to bring awareness to gender-based violence as cases surged during the so-called “shadow pandemic”, Twitter has supported nonprofit partners globally by providing Ads for Good grants. In September 2020, around World Suicide Prevention Day, we worked with the International Association for Suicide Prevention to amplify #SuicidePrevention resources with over 20 NGOs globally. In December 2020, we expanded the COVID-19 misleading information policy to address Tweets that contain potentially harmful misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines. #ThereIsHelp Twitter partners with authorities and nonprofit organizations around the world on our #ThereIsHelp notification service. This service provides resources to vulnerable people and encourages them to reach out and get support when people search certain terms on Twitter. This year we expanded the prompts to several new markets in consultation with global and local partners to ensure that we are sharing the latest and most helpful resources in our #ThereisHelp prompts across the globe. We expanded this service to provide information on gender-based violence in 24 markets and on suicide or self harm in 30 markets. Expaning our policies Throughout 2020, we updated our rules against Hateful Conduct, to prohibit language that dehumanizes people on the basis of age, disability, disease, race, ethnicity, national origin as well as to include abusive language promoting “conversion therapy” targeting individuals or the entire LGBTQ+ community. We expanded our policies to further protect the civic conversation: Twitter’s goal is to further protect against content that could suppress the vote and help stop the spread of harmful misinformation that could compromise the integrity of an election or other civic process. The work we do in order to make Twitter safer, must be done in collaboration with our safety partners around the world - that’s why taking part in #SaferInternetDay2021 is key for us. Across the world today and throughout February, we will work with and support our network of safety partners to amplify their guidance, provide Ads for Good grants to elevate their voices and support their campaigns, and collaborate together on helping shape a better Internet. Across 4 continents, we will run safety training, deliver presentations and participate in events to commemorate the day. In Europe, we will be participating in the Safer Internet Day event organised by the European Commission with Better Internet for Kids Youth Ambassadors, and on February 24th we’ll be running a Youth Summit event to promote a safer internet for all citizens, especially young people, as well as to to empower young people to talk about topics that matter to them. Also in Europe, we have partnered with Maldita.es, an independent and non-profit organization focused on fact-checking techniques, on a week-long course on Twitter, specifically designed to educate young people on becoming critical thinkers and identifying misinformation. The course will be available in English through @maldita_es and will be localized in Spain through their @MalditaEduca. It will also be localized in Germany through @correctiv_org within the next weeks. We provided Ads for good for all partners. In the UK, Safer Internet Day 2021 will be celebrated with the theme, “An Internet we trust: exploring reliability in the online world”. The Internet has an amazing range of information and opportunities online. This year, in the UK, Safer Internet Day aims to explore how we can separate fact from fiction when online. We have provided Ads for Good to the UK Safer Internet Centre, which is made up of organisations including Childnet International, Internet Watch Foundation and South West Grid for Learning, in order to help support their work toward a better internet for all. In Spain, we have partnered with and provided Ads For Good to PantallasAmigas on the joint campaign with Fundación Mapfre to educate young people on Internet Safety. We will also be participating in the Safer Internet Day event organized by INCIBE, specifically in the session “Favoring safe and positive digital experiences”. In MENA, we’ll be running an online safety workshop with the UAE TRA Virtual Academy. This partnership is an opportunity to educate the audience on multiple elements of online and Internet safety, ranging from digital footprint controls to media information literacy and security best practices. We also aim to create an open dialogue to discuss the Twitter Rules and provide feedback on our global efforts to create a safer Internet for everyone. In the United States, we’ve issued #AdsForGood grants to partners across the country to help people thrive in a digital world. Through these investments, we will amplify conversations to educate families, schools, and young people to support their online safety, privacy, and security. In Spanish Speaking LatAm, @TwitterLatam will hold a virtual Twitter for Nonprofits workshop focused on Safety and Security. In this training we will discuss the Twitter Rules and enforcement, reporting channels, tools that people have to control their experience on Twitter, and account security best practices. In Thailand, we will host a virtual panel discussion on Twitter to raise awareness on internet safety and promote media literacy with our NGO partners @HugProjectTH, @EcpatFoundation, and @saidek1387 (Childline Thailand). We provided #AdsForGood for all partners. The session will be moderated by Hug Project. People can Tweet their questions with hashtag #วันการใช้อินเทอร์เน็ตที่ปลอดภัยขึ้น. In the Philippines, we will host a virtual panel discussion on Twitter together with support on #AdsForGood during #SaferInternetDay to promote safer Internet and better collaboration with @planphilippines, @ECPATPh, @PCWgovph and @unicefphils. The discussion will be moderated by Plan International Philippines and there will be a Q&A session. People can Tweet their questions using hashtag #SID2021. In Singapore, together with the Singapore Media Literacy Council (@MLCSingapore) we will host a conversation on Twitter to discuss the community's role in promoting a safer Internet, and shared digital literacy resources to help keep people safe online. We also conducted a virtual safety workshop for Roses of Peace and its youth ambassadors to talk about safety and security tips for young people. We are encouraging conversations with a special emoji for the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2021, available in eighteen languages to encourage conversations around a safer Internet. Throughout 2021, we will continue to support our safety partners, and work to ensure the public conversation on Twitter stays healthy, open and safe.

Lockdowns imposed around the world have brought significant pain to the sector and most have struggled to make up revenue shortfalls online. And as we look to vaccinations as the path back to normality, it's unclear how many small businesses will survive that long. A recent McKinsey study found that more than half of the 2,200 small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) they surveyed across Europe felt their businesses may not survive longer than 12 months. Meanwhile, in the US, 59% of small businesses surveyed in a Goldman Sachs study reported a negative revenue impact from the pandemic. Considering that SMBs employ just under half of the US workforce1 and two-thirds of Europe's2, you quickly see the importance of this sector to the wider economy. Even before the pandemic, small businesses in numerous industries were struggling to compete against the industry goliaths, who used their scale, technology and access to capital to muscle into new markets and keep upstarts out of theirs. Incumbency has therefore proven a powerful thing: it’s no wonder the rate of new business creation has been in decline for decades and is at its lowest level since the late ‘70s.3 And due to successive waves of mergers, some industries have never been more concentrated. The pandemic could accelerate this consolidation, making it even tougher for small businesses to succeed. Faced with these two existential threats, what can small businesses do to compete in what feels like a David vs. Goliath world? From my perspective, it’s really all about the customer. In a world where it's increasingly difficult to differentiate on product or service features, price or quality, customer experience is one of the main ways you can stand out in the crowd. By focusing on listening to and understanding your customers you can build loyalty while identifying new opportunities to serve them. How? By listening. Your customers, prospective customers, and competitors are sharing their experiences, feedback and ideas openly on social media every day. And due to its open nature, Twitter is a great place to both connect with your customers and learn more about what’s important to them. Just about anything and everything is shared on Twitter, from the trendy to the mundane, often answering questions you didn't think to ask. This hints at an important characteristic of Twitter data: unsolicited opinions and feedback shared by consumers in the moment they are actually having that experience. These perspectives are unfiltered, raw and emotional, shedding light on underlying motivations, emerging behaviors and new norms. Surveys can be helpful, but they are guided by the questions asked and it can be a struggle to get people to complete them. Social listening on the other hand allows you to instantly tap into millions of conversations on topics important to your business. We like to think of it as the world’s largest focus group. It’s never been easier to tap into the public conversation on Twitter to support your business’s growth. Social media management tools such as Sprout Social, a Twitter Official Partner, make it easy to deliver social customer service and listen to customers for ideas on how to improve your products or services while gathering inspiration for new ones. From the florist to the pharmacist and the retailer to the restaurateur, small businesses of all shapes and sizes can gather insights that help move themselves forward. And as we enter 2021 with the hope of recovery on the horizon, investing in market awareness is a truly wise investment, which just might help some of the Davids out there take on their Goliaths.

In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action. Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open. However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement. The below is a comprehensive analysis of our policy enforcement approach in this case. Overview On January 8, 2021, President Donald J. Trump Tweeted: “The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” Shortly thereafter, the President Tweeted: “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks. After assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service. Assessment We assessed the two Tweets referenced above under our Glorification of Violence policy, which aims to prevent the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts and determined that they were highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts that took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. This determination is based on a number of factors, including: President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th. The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol. The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. As such, our determination is that the two Tweets above are likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitters-global-impact-report","date":"2021-01-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Diversity","Insights","Policy","Transparency","Twitter for Good","Company"],"title":"Introducing Twitter’s Global Impact Report","text":"Today, we’re excited to share our first Global Impact Report, a cohesive representation of the work we’ve done across environment, social, and governance issues since Twitter’s founding in 2006. Now more than ever, building trust through transparency and accountability is key to delivering on our purpose of serving the public conversation. Over the years, we’ve been open about our work and where we’re making an impact - from our quarterly I&D Reports that highlight our commitments to inclusion and diversity, to our Transparency Reports which reflect our work to protect the integrity of the conversation on Twitter. This report aims to bring these and other initiatives together in one place, showcasing Twitter’s work across corporate responsibility, sustainability, and philanthropy. It’s a big step in our commitment to sharing more about the work we know is important to the people we serve - from our employees, or Tweeps, to partners, investors and the people around the world who use Twitter. For our 2020 report, we’ve organized our work into five key areas: Our service: Earning trust is one of our core operating principles, and it begins with how we act. We want people to have safe, inclusive and authentic conversations on Twitter, and we’re working to promote healthy conversations on our service while continuing to grow our audience and our business in socially responsible ways. Governance: We’re committed to sound corporate governance, strong ethics and compliance practices, which promote the long-term interests of the diverse communities we serve and help build public trust in Twitter. People and culture: We often say that​ Tweeps come for the purpose and stay for the people, along with the unique experience and knowledge gained from working at Twitter. This includes building a company and culture that reflects the incredibly vibrant and diverse conversations happening on our service every day. Twitter for Good: Strengthening our communities is core to our social impact philosophy. Our goal is to bring our company and community together as a positive societal force around the world. Planet: Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. We’re committed to protecting the environment, reducing our carbon footprint, and fostering long-term sustainability projects to play our part. Our hope is that by presenting and organizing our work in this way, we’ll be able to clearly showcase what we’ve done and provide a roadmap of where we’re headed. Download What’s next We’ve made an impact - both as a company and as a service supporting the public conversation. While our work is not done, we’re confident that our progress and our clarity of purpose position us well to continue making an impact and improving the health of the public conversation. We’ll continue to make progress on these important initiatives and share more about our efforts in the future. In the meantime, we’ll keep listening to your ideas and feedback.

To close out 2020, Twitter partnered with MAMA (Mnet ASIAN MUSIC AWARDS) to bring K-pop fans’ favorite artists closer to them than ever before. The hashtags #2020MAMA and #MAMA2020 topped Twitter real-time trends worldwide and in 68 markets, with a whopping 126 million Tweets related to 2020 MAMA generated from October 29 to December 6. #2020MAMA also marked the first time use of the ‘Twitter Stanbot’, the exclusive high quality, slow motion videos of K-pop artists and K-drama casts, with these videos viewable only on the official @MnetMAMA Twitter account. Other #OnlyOnTwitter content like 1:1 Q&A, Emoji, Fleets, and Voice drove conversations and trending topics about album launches, key artist milestones, and more, to bring fans closer to their favorite K-pop artists. More than music, K-pop idols and fans band together for social causes on Twitter As shown by #YearOnTwitter, the second most-Tweeted hashtag of 2020 was #BlackLivesMatter as the world mobilized and amplified the need for equality and social justice. K-pop fans, as well as their favorite idols, participated in the movement by mobilizing others to use the hashtag and join the cause, as well as raise funds through initiatives like #MatchAMillion.

Ahead of World Environment Day, we’re partnering with organizations committed to tackling climate change and making it easier to find credible climate information from global experts. This week, we took additional steps to better serve the climate conversation happening across Twitter. We know that people use the service to find credible information during global crises. Starting this week, you can follow the Climate Change Topic to find personalized conversations about climate change, including Tweets from environmental and sustainability organizations, environmental activists, and scientists. These Tweets will appear right in your home timeline when you follow the Topic. Addressing the climate emergency requires collaboration, community, and widespread mobilization. Through #AdsForGood grants, events, on-service support, and trainings, we’re partnering with organizations promoting and amplifying environmental conservation and sustainability. These include Earth Day Network, United Nations (UN) Environment Programme, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UN Development Programme, Greenpeace, Voice for the Planet, Let Me Breathe, WWF, 350.org, FridaysForFuture, We Don’t Have Time, Climate Reality Project, and others. We’ve also made new environmental commitments and expanded Twitter’s sustainability efforts. In partnership with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), we’ve committed to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, paving the way for our net-zero journey. We recognize that transparency and accountability should be central to our approach to sustainability. We’re excited about the SBTi pledge because it advances Twitter’s environmental efforts in a clear and measurable way. We’re committed to protecting the environment, reducing our carbon footprint, and using our service to make a positive difference in the world. We continue to work toward our goal of achieving 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. We’ve partnered with Cool Effect, a nonprofit organization that helps offset emissions from our data centers and employee travel, to fund green projects around the world. So far, 92% of our global offices have achieved the \"Green Building Certified\" standard, with more to come. We’re mobilizing our workforce around the globe to participate and to make change at Twitter, but we know there’s more to do. That’s why, we’re ramping up our sustainability goals company-wide. How can you participate? We all have a part we can play in tackling this global crisis. From volunteering with an environmental organization in your community, to learning more about protecting our planet, there are lots of ways to get involved. Promote sustainable causes and ideas, advocate to your elected representatives, and join the conversation. Every little bit matters. We encourage you to Tweet along with the #WorldEnvironmentDay conversation happening on Twitter and follow the Climate Change Topic for more."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/-expanding-access-beyond-information-operations-","date":"2021-01-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Expanding access beyond information operations","text":"Editorial note: This blog was first published on 2 December 2021 and last updated 24 August 2022 to include updates to our approach. In October 2018, we published the first comprehensive, public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Since then, we’ve shared 37 datasets of attributed platform manipulation campaigns originating from 17 countries, spanning more than 200 million Tweets and nine terabytes of media. More than 26,000 researchers have accessed these datasets, empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter. We strive to provide timely updates, alongside comprehensive data, whenever our teams identify and remove these campaigns, however, this year, due to technical issues and significant risks to the physical safety of our employees posed by certain disclosures, we have only provided one update. During this time, we’ve been working to identify a sustainable path forward, without compromising on our goals of providing meaningful transparency. Today, in addition to disclosing eight additional datasets in our archive, we’re sharing an update on what we’ve learned from these efforts and how we intend to advance data-driven transparency in 2022 and beyond. What we’ve learned so far Meaningful transparency begins with access to data. The data we publish about information operations allows researchers to understand not just that a platform manipulation campaign took place and that Twitter removed it — but precisely which narratives that campaign aimed to advance, and how widely they spread on Twitter. Access to raw content, rather than limited samples and aggregate information, is important. Raw data isn’t accessible to everyone. Many of the datasets we’ve released include hundreds of thousands of Tweets and gigabytes of media. Processing this information often requires advanced tooling and capabilities. Academics, independent researchers, NGOs and data journalists play a key part in translating raw data into meaningful insights, as well as providing critical context in understanding how bad actors operate. Partnerships with the Stanford Internet Observatory and Australia Strategic Policy Institute have helped put these datasets in analytic and narrative context, along with a conference dedicated to studying this data we held in conjunction with the Carnegie Institute. Confident attribution isn’t always possible. Our transparency approach has focused on activity we can confidently attribute to a state actor. Emergent behaviors, including the use of disinformation-for-hire vendors and increasing operational security, sometimes make confident attribution impossible based solely on Twitter’s own data. This doesn’t make the activity in question less important to analyze, but our policies presently prevent dataset disclosure in these cases. Moreover, access to this data, without attribution, may allow experts to piece together operations across multiple platforms and services that is not possible by just one company. Information operations are just one area of public concern. We’ve provided an unprecedented level of transparency about state-backed information operations, given their severe impact on public discourse around the world. As Camille François and evelyn douek have pointed out, other content moderation domains of equal public concern don’t receive the same treatment. Where we’re headed in 2022 With these lessons in mind, as well as the emergent risks we see to the physical safety of our employees around the world tied to potential disclosures, we’re changing our approach in an effort to continue to provide expanded transparency about our content moderation actions. Here’s what you’ll see in the coming months: In early 2022, we will launch the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) — a global group of experts from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism studying platform governance issues. Membership in the consortium will be granted to groups or individuals with: - A proven track record of research on content moderation and integrity topics (or affiliation with a group that does such research, such as a university, research lab, or newspaper). - Appropriate plans and systems for safeguarding the privacy and security of the data provided by the consortium. We will be fully public about the standards used to determine membership in the consortium, and will bias towards inclusion and access, particularly for emerging researchers and researchers from historically under-represented communities and parts of the world. Twitter will not exercise any control or judgment over the findings or focus areas of the research produced using this data by members of the consortium. The more than 200 researchers around the world with existing access to our unhashed information operations datasets will be invited to join the consortium through an expedited process. Other qualifying individuals and institutions are welcome to apply. We will share additional details about this process in early 2022 in advance of any disclosures to the consortium. We will provide comprehensive data about attributed platform manipulation campaigns to members of the consortium, who may independently choose to publish their findings on the basis of the data we share and their own research. Under this model, we will also begin to share data about platform manipulation campaigns for which we have not been able to arrive at confident attribution to a state actor, and campaigns where we are unable to provide broad access due to employee safety concerns. Later in 2022, we will for the first time share similarly comprehensive data about other policy areas, including misinformation, coordinated harmful activity, and safety. As part of this change, we will discontinue our fully public dataset releases, prioritizing release to the consortium. Existing datasets will continue to be available for download indefinitely — and our public data offerings, including free access to our APIs (including the full archive of Tweets) remain available. Our efforts in this space are underpinned by our Privacy Policy which has long informed people how we may use the data they share with us. This includes sharing or disclosing information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services. As we highlighted in our position paper setting out principles for policymakers drafting new regulations, we urge policymakers to build protections for this kind of data sharing into the laws that govern data privacy. Transparency is core to our mission. Our goal with these changes is to provide more transparency about more issues, while grappling with the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges in this space. We’ll continue to learn and iterate on our approach over time and share those findings publicly along the way. 7 June 2022 Today, we’re opening up the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium to a limited group of researchers. We’ll use this initial period to gather learnings and make adjustments to program design, where needed, ahead of our forthcoming public launch. Feedback from these researchers will help shape and inform our work. During this period, membership will be open to applicants who were granted access to our information operation data sets during prior disclosures. Researchers with prior access may re-apply for the Consortium during this phase, and will be evaluated in line with the below updated criteria: Hold a primary institutional affiliation with an academic, journalistic, nonprofit, or civil society research organization. If they are students, they must be master’s or PhD level students; undergraduate students are ineligible at this time. Have prior experience and relevant skills for data-driven analysis. Consortium datasets are primarily shared as JSON files and require technical skills to analyze. Demonstrate a specific public interest research use case for the data provided by the Consortium. (“Public interest research use case” means non-commercial research for journalistic, academic, or non-profit/civil society purposes.) Equipped with industry-standard plans and systems for safeguarding the privacy and security of the data provided by the Consortium. Consortium members are required to sign a data use agreement. Later this year, we’ll open up the application for Consortium membership to the wider public and share key learnings from the beta period. As we’ve said previously, transparency is core to our work here. Through this updated approach, we aim to share more about what we’re seeing on the Twitter service, while addressing the safety, security, and integrity challenges that accompany these disclosures. Down the line, we’ll disclose data about other policy areas, including misinformation, coordinated harmful activity, and safety. More to come. 24 August 2022 We’re sharing an update on our Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) program. In the coming days, our TMRC global partners – the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and Cazadores de Fake News – will publish independent research about Twitter’s latest information operation data sets. These 15 data sets include platform manipulation campaigns originating from the Americas, Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (EMEA), and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). As we noted last year (above), we will now prioritize sharing information operations data with the Consortium. While we continue to share data with researchers about the networks we remove – including Twitter's assessment of the presumptive country of origin, based on the technical signals that we observe – we will no longer provide specific attribution information. Meaning, we won’t publicly disclose whether an information operation was carried out by a specific state actor, or other actor. Our goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter, while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. Information operations are also increasingly hard to attribute to specific actors – this change allows us to disclose data from a broader set of coordinated campaigns. Further, this change will allow researchers to piece together operations across multiple platforms and services, beyond what’s possible with just one platform. We continue to draw learnings from the initial early access period. We’re focused on developing a global group of Consortium members, and to date, have accepted applications from researchers around the world. Later this year, we’ll open the TMRC application process to a broader group of researchers. Down the line, we intend to share data about a wider range of Safety and Integrity policy areas."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/disclosing-state-linked-information-operations-we-ve-removed","date":"2021-01-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Disclosing state-linked information operations we've removed","text":"Twitter first published a comprehensive, public archive of data related to state-backed information operations three years ago. We’ve made improvements, outlined our principles, and iterated on our approach over time. Since that first disclosure in October 2018, we’ve shared 37 datasets of attributed platform manipulation campaigns originating from 17 countries, spanning more than 200 million Tweets and nine terabytes of media. Today, we’re disclosing an additional 3,465 accounts to our archive of state-linked information operations — the only one of its kind in the industry. The account sets include eight distinct operations we’ve attributed to six countries – Mexico, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Russia, Tanzania, Uganda, and Venezuela, respectively. Every account and piece of content associated with these operations has been permanently removed from the service. In addition, we have shared relevant data from this disclosure with three leading research partners: the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), Cazadores de Fake News, and the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO). In most instances, accounts were suspended for various violations of our platform manipulation and spam policies. See more via our Transparency Center. Below, we’ve outlined information about our latest disclosure. In the future, we’ll share key insights with the public, and more comprehensive data will be shared with our global consortium. Mexico We removed a network of 276 inauthentic accounts that shared primarily civic content, in support of government initiatives related to public health and political parties. People’s Republic of China We removed a network of accounts that amplified Chinese Communist Party narratives related to the treatment of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang. Today, we’re releasing a representative sample of 2,048 accounts. We also removed a network of 112 accounts connected to “Changyu Culture,” a private company backed by the Xinjiang regional government. Russia We removed a network of 16 accounts linked to the IRA that attempted an information operation in the Central African Republic. The operation relied on a mix of inauthentic and real accounts to introduce a pro-Russia viewpoint into Central African political discourse. We also removed a network of 50 accounts that attacked the civilian Libyan government and actors that support it, while voicing significant support for Russia’s geopolitical position in Libya and Syria. Tanzania We removed a network of 268 accounts utilized to file bad faith reports on Twitter, targeting members and supporters of FichuaTanzania and its founder. A subset of accounts also Tweeted pro-government content primarily associated with #chaguamagufuli2020. Uganda We removed a network of 418 accounts engaged in coordinated inauthentic activity in support of Ugandan presidential incumbent Museveni and his party, National Resistance Movement (NRM). Venezuela We removed a network of 277 Venezuelan accounts that amplified accounts, hashtags, and topics in support of the government and its official narratives. Many of the individuals behind this abuse had authorized an app, “Twitter Patria,” to access their accounts and timelines. We suspended the “Twitter Patria” app, a set of account holders leveraging and managing it, and a series of similar apps. We believe we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the public conversation and to offer meaningful transparency into our findings. Disclosing these datasets remains core to that mission. We continue to assess our principles and approach to these critical disclosures, and have learned a number of lessons along the way. As we look ahead, learn more about our future disclosures here, and keep up with the latest at @TwitterSafety."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter","date":"2021-01-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Official Twitter Blog","Company"],"title":"Bringing more reliable context to conversations on Twitter","text":"We’re excited to share that Twitter is collaborating with The Associated Press (AP) and Reuters to expand our efforts to identify and elevate credible information on Twitter. We are committed to making sure that when people come to Twitter to see what’s happening, they are able to easily find reliable information. Twitter will be able to expand the scale and increase the speed of our efforts to provide timely, authoritative context across the wide range of global topics and conversations that happen on Twitter every day. How Twitter currently surfaces credible information and context Twitter’s Curation team helps give people context to make informed decisions about what they see on Twitter. When large or rapidly growing conversations happen on Twitter that may be noteworthy, controversial, sensitive, or may contain potentially misleading information, Twitter’s Curation team sources and elevates relevant context from reliable sources. People currently see this added context and reliable information in the following places on Twitter: Trends. To help explain a top Trend, we often attach additional context to the Trend in the form of a Moment, a single Tweet, or via a written description. Explore Tab. Explore catches you up on a range of subjects, curated just for you. This is where Twitter shows you what’s happening right now. It includes Moments created by Twitter and third parties like news organizations, as well as Trends. Search. When people search for a hashtag or a phrase on Twitter, certain keywords determined by Twitter will automatically show content at the top of the results from trusted resources or Moments that debunk misinformation. Prompts. During the highest visibility events, such as elections or public health emergencies, Twitter will show prompts in the Explore tab or the Home Timeline that link to a public service announcement (PSA) Moment. These can include information from trusted sources on topics like how to vote safely in a pandemic or trustworthy information about getting vaccinated. Labels. Sometimes a Tweet violates our Synthetic and Manipulated Media, COVID-19 or Civic Integrity misinformation rules but may remain visible on Twitter. In those instances, a label may be added to the Tweet that links to a Moment with informative context on the topic or to the Twitter Rules. How this program will help expand these efforts Through this program, Twitter’s Curation team will increase our capacity to add reliable context to conversations happening on Twitter. This joint work will increase the scale and speed of the current work outlined above by: Increasing and improving context sharing: Ensuring that credible information is available in real time around key conversations as they emerge on Twitter, especially where facts are in dispute or when Twitter’s Curation team doesn’t have the specific expertise or access to a high enough volume of reputable reporting on Twitter. For example, people on Twitter can expect more Trends with contextual descriptions and links to reporting from trusted sources more frequently. Anticipating and proactively identifying emerging conversation: Proactively providing context on topics garnering widespread interest including those that could potentially generate misleading information. Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation. Improving the effectiveness of product features: Supporting product experimentation and existing initiatives where additional credible context could make our work better. For example, Birdwatch will use feedback from AP and Reuters as one way to assess the quality of information elevated by Birdwatch participants. During this initial phase of the program, AP and Reuters will focus on English-language content. Trust, accuracy and impartiality are at the heart of what Reuters does every day, providing billions of people with the information they need to make smart decisions. Those values also drive our commitment to stopping the spread of misinformation. We're excited to partner with Twitter to leverage our deep global and local expertise to serve the public conversation with reliable information. Hazel Baker Head of UGC Newsgathering, Reuters AP has a long history of working closely with Twitter, along with other platforms, to expand the reach of factual journalism. This work is core to our mission. We are particularly excited about leveraging AP’s scale and speed to add context to online conversations, which can benefit from easy access to the facts. Tom Januszewski Vice President of Global Business Development, AP How will this program work with the enforcement of the Twitter Rules? The scope of this program is independent of the work Twitter’s Trust & Safety teams do to determine whether Tweets are in violation of the Twitter Rules. AP and Reuters will not be involved in enforcement decisions. What’s next? We expect our efforts to grow over time and the nature of the work may evolve as we learn, observe, and scale our efforts to provide support across languages and timezones, globally. This program is just one part of our ongoing efforts to help people understand the conversation happening on our service. People experience a range of public conversations on Twitter every day, and we’re committed to continuing our work to elevate credible information and context."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/our-new-search-prompt-to-help-people-find-credible-information-about-hiv","date":"2020-12-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Partners","Company"],"title":"Our new search prompt to help people find credible information about HIV","text":"Today we launched another global expansion of our #ThereIsHelp notification service with a dedicated search prompt for HIV-related information across Asia Pacific and the Americas: Brazil, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, SP-Latam, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. This notification prompt will provide valuable and authoritative resources around HIV and encourage people to reach out and get help when they need it. Building on our #ThereIsHelp notification service currently available for mental health and suicide prevention, vaccination, child sexual exploitation, COVID-19, gender-based violence, and freedom of expression; this work is part of our efforts to ensure people have access to high-quality public health information and resources. When people search for keywords associated with HIV, the top search result will now include a notification in local languages, encouraging them to reach out for credible information and sources of help — be it websites or hotlines of local public health authorities or nonprofit organizations. Twitter will continue to work closely with public health authorities and leading NGOs that provide critical emergency care, testing, emotional support, and counselling services to ensure that the keywords that generate the notification prompt remain relevant. Some of the search keywords include but are not limited to: English: #AIDS, #HIV, #PEP, #PrEP, #KnowYourStatus Bahasa Indonesia: penyakit menular seksual, #LSL Bahasa Melayu: ditularkan secara seksual, Kesihatan Seksual Filipino: #LoveYourselfPH Hindi: #विश्वएड्सदिवस Japanese: エイズ, 抗レトロウイルス療法 Portuguese: #AIDS, #HIV, #PEP, #PrEP, #Sorologia Simplified Chinese: #艾滋, #世界艾滋病日 Spanish: #SIDA, #VIH, #PEP, #PrEP, #Serología Thai: #เอดส์, #เอชไอวี Traditional Chinese: #愛滋, #世界愛滋病日 Forty years since the first AIDS cases were reported, HIV still threatens the world. But ending AIDS requires ending inequalities, which necessitates transformative change. The course corrections we need to end AIDS will also protect the world against future pandemics. Therefore, we are very pleased to partner with Twitter in our journey ahead. This World AIDS Day, we’d encourage everyone to use #ThereIsHelp to access critical information around HIV, and remind ourselves that global inequalities affect us all, no matter who we are or where we are from. Together with Twitter, we hope to move societies from commitment to action by widening access to authoritative information, encouraging dialogue and shaping public discourse towards creating healthy and inclusive societies. Mahesh Mahalingam Director, Communications and Global Advocacy, UNAIDS We’re committed to protecting the health of the public conversation on Twitter — ensuring individuals can find credible information from authoritative sources is a key part of that mission. We also recognized that it is crucial for the public to have access to a free and #OpenInternet in combating the stigma around HIV. Therefore, we are partnering with public health authorities and local nonprofit organizations across Asia Pacific and the Americas to provide people with access to accurate information about HIV via launching a dedicated #ThereisHelp notification prompt for HIV. HIV stigma during COVID-19 HIV remains a major issue to public health in 2021, despite significant progress having been made in recent decades. Division and disparity for human rights have long been the contributing factors to the difficulty faced by people living with HIV. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult by exacerbating inequities and disruptions to services related to HIV. In 2020, around 800,000 children aged 0-14 years were living with HIV with no access to HIV treatments. This year’s theme of World AIDS Day is “End inequalities. End AIDS.” with a special focus on highlighting the growing inequalities in access to essential HIV services. WHO is calling on global leaders and citizens to rally to confront the inequalities that drive AIDS and to reach people who are currently not receiving essential HIV services. Data from Twitter shows that conversations about HIV spikes around #WorldAIDSDay on December 1 every year. In 2020, there were close to 9 million Tweets about HIV globally, out of which over 1 million Tweets were generated in December 2020. At Twitter, we recognize our role and responsibility to help ensure that people can access and receive support on our service when they need it the most. The various communities on Twitter are a source of positive support and are thriving; encouraging each other who may be struggling with stigma or lack of information around HIV, and to reach out for professional help. United to help provide more access to information We recognize that access to a free and #OpenInternet and collaboration — public, private and community — is the key to combating the stigma around HIV. As local organizations continue to use Twitter as a channel to identify and reach out to vulnerable people who they may otherwise not have contact with, and to raise awareness of their important services; we hope that the #ThereIsHelp notification service will complement these efforts. Below are our trusted NGO and government partners in this initiative that have made the #ThereIsHelp HIV notification prompt possible in 30 markets and in 12 languages. We will continue to expand these prompts in other markets in the near future.

We’ve rolled out features and settings that may help you to feel more comfortable and in control of your experience, and we want to do more to reduce the burden on people dealing with unwelcome interactions. Unwelcome Tweets and noise can get in the way of conversations on Twitter, so we’re introducing Safety Mode, a new feature that aims to reduce disruptive interactions. Starting today, we’re rolling out this safety feature to a small feedback group on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com, beginning with accounts that have English-language settings enabled. Here’s how it works Safety Mode is a feature that temporarily blocks accounts for seven days for using potentially harmful language — such as insults or hateful remarks — or sending repetitive and uninvited replies or mentions. When the feature is turned on in your Settings, our systems will assess the likelihood of a negative engagement by considering both the Tweet’s content and the relationship between the Tweet author and replier. Our technology takes existing relationships into account, so accounts you follow or frequently interact with will not be autoblocked. Authors of Tweets found by our technology to be harmful or uninvited will be autoblocked, meaning they’ll temporarily be unable to follow your account, see your Tweets, or send you Direct Messages. You can find information about the Tweets flagged through Safety Mode and view the details of temporarily blocked accounts at any time. Before each Safety Mode period ends, you’ll receive a notification recapping this information. We won’t always get this right and may make mistakes, so Safety Mode autoblocks can be seen and undone at any time in your Settings. We’ll also regularly monitor the accuracy of our Safety Mode systems to make improvements to our detection capabilities. How we got here We want you to enjoy healthy conversations, so this test is one way we're limiting overwhelming and unwelcome interactions that can interrupt those conversations. Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks. Throughout the product development process, we conducted several listening and feedback sessions for trusted partners with expertise in online safety, mental health, and human rights, including members of our Trust and Safety Council. Their feedback influenced adjustments to make Safety Mode easier to use and helped us think through ways to address the potential manipulation of our technology. These trusted partners also played an important role in nominating Twitter account owners to join the feedback group, prioritizing people from marginalized communities and female journalists. “As members of the Trust & Safety Council, we provided feedback on Safety Mode to ensure it entails mitigations that protect counter-speech while also addressing online harassment towards women and journalists. Safety Mode is another step in the right direction towards making Twitter a safe place to participate in the public conversation without fear of abuse.” ARTICLE 19 a human rights organization that champions digital rights and equality We also committed to the World Wide Web Foundation’s framework to end online gender-based violence and participated in a series of discussions to explore new ways for women to customize their experience with safety online using features like Safety Mode. What’s next We’ll observe how Safety Mode is working and incorporate improvements and adjustments before bringing it to everyone on Twitter. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build on our work to empower people with the tools they need to feel more comfortable participating in the public conversation."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/updates-to-our-work-on-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation","date":"2020-12-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["COVID-19","Health","Partnerships","Policy","Safety","Company"],"title":"Updates to our work on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation","text":"Effective November 23, 2022, Twitter is no longer enforcing the COVID-19 misleading information policy. As the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines expands, people continue to turn to Twitter to discuss what’s happening and find the latest authoritative public health information. In December, we shared updates on our work to protect the public conversation surrounding COVID-19. Starting today, we will begin applying labels to Tweets that may contain misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines, in addition to our continued efforts to remove the most harmful COVID-19 misleading information from the service. Since introducing our COVID-19 guidance, we have removed more than 8,400 Tweets and challenged 11.5 million accounts worldwide. We are also introducing a strike system that determines when further enforcement action is necessary. We believe the strike system will help to educate the public on our policies and further reduce the spread of potentially harmful and misleading information on Twitter, particularly for repeated moderate and high-severity violations of our rules. Enforcement details: Labels will first be applied by our team members when they determine content violates our policy. Those assessments will be used to further inform our automated tools and to advance our proactive capacity to identify and label similar content across the service. Our goal is to eventually use both automated and human review to address content that violates our COVID-19 vaccine misinformation rules. Machine-learning and automated language processing takes time to be effective. As such, we will begin with English-language content first and use this same process as we work to expand to other languages and cultural contexts over time. Labels will appear in your set display language and may link to curated content and official public health information or the Twitter Rules. Our goal with these product interventions is to provide people with additional context and authoritative information about COVID-19. Through the use of the strike system, we hope to educate people on why certain content breaks our rules so they have the opportunity to further consider their behavior and their impact on the public conversation. This strike system is similar to our recent update to the Civic Integrity Policy. Individuals will be notified directly when a label or required Tweet removal results in additional account-level enforcement. Repeated violations of the COVID-19 policy are enforced against on the basis of the number of strikes an account has accrued for violations of the policy. One strike: no account-level action Two strikes: 12-hour account lock Three strikes: 12-hour account lock Four strikes: 7-day account lock Five or more strikes: permanent suspension As always, if you believe that your account was locked or suspended in error, you can submit an appeal. Partnerships: We are not only focused on enforcing the Twitter Rules, but also helping people find credible health information and partnering with the experts. We continue to work in close consultation with local, national, and global public health authorities around the world, most recently: Finding reliable information. Since January 2020, we have had a dedicated COVID-19 search prompt feature in place within the product. This means when someone searches for COVID-19, they are met with credible, authoritative content at the very top of their search experience. This has been expanded to over 80 countries worldwide and is currently available in 29 languages. In some countries the prompts now also include an additional button which links to COVID-19 vaccine specific information. Pro bono advertising. Through our Ads for Good grants, we continue to partner with nonprofits and NGOs around the world to elevate authoritative information on COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic we’ve supported these efforts across more than 35 countries on a pro bono basis. In addition, we have donated premium advertising products, including Promoted Trend and First View products, to elevate critical public health information such as @FEMA’s message about the agency's vaccination efforts and emergency relief locations during winter storms. Global cooperation. In February 2021, we participated in a global WHO policy consultation to present Twitter’s views on finding and implementing “innovative ways and best practices to address health misinformation in the social media sector.” We continue to host a weekly live Q&A event page for the WHO at #AskWHO. Addressing public questions on Twitter. This month, we facilitated a Twitter Q&A from @WHCOVIDResponse. The Q&A featured Dr. Anthony Fauci, US President Biden’s chief medical advisor, and other members of the White House COVID-19 response team. In India, we worked with the Ministry of Health to organize Vaccine Vartha, a weekly expert talk hosted on Twitter that enables vaccine experts to answer citizen questions. Encouraging healthy conversation. In January, in partnership with Team Halo, UNICEF, NHS, and the Vaccine Confidence Project, we activated an emoji hashtag #vaccinated to show support for vaccination. This builds upon our earlier efforts to encourage people to #StayHome, #WashHands, and #WearAMask. As health authorities deepen their understanding of COVID-19 and vaccination programs around the world, we will continue to amplify the most current, up-to-date, and authoritative information. We are all in this together, and we will continue to update you on our progress as we strive to play our part to protect the public conversation at this critical time."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/inclusion-and-diversity-report-may-2020","date":"2020-05-26T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Diversity","Company"],"title":"Inclusion & Diversity Report May 2020: Principles during a pandemic","text":"Although the world doesn’t look the same since our last post, our commitment to Inclusion & Diversity at Twitter has never been stronger. Since our last update, we transitioned more than 5,000 Tweeps to a fully virtual workforce, introduced new programs and benefits, and doubled down on inclusion in the age of COVID-19. We’ve accomplished a lot –– and learned some important lessons along the way. Here are the four key principles that have guided our Inclusion & Diversity response at Twitter: Put people first –– and really listen Our priority has always been our Tweeps, their safety, well-being, and security. In February, we were one of the first companies to announce a global WFH policy –– for us it was an easy decision. But it still required a massive amount of work to operationalize. We created Slack channels specifically to answer questions related to COVID-19, launched a COVID-19 focused global survey to take the pulse of our Tweeps, hosted more global all hands meetings to check in on everyone, and increased opportunities to connect virtually across teams –– especially our Business Resource Groups (BRGs). Working from home, and trying to work at home during a global pandemic are different. So we re-evaluated our global benefits to identify opportunities for enhancements. In addition to reimbursing expenses associated with Tweeps’ WFH setup, we also increased our investments in mental and physical health benefits, and explored ways to better support caregivers learning to navigate our new reality. Lead with empathy and flexibility Our deep listening produced some common themes. People were having difficulty focusing, and productivity was being impacted by the pandemic. This was especially true for Tweeps from communities of color, caregivers and/or those at higher risk of infection. So we introduced resources to help managers prioritize their own well being while managing a team, foster deeper empathy between managers and their direct reports, paused 2020 performance ratings, and made room for Tweeps to operate at reduced capacity when needed. In partnership with @TwitterParents, we launched a special listening session for parents. What we heard was that our recently-introduced supplemental child care benefit wasn’t having the impact that we hoped because of shelter in place orders. What parents –– and everyone –– needed was more flexibility to manage through the pandemic in a way that worked for them. So we introduced flexible work schedules for Tweeps who needed extra time to take care of themselves and their families, and coached managers on how to lean in to asynchronous work, allowing Tweeps to get their work done how and when it suits them. And since there’s no keeping the kids out of the home office, we launched a weekly storytime with Twitter leadership to give everyone a break. We emphasized decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce, even before the pandemic started, which allowed us to quickly transition our Tweeps to being fully virtual. The past few months have proven this works for us and we made working from home an option for everyone whose roles allow it, permanently –– even after the pandemic ends. This decision will help drive workforce diversity by ensuring anyone, anywhere, can work for Twitter. Cultivate allyship The virus doesn’t discriminate. Unfortunately, some people do. So we teamed up with @TwitterAsians to host Flock Talks for the entire company about COVID-19 and racism. We know there’s a direct correlation between conversations like these and the health of our workplace and our service. Tweeps from across the globe came together to share personal stories about the impact of COVID-19 and how people can be allies during the pandemic. We didn’t stop there. Via #TwitterTeamUp, we brought together a cross-functional group of leaders from BRGs, Product, Policy, and Trust & Safety to discuss the work being done to prevent misinformation around COVID-19 and anti-Asian rhetoric on the platform. We also launched a campaign focused on #AllyshipRightNow to address hate speech, encourage allyship, and create a space where personal stories from the Asian community could be shared. Conversation about COVID-19 in the US must include its disproportionate impact on diverse communities. Via #DiversityPartnerships, we’ve hosted a weekly series focusing on underrepresented communities to call attention to the unique challenges they’re each facing during this crisis. We’ve had 8 sessions featuring 26 speakers including: Marc Morial (@NatUrbanLeague), Sindy M Benavides (@LULAC), KD Chavez (@acluhawaii), Pamela Prince-Eason (@WBENCLive), John C. Yang (@AAAJ_AAJC), Fatima Goss Graves (@nwlc), Alphonso David (@HRC), and Jill Houghton (@DisabilityIN). Double down on BRGs We have seen record growth in membership and participation across our BRGs –– more than 30% increase since the beginning of the year. We’re using this as an opportunity to enhance new member onboarding, invest more in virtual events, and accelerate expansion to ensure representation across our global locations. 📣 @TwitterWomen Unfortunately, the arrival of COVID-19 in the US shuttered plans for Women’s History Month, so instead we hosted a virtual launch party featuring the stories of women from intersectional backgrounds worldwide. Flexibility was key, and our @TwitterWomen leaders rose to the challenge without missing a beat. The session was extraordinary and emotional, reaching more than 400 Tweeps across the globe. 📣 @TwitterFaith We committed to adding even more BRGs in 2020, and this January we were excited to introduce our newest BRG: @TwitterFaith. It’s time to move beyond merely “accommodating” faith, and instead, grow towards building a culture where faith, as part of someone’s identity, is welcomed, acknowledged, and celebrated. Spring, for so many people across the globe, marks holy months centered around faith, fellowship, family — and food. And so, @TwitterFaith launched #FaithFoodies. In the spirit of social distancing, Tweeps opened their homes to host cooking demos for traditional dishes, sharing stories of their family’s holiday traditions. @TwitterFaith also hosted its first ever Ramadan 101 workshop, giving Muslim employees the opportunity to build community, but also giving their colleagues, team members, and leaders a way to learn and practice allyship. Representation matters It might look a little different, but we’re still hiring! We’ve recently evaluated all of our open roles on our Careers site to ensure those listed align to our most urgent business priorities. During these uncertain times, we’re being even more deliberate about hiring, development, and promotions throughout the business to ensure we’re still advancing our workplace representation goals. Check out the latest numbers here. Our teams have been working hard to ensure that we can continue to bring the best and brightest talent to fill essential roles at Twitter. We know that times are tough right now so we want to make it easier than ever to connect with us because we want you to #JoinTheFlock. Now is the time to remain steadfast in our commitment to become the most inclusive tech company in the world. Now is the time to be consciously inclusive. Now is the time to come together. #UntilWeAllBelong"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/keep-it-on-making-your-voice-heard-to-end-internet-shutdowns","date":"2020-05-25T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Accessibility","Government","Society & Culture","Technology","Transparency","Company"],"title":"#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns","text":"As we continue to face the global coronavirus pandemic, one truth that has come to bear over recent weeks and months is that what we are experiencing knows no borders. One of the elemental things powering our shared resolve at this unprecedented moment is the connected nature of our world, connectivity that is driven by the Internet. But, what if the ability to gather and share critical information, access essential products and services, learn and work from home effectively, connect with our loved ones, and speak truth to power, was taken away from us? Unfortunately, this is the reality for many people around the world. A recent report from Access Now shows an increase in Internet shutdowns globally, with 213 documented shutdowns in 2019 and a concerning trend toward more targeted and prolonged shutdowns. Sometimes known as (Internet) ‘blackouts’ or ‘kill switches’, shutdowns can be highly targeted, focused on specific groups of individuals for the purposes of repressing dissent, to larger shutdowns which can deprive entire communities of essential information and isolate people from their support networks. The deliberate throttling of Internet speeds — increasingly a tool of repression — creates friction and barriers to entry for those who need it most. To help raise awareness of this important issue, Twitter is pleased to support the #KeepItOn campaign, with the launch of a special emoji. #KeepItOn is a coalition of more than 200 organisations — ranging from research centers to rights and local advocacy groups, detection networks, and media organizations — located within 75 countries around the world, fighting to end Internet shutdowns globally. Twitter's mission is to serve the public conversation. We are committed to protecting freedom of expression, while encouraging healthy and productive public conversations. Having access to the free and open Internet is a right that many have come to see as essential. It is a right that’s increasingly inseparable from free expression, self-determination, and self-actualization. Our right to access news, connection, and medical information on the open Internet is more vital than ever during this pandemic. For some, it may be existential. It acts as a distribution channel for the most up-to-date information on how to prevent the spread of the virus; a directory that points us to the services we need to stay healthy; and a place where we can gather with friends and family. And with our economies reliant on digital technologies and connectivity, an open Internet is a foundational pillar on which recovery must be built. Shutdowns can only impede this progress, unnecessarily walling off targeted communities and entire populations. We have also seen a worrying trend towards regulatory action that could see instances of shutdowns increase further. Some of this is motivated by an urgent need to tackle COVID-19 in any way possible — some isn’t — but the long-term result could be an Internet that is less open, less free, and less empowering for all. Throughout the past weeks and months, we have seen first-hand that the principles of net neutrality and how the open, borderless nature of the Internet has allowed us to stay connected. As we face this pandemic, Twitter is helping people find reliable information, connect with others, and follow what’s happening in real time. In March, we announced that we were contributing to two organizations working tirelessly to uphold the fundamental values of a free press during the pandemic. Additionally, a critical function of our service is providing a place where people can openly and publicly respond to their leaders and hold them accountable. Working with our partners across the globe, we’ve facilitated conversations and the sharing of authoritative and credible information through our #KnowTheFacts prompt, now available in approximately 80 countries, hosting Q&As with the World Health Organization on @Twitter, and launching a global campaign to support the #SafeHands campaign. We have seen a huge surge in sharing gratitude, with more than 250 million Tweets shared worldwide expressing appreciation since March 15, and celebrating those who are on the frontlines protecting us all. These campaigns and global initiatives would not have been possible without the global, open, and interconnected Internet. Today, to support this critical movement, we're encouraging people around the world to make their voices heard by using #KeepItOn. “Access to information and freedom of expression are the foundations of our democracy. During a global health crisis, we all should be working to facilitate people’s access to credible and timely information. Any attempt to throttle, stifle, and shut down the internet including social media during this pandemic and beyond will have a detrimental effect on our collective health and well-being.” says Berhan Taye, Senior Policy Analyst and Global Internet Shutdowns Lead at Access Now."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/testing-new-conversation-settings","date":"2020-05-19T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Testing, testing ... new conversation settings","text":"Twitter is where you go to see and talk about what’s happening. But sometimes, unwanted replies make it hard to have meaningful conversations. (Ahem, reply guys.) Since last year, we’ve been working to give people more control over their conversations starting with the ability to hide replies. We also began trying out new ways to start conversations with casual, fleeting thoughts. And now, we’re testing new settings that let you choose who can reply to your Tweet and join your conversation. Before you Tweet, you’ll be able to choose who can reply with three options: everyone (standard Twitter, and the default setting), only people you follow, or only people you mention. Tweets with the latter two settings will be labeled and the reply icon will be grayed out so that it’s clear for people if they can’t reply. People who can’t reply will still be able to view, Retweet, Retweet with Comment, and like these Tweets. For now, only a limited group of people globally on Twitter for iOS, Android, and twitter.com can Tweet with these settings, but everyone can see these conversations. Learn more in our help center. Being able to participate and understand what's happening is key for useful public conversation. So, we're exploring how we can improve these settings to give people more opportunities to weigh in while still giving people control over the conversations they start. In addition to this, we’re making it easier to read all conversations around a Tweet with a new layout for replies and more accessible Retweets with comments. One thing we know for sure is that you'll be creative with this update. Maybe you'll host a debate on the benefits of pineapple on pizza (#TeamPineapple) with fellow pizza pals or invite a panel of distinguished guests for a fireside chat. You could even play a game of tic-tac-toe for people to follow along without messing up your moves. We’re excited to see what you do! And as always, @ me with what you think."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/bot-or-not","date":"2020-05-17T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Bots","Company"],"title":"Bot or not? The facts about platform manipulation on Twitter","text":"Going back a few years, there’s been a lot of discussion of “bots” online. Over time, however, it’s become a loaded and often misunderstood term. People often refer to bots when describing everything from automated account activity to individuals who would prefer to be anonymous for personal or safety reasons, or avoid a photo because they’ve got strong privacy concerns. The term is used to mischaracterize accounts with numerical usernames that are auto-generated when your preference is taken, and more worryingly, as a tool by those in positions of political power to tarnish the views of people who may disagree with them or online public opinion that’s not favorable. There are also many commercial services that purport to offer insights on bots and their activity online, and frequently their focus is entirely on Twitter due to the free data we provide through our public APIs. Unfortunately, this research is rarely peer-reviewed and often does not hold up to scrutiny, further confusing the public's understanding of what’s really happening. Let’s break it down and explain the facts. What’s a bot? Based on what we’ve described above, there’s a lot of understandable confusion and we need to do a better job of explaining ourselves. In sum, a bot is an automated account — nothing more or less. Going back a few years, automated accounts were a problem for us. We focused on it, made the investments, and have seen significant gains in tackling them across all surfaces of Twitter. That doesn’t mean our work is done. What’s more important to focus on in 2020 is the holistic behavior of an account, not just whether it’s automated or not. That’s why calls for bot labeling don’t capture the problem we’re trying to solve and the errors we could make to real people that need our service to make their voice heard. It’s not just a binary question of bot or not — the gradients in between are what matter. That’s why we focus our attention on where the most critical work is. We call it platform manipulation. What’s platform manipulation? Our proactive work is focused on manipulation in many forms and that includes the malicious use of automation. As discussed, our policies in this area focus on behavior, not content, and are written in a way that targets the spammy tactics different people or groups could use to try to manipulate conversations on Twitter (rather than on what they're specifically saying). It’s important to note, not all forms of automation are necessarily violations of the Twitter Rules. We've seen innovative and creative uses of automation to enrich the Twitter experience — for example, accounts like @pentametron and @tinycarebot. Automation can also be a powerful tool in customer service interactions, where a conversational bot can help find information about orders or travel reservations automatically. This is incredibly useful and efficient for small businesses, especially at a time of social distancing. So what’s prohibited? Malicious use of automation to undermine and disrupt the public conversation, like trying to get something to trend Artificial amplification of conversations on Twitter, including through creating multiple or overlapping accounts Generating, soliciting, or purchasing fake engagements Engaging in bulk or aggressive tweeting, engaging, or following Using hashtags in a spammy way, including using unrelated hashtags in a tweet (aka \"hashtag cramming\") Our technological power to proactively identify and remove these behaviors across our service is more sophisticated than ever. We permanently suspend millions of accounts every month that are automated or spammy, and we do this before they ever reach an eyeball in a Twitter Timeline or Search. We also publish data on our removals every six months in the Twitter Transparency Report. What about tools like Botometer & Bot Sentinel? These tools start with a human looking at an account — often using the same public account information you can see on Twitter — and identifying characteristics that make it a bot. So in essence, the account name, the level of Tweeting, the location in the bio, the hashtags used etc. This is an extremely limited approach. As mentioned, an account with a strange handle is often someone who was automatically recommended that username because their real-name was taken at sign-up. An account with no photo or location may be someone who has personal feelings on online privacy or whose use of Twitter may expose them to risk, like an activist or dissident. Don’t like to add much of a bio or your location to your account? Some of us at Twitter don’t either. Even if all of these public details are put into a machine learning model to try to probabilistically predict if an account is a bot, when they rely on human analysis of public account information, that process contains biases — from the start. Let’s take some other everyday examples for clarity. Someone who Tweets 100 times a day with #SuperBowl could just be an extremely engaged individual who loves football (or hates it if their team is bad). If you care deeply about the environment and Tweet about it at a certain political moment when you and your friends want to make an impact, you’re not “political bots” — you're active citizens organizing an organic online campaign to drive change in your community. These tools do not account for these common Twitter use cases, how far we’ve come, and how things have evolved. As a result nuance can be lost. The outcome? Binary judgments of who’s a “bot or not”, which have real potential to poison our public discourse — particularly when they are pushed out through the media. That doesn’t mean we’re perfect. Of course not. It’s just that the threat has evolved and the narrative on what’s actually going on is increasingly behind the curve. If I see suspicious activity, can I report it? Yes. If you see suspicious activity, report it to us. We add your signal to the hundreds of others we use to inform our technical approach. If we want to create a healthy information ecosystem, we all have a part to play. We’ve reinforced these points many times and we will get stronger and more direct in our public efforts at this critical moment in the global public conversation. We’re keenly aware of our responsibility in this space. That includes protecting the integrity of our service, continuing to keep platform manipulation off of Twitter, and leading with transparency by sharing regular updates on our progress and learnings."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/why-social-data-is-key-for-brands-in-covid-19","date":"2020-05-13T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Why social data is key for brands in COVID-19","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/keeping-our-employees-and-partners-safe-during-coronavirus","date":"2020-05-11T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["COVID-19","Safety","Partners","Company"],"title":"Keeping our employees and partners safe during #coronavirus","text":"To see all of the latest steps Twitter is taking in response to COVID-19, visit covid19.twitter.com. May 12, 2020 #LoveWhereverYouWork Twitter was one of the first companies to go to a work from home model in the face of COVID-19, but we don’t anticipate being one of the first to return to offices. We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere. The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it’s safe to return. Here’s how we’re thinking about the next few months: Opening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs. With very few exceptions, offices won’t open before September. When we do decide to open offices, it also won’t be a snap back to the way it was before. It will be careful, intentional, office by office and gradual. There will also be no business travel before September, with very few exceptions, and no in-person company events for the rest of 2020. We will assess 2021 events later this year. We’re proud of the early action we took to protect the health of our employees and our communities. That will remain our top priority as we work through the unknowns of the coming months. #LoveWhereverYouWork March 11, 2020 Moving to mandatory work from home globally + supporting our employees Our top priority remains the health and safety of our Tweeps, and we also have a responsibility to support our communities, those who are vulnerable, and the healthcare providers who are on the front lines of this pandemic. To continue this push, we are moving beyond our earlier guidance of “strongly encouraging work from home” provided on March 2 and have now informed all employees globally they must work from home. We understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times. And we will continue to do all that we can to support our Tweeps, including: Paying our contractors, vendors and hourly workers For contractors and hourly workers who are not able to perform their responsibilities from home, Twitter will continue to pay their labor costs to cover standard working hours while Twitter’s work-from-home guidance and/or travel restrictions related to their assigned office are in effect. Additional resources to support parents As part of our ongoing global benefits support, Twitter is stepping in to ease additional expenses parents may be experiencing when their normal daycare closes due to COVID-19 by providing reimbursement for the additional daycare expenses incurred. Helping Tweeps set up their at-home offices All employees, including hourly workers, will receive reimbursement toward their home office set up expenses, and we are working with our vendors to ensure our contractors' work-from-home needs are met as well. We listened to employee feedback and expanded our policy to include home office equipment, such as desks, desk chairs, and ergonomic chair cushions. We’re also allowing Tweeps to expense online fees while working from home. #FlockTalk Last year, we introduced #FlockTalk, a program activated when Tweeps want to come together during difficult times to share what’s going on with them, find community, and be heard by our leaders. News around COVID-19 is impacting people in a number of different ways -- from schools and offices being closed, to serious health concerns, to racism towards communities, we’re all dealing with a lot. The Twitter Inclusion & Diversity team (@TwitterTogether) in partnership with @TwitterAsians will host a virtual #FlockTalk that acknowledges there’s a direct correlation between conversations between us, the health of our workplace, and the health of our service. Resource guides to make the work-from-home transition easier Working from home can be a challenging transition, so we’ve provided a variety of resource guides to help our employees continue to get the job done. We’re listing them here as well because at times like this, sharing insights and learning is so important. We’re all in this together and we want to help others outside of Twitter make their transitions to working outside of their offices easier. Working From Home Best Practices: We have shared the factors to consider to make sure Tweeps are ready to be productive and healthy. Some factors include workspace, communication, self-care, and logging hours. Overall, working from home doesn’t change your day-to-day work, it just means you’ll be doing it from a different environment. Managing a Distributed Team: Being a People manager means providing a consistent and positive employee experience for everyone on your team, regardless of location. This manager resource guide highlights the three key pillars of management: Strategy, Growth and Care. So what changes when your team is fully distributed? The good news—not much! These pillars still apply whether you manage a distributed or co-located team. Virtual Interview Guide: All interviews at Twitter will be done via video conferencing. A completely virtual interview has its benefits. It is ideal for introducing candidates to remote work cultures, and it is a great opportunity for candidates who will work remotely to get a sense for the experience of interacting with other team members remotely. While this Virtual Interview Guide is not a holistic Interview Guide, it instead focuses on the aspects of interviewing candidates remotely that differ from interviewing candidates in-person. We have also shared guides for working across time zones, utilizing collaboration tools to stay connected, and ergonomic tips for working from home and on-the-go. We’ll continue sharing information as we navigate these changes. It’s all in dedication to keeping our Tweeps and everyone around us healthy. We’re all in this together! March 2, 2020 Encouraging employees to work from home In addition to the travel, event and visitor restrictions that we previously shared, today we provided additional guidance as we look to protect the health and safety of our workforce. Beginning today, we are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they’re able. Our goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the COVID-19 for us - and the world around us. We are operating out of an abundance of caution and the utmost dedication to keeping our Tweeps healthy. We are working to make sure internal meetings, all hands, and other important tasks are optimized for remote participation. We recognize that working from home is not ideal for some job functions. For those employees who prefer or need to come into the offices, they will remain open for business. Our Real Estate & Workplace team is increasing deep cleaning and sanitizing in all spaces, as well as more visual reminders for personal hygiene best practices and pre-packaged, pre-composed, and pre-plated food options. Working from home will be mandatory for employees based in our Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea offices due in part to government restrictions. Our criteria will evolve over time as we get more information, and we will communicate to affected Tweeps as appropriate. While this is a big change for us, we have already been moving towards a more distributed workforce that’s increasingly remote. We're a global service and we’re committed to enabling anyone, anywhere to work at Twitter. March 1, 2020 Suspending non-critical business travel and events We recently shared information about the work we’re doing to surface the right information, to promote constructive engagement, and to highlight credible information around the spread of #coronavirus COVID-19. We will continue to update the public on these efforts this week. We also have the responsibility of ensuring that the health and safety of our employees and partners is not compromised. We have continued to monitor the situation closely and are adjusting our internal policies to respond to this rapidly-evolving situation. On February 29, we informed our people and started notifying partners that we are suspending all non-critical business travel and events. This policy is effective immediately and will continue until the World Health Organization or Centers for Disease Control deem it appropriate to step back from pandemic precautionary measures or when a vaccine becomes available. Our goal is to reduce the risk that anyone at Twitter might contract or inadvertently spread the virus. It is important that we take these proactive steps to protect ourselves and others and minimize the spread of COVID-19. There are enormous transnational efforts underway to tackle this virus. As a global company with a global workforce, we want to do what we can to help the success of these multi-stakeholder containment efforts. Temporarily suspending travel is an immediate and important step. We want to thank our people, partners and customers for their patience and understanding."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/twitter-for-good-2020","date":"2020-05-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"#TwitterForGood Day goes remote","text":"Our goal with Twitter for Good is to bring our company together to be a force for positive change in the communities we serve. While this happens in myriad ways every day at Twitter, we focus on two global days of service annually to harness this energy at scale for maximum impact. On May 8, we launched our first-ever fully remote Twitter for Good Day. It was fun, it was meaningful, and it required a complete shift in thinking as we all continue to battle #COVID19. It became clear in late February that this year would look very different. Our plan to revitalize parks, visit classrooms, and prepare and serve meals in local communities around the world ground to a halt. We faced a decision to cancel the day outright or to reimagine what it might look like for Tweeps to give back from their homesinstead at physical locations within the community. As it turns out, the decision was easy: The need in communities around the world had never been greater, and our employees were eager — and yearned — to give back. Q&A sessions with Jack In line with our global approach to Twitter for Good, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey kicked off the first ever remote day of service by hosting Periscope Q&A sessions live on Twitter with nonprofit leaders in every corner of the world. More than 130,000 people tuned in to hear these conversations with Project RockIt in Australia, SpunOut in Ireland, Voz de Comunidades in Brazil, the Houston Food Bank, and Code Tenderloin in San Francisco. These participating organizations — diverse in location, mission, and purpose — are all longstanding Twitter partners. As the world has shifted to care for their communities amid COVID-19, these conversations reflected the work of nonprofit partners and their agile response tomeet the needs of the people they serve. Activations and outcomes In total, we organized 52 projects, contributed more than 1,500 hours of service, and donated $165,000 (and counting) through our Employee Matching program in the month of May alone. Tweeps baked cakes in France for frontline workers, joined a conversation about the risks of domestic violence during COVID in Singapore, prepared food provisions for high-risk populations in Mexico, and faced the daunting challenge of trying to prove they are smarter than a 5th grader in a high-stakes trivia match with students at DeMarillac Academy in San Francisco. While Twitter provided a set of opportunities for every employee to volunteer, give, or learn, we know that many employees pursued a cause of their own. One example was the ingenuity of a Tweep who used a 3D printer to make mask straps for frontline workers. Through it all, the love, care, and compassion Tweeps felt for our community partners was alive and kicking; a testament to the power of service regardless of the events taking place outside Twitter. What’s next? Our first global remote day of service made this abundantly clear: Our community partners are struggling to meet the exponentially increased demand for their services, and we need to embrace our charitable giving, nonprofit partnerships and on-service support for these organizations now more than ever. This Twitter for Good Day showed us yet again that our community partners and our employees are extraordinarily creative, adaptable, and ready to meet the challenges of our communities. The strength of a virtual day of service is that it allows each of us to approach today’s pressing issues in our own unique way — empowered to innovate, adapt, and give back. Twitter for Good Day may occur only twice a year, but we know that the real work happens in between, every day and every week. The spirit of giving continues to take flight at Twitter, and we are committed to staying the course as long as it is needed, for our communities and all those in need."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/updating-our-approach-to-misleading-information","date":"2020-05-10T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Updating our approach to misleading information","text":"Effective November 23, 2022, Twitter is no longer enforcing the COVID-19 misleading information policy. In serving the public conversation, our goal is to make it easy to find credible information on Twitter and to limit the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content. Starting today, we’re introducing new labels and warning messages that will provide additional context and information on some Tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to COVID-19. In March, we broadened our policy guidance to address content that goes directly against guidance on COVID-19 from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. Moving forward, we may use these labels and warning messages to provide additional explanations or clarifications in situations where the risks of harm associated with a Tweet are less severe but where people may still be confused or misled by the content. This will make it easier to find facts and make informed decisions about what people see on Twitter. New labels and warnings During active conversations about disputed issues, it can be helpful to see additional context from trusted sources. Earlier this year, we introduced a new label for Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media. Similar labels will now appear on Tweets containing potentially harmful, misleading information related to COVID-19. This will also apply to Tweets sent before today. These labels will link to a Twitter-curated page or external trusted source containing additional information on the claims made within the Tweet. Depending on the propensity for harm and type of misleading information, warnings may also be applied to a Tweet. These warnings will inform people that the information in the Tweet conflicts with public health experts’ guidance before they view it. While false or misleading content can take many different forms, we will take action based on three broad categories: Misleading information — statements or assertions that have been confirmed to be false or misleading by subject-matter experts, such as public health authorities. Disputed claims — statements or assertions in which the accuracy, truthfulness, or credibility of the claim is contested or unknown. Unverified claims — information (which could be true or false) that is unconfirmed at the time it is shared. *We will continue to introduce new labels to provide context around different types of unverified claims and rumors as needed. How will we identify these Tweets? Our teams are using and improving on internal systems to proactively monitor content related to COVID-19. These systems help ensure we’re not amplifying Tweets with these warnings or labels and detecting the high-visibility content quickly. Additionally, we’ll continue to rely on trusted partners to identify content that is likely to result in offline harm. Given the dynamic situation, we will prioritize review and labeling of content that could lead to increased exposure or transmission. We’ll learn a lot as we use these new labels, and are open to adjusting as we explore labeling different types of misleading information. This process is ongoing and we’ll work to make sure these and other labels and warnings show up across Twitter. Embedded Tweets and Tweets viewed by people not logged into Twitter may still appear without a label. Serving the public conversation remains our overarching mission, and we’ll keep working to build tools and offer context so that people can find credible and authentic information on Twitter."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/how-likefolio-gains-unique-financial-insights-for-investors-with-twitter","date":"2020-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Twitter Data","Insights"],"title":"How LikeFolio Gains Financial Insights for Investors with Twitter Data","text":"Twitter has long been the place where people discuss what matters to them, including their opinions on brands, products, and lifestyle changes.

When covid-19 pandemic shutdowns occurred in March 2020, LikeFolio identified that mentions of dog and cat adoptions rose significantly on Twitter, surging over 68% in one month. LikeFolio’s analysis revealed two trends: 1. More pet adoptions meant consumers were buying more pet supplies. 2. Consumers were likely to value home delivery during the pandemic shutdown. Chewy, an e-commerce pet supply company, became a stock to monitor. As CHWY stock sold off with the broader market to under $23/share, LikeFolio’s data revealed a massive increase in consumer spending with Chewy. LikeFolio clients were made aware of this potential trade idea through LikeFolio’s data insights. One month after the LikeFolio analysis, CHWY stock doubled.

We used this as an opportunity to re-introduce Twitter Able with a new campaign that represents who we are, what we do, and our intersections: #DisabledAndAble. We want it known that people can be both disabled workers and able workers — that disabled employees are not less than, not there to simply accommodate. Disabled employees are equal employees who’s perspectives make Twitter, and the world, better for all. Twitter Able began a year ago, as a community of disabled and ally Tweeps working together to raise awareness, provide resources, and prioritize the needs of our community. We’re one of nine global Business Resource Groups (BRGs), working toward making Twitter a more inclusive and accessible company. Our work also includes healthy conversations with the people who use Twitter, as to further understand all that we can do to foster belonging. In a virtual world, there’s no better time to work together, and closer, even while we’re apart. As two engineers on Twitter Able we stayed busy this month with #DisabledAndAble global programming. We hosted a company-wide National Disability Employment Awareness Month kick-off event, where we shared Twitter’s journey to be a better employer and service to folks with disabilities. In Singapore, we hosted an event with SG Enable, an organization dedicated to enabling persons with disabilities and discussed mentoring and internship programs, and how Tweeps can get engaged. In Dublin, we hosted Mark Pollock, who shared his story of resiliency. He became the first blind person to race to the South Pole, and shared his story of strength after a fall which left him paralyzed. We also held an internal watch party for “Rising Phoenix” and invited a Paralympian for a fireside chat. And finally, on October 27, we also hosted #BehindThePlatform, a virtual event that discussed how @Twitter is working on #accessibility to develop a platform for anyone, anywhere, to use on any device. Empowerment, belonging, and community are our three BRG pillars. It’s how we will foster an environment that welcomes, that’s receptive, and that makes future Tweeps feel at home. And although we’re one BRG, our shared experiences range across intersectional identities, job functions, and interests - throughout Twitter. In a world where there’s so much uncertainty, accountability is prime for our progress. With 200+ global members, our work, advocacy, and community is evergrowing - not because of our numbers but because of our proximity to the problems we’re solving. We aren’t perfect and we’ve got a lot of work to do to make Twitter a more inclusive and accessible company. Want to track our progress? Follow @TwitterAble and @TwitterA11y. Want to help us?

This quarter, we take a closer look at the impact of #BlackLivesMatter for Tweeps in the US and around the world. Just when 2020 had done the most — it did more. It’s been a long overdue summer of racial reckoning in the United States and around the world, as advocates and allies raise their voices and demand an end to systemic racism, white supremacy, police brutality, and anti-Blackness. #BlackLivesMatter is a movement that transcends political parties or nation-states; it's grounded in a struggle for fundamental human rights — and the hashtag first appeared in 2013 right on Twitter. So not only does that mean it hits especially close to home for all of us at Twitter, but also, as a Black woman raising three Black children, this work is deeply personal. The road to racial equality is long, but I’m proud of the steps we’ve taken to lay the foundation for us to continue to drive progress. While this blog post is mostly focused on the urgent call for change within the Black community in the US, we know that this echoes throughout our work with underrepresented groups around the world. Let’s start with representation within our US workforce*: We’ve set an ambitious goal for 2025 of having at least 25% of our overall US workforce be underrepresented minorities — at least 10% of which will be Black Tweeps. These numbers aren’t nearly big enough, especially in technical and leadership roles, but they do show that Twitter strives to be a leader of our industry when it comes to representation of Black employees. Check out our latest workforce representation data in our Inclusion & Diversity Report. So once Tweeps walk through our (now virtual) doors, what do we do to make sure they #LoveWhereYouWork? Short answer: A lot… First, we want every Tweep regardless of location or job to understand their role in creating a culture where everyone is empowered to bring their full authentic selves to work, experience belonging, and do the best work of their career. It’s one of the first messages we deliver to all new Tweeps on Day One in #FlightSchool, our new hire orientation. This vision takes ongoing work, so we also empower Tweeps with courses like “Healthy Conversations” (how to respectfully navigate tough topics in the workplace), “Words Matter” (how to spot and interrupt microaggressions), and “Allyship @ Twitter” (how to be an ally to underrepresented people). We recently made these courses mandatory for all Tweeps around the world to ensure everyone is operating with the same understanding of what is expected from them. Our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are the lifeblood of inclusion efforts at Twitter and Blackbirds is one of our oldest, largest, and most well known. Founded in 2012, Blackbirds membership spans across our global offices. In the past year alone, membership has grown by more than 100% — a testament to the strength of our Blackbirds community and their allies. I want to take a moment to personally acknowledge the global leadership team of Blackbirds whose passionate commitment to this work makes us all better. Thank you, Keyaira Lock, Jade Williams, Marvin Williams, Sioban Massiah, Ola Idowu, Sheldon Louis, and Royce Haynes. These Tweeps — and all our BRG chairs around the world  — empower our next generation of leaders, foster a culture of inclusivity and belonging, and give back to the greater community. In addition to performing their core job function, they navigate the complexities, nuances, and emotional labor of sometimes being the only person who looks, loves, worships, or has lived like them. They do this work to empower our next generation of leaders, so that one day, they will no longer be the only. This work is essential to Twitter’s success — it is not a “side hustle” or “volunteer activity.” That’s why we recently introduced a new compensation program to formally recognize the global leadership team of all of our BRGs. Despite longstanding ongoing investments in this work, like many of you, this summer we were called to do even more. First, we hosted a series of #FlockTalks on racial justice and anti-Blackness in the US, EMEA, and JAPAC. #FlockTalks are Tweep-only sessions, designed to hold space for those who’d like to come together in community to share how they're feeling with one another. We believe there’s a direct correlation between conversations like this, the health of our workplace, and the health of our service. The #FlockTalks revealed that many of our Tweeps were struggling with emotions highly associated with trauma — anger, anxiety, sadness, depression, and numbness. So we created #TakeCare, a one-hour, virtual discussion featuring therapists and wellness experts specializing in racism and trauma, providing tools and guidance to help Tweeps unpack and process everything happening in the world. We also expanded our mental health benefits to increase ongoing access to Black therapists with expertise in anti-Blackness, systemic racism, and race-related trauma. Racism impacts communities around the world. That’s why nearly all of our global BRGs delivered programs that empowered Tweeps to reflect on, and take a deeper look at anti-Blackness across their respective communities: Twitter Alas hosted a four-part workshop series dismantling anti-Blackness within the Latinx community, featuring a wide array of global speakers across the Latinx diaspora, including Rosa Clemente (@rosaClemente), Zahira Kelly-Cabrera (@bad_dominicana), and Luana Genot (@luanagenot). Monique Melton (@MoeMotivate) joined Twitter Parents to discuss raising antiracist kids Twitter Open kicked off global Pride Month by unpacking the intersectionality of the Black and Queer communities with DeRay Mckesson (@deray). Twitter Stripes hosted a powerful conversation about #BlackLivesMatter and combating racial bias in the military, which featured veteran Tweeps as well as external speakers, Richard Brookshire, co-founder of the Black Veterans Project (@BlackVetProject), and Tonya Oxendine of Merging Vets and Players (@VetsandPlayers). Twitter Faith co-hosted a #PraiseBreak with Blackbirds for a moment of reflection, gratitude, and faith, with special guest DJ Diamond Kuts (@djdiamondkuts). Twitter Women facilitated a hands-on workshop called #CallYourGirlfriend on the historical context and understanding privilege and oppression with Melanie Brazzell of What Really Makes Us Safe (@WhatMakesUsSafe). Twitter Able hosted a global all-hands discussing allyship and solidarity with the black community. And Twitter Asians is planning an Anti-Racism series with the goal of providing participants with the knowledge and tools to become active in dismantling racism and prejudice in the Asian community. All summer, we demonstrated our solidarity and allyship on @TwitterTogether, and across other Twitter owned and operated accounts. We proudly joined the push for #PoliceReformNow, #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor, and our leadership and policy teams have been meeting with advocates and elected officials to help drive progress. We made sure Black mental health resources were front and center for anyone who needed them in this curated Moment. We published “How to be an ally right now: #BlackLivesMatter,” shared it with the world in a thread and blog, and helped everyone Diversify Your Feed. Last week, the verdict in Breonna Taylor's case once again showed us how much work we have to do. The system isn't broken, it's functioning exactly as it was intended to. And for those wanting to practice allyship, wanting to dismantle systems of oppression and change the status quo, we launched a new series of workshops for Tweeps with new content to reflect current events based on our four principles of allyship: Learn, Ask, Show Up, and Speak Up. Learn about approach in the Twitter Blog, “Allyship Right Now.” We also launched #TwitterTogetherTalks, a new series exploring racial equity, inclusion, and diversity. We started with best-selling author and scholar Dr. Ibram X. Kendi (@DrIbram) for a conversation with Tweeps about dismantling systemic racism and how to be an antiracist. Next up was award-winning writer, director, and advocate Janet Mock (@janetmock) to explore the intersectionality of movements and the importance of #BlackTransLivesMatter. Most recently, we hosted Anthony Ray Hinton (@eji_org) in conversation with @jack to explore racial injustice and brutality in policing and the impact of mass incarceration on Black communities. A common theme we heard was that between the pandemic and a summer of racial reckoning, Tweeps were tired. So we introduced a day of global rest for the company. It was so popular, we introduced four more. We also led our industry by announcing that Juneteenth would be a US holiday forevermore. For Tweeps outside the US, we identified regional emancipation dates to ensure everyone can observe this important day of reflection. On Juneteenth, we elevated Black voices and their Tweets to educate and celebrate Black joy. Across the nation, our Community and Culture team demanded racial equity and justice with powerful statements, reflected on billboards throughout cities at the center of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Our Social team partnered with Blackbirds to dedicate an entire day to a never-ending parade of creativity and a true love for life with #BlackJoy. We also commemorated with a @Twitter Voice Tweet from Opal Tometi (co-founder of #BlackLivesMatter), published a @TwitterTogether thread educating on what Juneteenth represents, and commissioned Black artists to update headers of Twitter owned and operated accounts. We also deepened our investments in the advocacy organizations on the front lines driving change, and empowered Tweeps to do the same by lifting our matching gifts cap. We made a $250,000 grant split evenly between the Equal Justice Initiative (@eji_org) and the National Association of Black Journalists (@NABJ). We dedicated #AdsForGood grants for nonprofit organizations to amplify #BlackLivesMatter voices on Twitter. As we did with COVID-19, we are offering free premium ad services for credible resources and voices from the movement on Twitter, such as the Spotlight and Promoted sections in the Trends/Explore tab and First View on the Home timeline for all users to see, just for example. In 2021, we’re introducing a more globally inclusive approach to our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy. One of the most powerful things we can do is promote healthy conversation on our service. We’ll continue to iterate on our policies and roll out new product features to do this. This is a part of ongoing work to expand our hateful conduct policy that started in 2018. As a part of this work, we quickly realized we don’t have all the answers, which is why we have developed a global working group of outside experts to help us think about how we should address dehumanizing speech around more complex categories like race, ethnicity, and national origin. This group will help us understand the nuances, important regional and historical context, and ultimately help us answer questions like how we address power and privilege on the service. Most importantly, we’ll continue to serve the public conversation and fight for racial justice and inclusion — and we won’t stop #UntilWeAllBelong."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/topics-behind-the-tweets","date":"2020-01-29T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Topics: Behind the Tweets","text":"Three months ago, we launched Topics to make it easier to find the most interesting conversations happening on Twitter about the things you love. Since then, people have asked to learn more about how Topics work. So, we want to provide some background on how specific Topics are selected, the process to find the best Tweets for you about these Topics, and how we seek to highlight healthy conversations. How Topics are chosen Right now, there are roughly 1,000 Topics you can follow via the Topic browser, which will then show you Tweets about those Topics in your Home timeline. And we’re adding new Topics almost every week. We add new Topics based on the volume and health of conversations happening on Twitter. We start by looking at the volume of conversation on Twitter: how much people are Tweeting, Retweeting, replying, and liking Tweets about that Topic. The more conversation, the more likely it will be evaluated for inclusion in our next batch of available Topics. Topics reflect the broader, lasting conversations people have about the events, people, and things they discuss. Once we’ve identified a new Topic, we then shift our focus to identifying the most relevant Tweets. Finding the most relevant Tweets on a Topic To find the full set of Tweets about a Topic, we use a combination of methods including looking at the text of Tweets as well as signals generated by machine learning solutions highlighting what Tweets might be about. At times, our teams and external partners may also help source accounts to be included in certain Topics. To find the most relevant Tweets, we start by identifying the people on Twitter who are most interested in a given Topic using using a combination of machine learning, curation, and keywords.* This could mean they Tweet a lot about the Topic or interact a lot with Tweets about the Topic. From there, we find the Tweets that are most interesting to those people, using additional algorithms that look at many signals from those fan accounts including what types of content they engage with or specific accounts that are most relevant. Our systems check to confirm these Tweets are relevant to the Topic by looking at a series of related keywords. Keeping Topics healthy A healthy conversation about Topics is one where you want and feel safe to participate. We’ve implemented a number of protections so that the conversations included in a Topic should be healthy and free from abuse. This includes working to not recommend Tweets for a Topic if the engagement is manipulated or spammy. We look at a number of underlying signals, including how others interact with both the Tweet and the author — things like reports, blocks, and whether people have dismissed similar recommendations by clicking “show less often” or muting closely-related keywords. These are just some of the signals we use when ranking and filtering the group of Tweets until we have a set we are confident recommending for that Topic. And, to be clear: Tweets that criticize, satirize, or disagree within a Topic are a natural part of a healthy conversation and are eligible for inclusion. These protections are on top of all of the health protections we’ve already put in place for other parts of Twitter. In addition to the processes described above, there are quality assurance checks with a globally distributed team of people to confirm Topics are accurately highlighting relevant and healthy conversations. If Topics are unfollowed frequently or Tweets within Topics are reported often, these could be signals that those Topic Tweets might not be pertinent and healthy. If this is happening, we may pause the Topic temporarily. We know people are trusting us by following Topics and that Topics offer additional amplification to Tweets, so we want to make sure we’re amplifying relevant, healthy conversations. Personalizing the Topic for you When you follow a Topic, the Tweets you see about that Topic in your timeline are personalized. Your past activity — like your Tweets and Tweets you’ve liked, replied to, or Retweeted — are used to identify the Tweets you'll find most interesting. Also, if you engage more with one Topic, like Dogs, versus another Topic, like cats, we’ll show you more of the Dog Topic. (Sorry cat lovers!) To wrap it up, let’s use one of my favorite Topics, BLACKPINK, as an example. For the BLACKPINK Topic, accounts regularly Tweeting about and engaging with the KPOP band generally or a specific band member, like a fan account, are found. From there, Tweets that would be interesting to those fan accounts are gathered using the method described above. Throughout this process, our systems are at work ensuring we are surfacing the conversations you want to see. From that narrowed pool, depending on what might be most interesting to you, say which band member you Tweet about or reply to Tweets about the most, you may see a Tweet about Lisa or Jennie. After all that, the best BLACKPINK Topic Tweet for you is ready to be shown in your Home timeline! This is just the start, we’ll keep working to improve Topics. We hope you like it. 👍 If you don’t see a Topic you want to follow yet, don’t worry. We’re adding new Topics almost every week. Topics are available in English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and Korean. We’d love to hear how you are liking Topics. Do the Topics you follow show interesting Tweets? When you follow a Topic, do you see too many or too few related Tweets? We’ll keep tweaking our systems to make Topics better. You can give feedback on Topic Tweets by tapping the down arrow on the Tweet and choosing “Show less often.” *Updated July 2, 2020 to elaborate on how Tweets about a Topic are discovered and clarify that for certain Topics, our teams and external partners may help source accounts to be included."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/authoritative-information-about-novel-coronavirus","date":"2020-01-28T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Helping the world find credible information about novel #coronavirus","text":"As the global conversation continues around the spread of novel #coronavirus, we want to share the work we’re doing to surface the right information, to promote constructive engagement, and to highlight credible information on this emerging issue.

During the election, New Zealanders turned to Twitter for breaking news and to have conversations about topics close to their heart, to stay connected with their communities, and interact with candidates and elected leaders. Here’s a look back at how the election conversation unfolded on Twitter. Election conversation resulted in 1.5M Tweets (a potential 7B impressions globally) during the campaign period from 18 August - 18 October 2020* Conversations spiked on election night with Tweet volume jumping 530% once the media silent period lifted There was a 200% increase in the number of mentions of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Twitter during this campaign, compared to the 2017 general election when @JacindaArdern accounted for 24% of the mentions in conversations about the election Twitter lit up during the 24 hours prior to polls closing on Election Day Source: Trendsmap, 16-17 October 2020 7:00pm NZT According to the New Zealand Electoral Commission, It’s estimated that 82.5% of people across the country voted in this election – the highest number since 1999. During the campaign period, we launched a special emoji featuring a kiwi bird to help drive conversation about the civic process. Overall, these were most Tweeted about hashtags during the election. #nzpol #LeadersDebate #nzelection2020 #yourvote2020 Conversation highlights from the New Zealand 2020 general election Kiwis encouraged each other to get out and vote Twitter reacts to Jacinda Ardern’s re-election As election results rolled in, leaders from around the world shared their congratulations on Twitter. The newly elected and the re-elected MPs turned to Twitter to celebrate and thank supporters Daily #NZElection2020 conversations covered the political parties, candidate, and policy discussions, but there were plenty of light-hearted moments and conversations on Twitter too. Pets at Polling Stations New Zealanders brought their furry friends to their local polling stations. Behind the scenes on the campaign trail Selfies and snacks were shared. The PM’s partner, Clarke Gayford kept it cool Offering up the catch of the day and a tongue in cheek review of the election result. A blast from the past Commentators drew parallels and shared insights into New Zealand’s political history. A COVID-19 safe voting experience New Zealanders discussed early voting options, and were especially excited about the ‘nice smelling’ hand sanitiser provided at polling stations. Serving the public conversation during and beyond #NZElection2020 The health of the public conversation on Twitter is critical during elections. Our expanded Civic Integrity Policy, Political Content Policy, and overarching Twitter Rules were in place to protect the election conversation as New Zealanders expressed their democratic rights. To date, New Zealand is one of the very few countries that held a nation-wide general election during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (South Korea and Singapore were other recent examples). To provide guidance and assistance on how Kiwis could safely vote during #NZElection2020, Twitter curated a special Events page with the NZ Electoral Commission (@ElectoralCommNZ) to help people find credible information on the topics they care about, key policies and issues, as well as how to enrol and vote in NZ or abroad. After an election wraps, Twitter continues to work with elected officials, government entities, industry peers, and others. Our goal is for citizens to be empowered to engage with each other, civil society, and their elected representatives through dialogue and healthy conversations. *Twitter internal data, 18 August - 17 October 2020"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/korean-election-2020","date":"2020-01-26T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Elections","Policy","COVID-19","Company"],"title":"Serving the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19","text":"South Korea held a nation-wide election amidst this COVID-19 global pandemic on April 15, 2020. Despite the challenges, the election recorded a historic 66.2% voter turnout, the highest in three decades for a parliamentary election. Twitter’s role was even more critical as campaigns went virtual and people relied more than ever on online information. As such, Twitter’s mission of serving the public conversation remained core, and we ensured Twitter supported the participatory discussion every step of this election cycle. Protecting the integrity of the #KoreanElection2020 conversation on Twitter In preparation, Twitter verified the accounts of 10 different regional election commissions, five political parties, and 94 candidates so that people could check the authenticity of information on the service. Two days prior to the election, @TwitterKorea also announced the official Twitter accounts of 140 candidates from eleven political parties and also the nine political party accounts that had also joined the live national conversation. By following these accounts, people were able to receive the latest updates including candidates’ pledges and campaign schedules, or to send a Twitter mention or direct message (DM) to ask questions. Fighting platform manipulation and spam was a high priority. In the service of protecting the integrity of the election conversation, Twitter partnered with the Korean National Election Commission (@necmedia2017) to tackle issues such as deliberate election disinformation and clear violations of the Twitter Rules. Throughout the cycle we took enforcement action against bad-faith accounts who tried to manipulate the service and spread misinformation around the election. Empowering and amplifying the election conversation To help support and drive the public's interest in the election on Twitter, we launched a custom emoji 20 days prior to the election day in partnership with the National Election Commission. The emoji symbolized the voting stamp and was automatically generated by hashtags #KoreanElection, #KoreanElection2020, #투표(Voting), #투표인증(ProofOfVoting), #투표하세요(PleaseVote), #투표했어요(IVoted), #21대국회의원선거(21stLegislativeElection), and #415총선(April15Election). From March 25 through April 25, a total of 90,109 conversations were recorded using the emoji. Government agencies also made important election announcements on Twitter as the election was held during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. The National Election Commission and the Ministry of the Interior and Safety (@withyou3542) both shared the code of conduct for safe voting and received positive feedback from citizens. During the month in the lead up to the election, a total of 3.8 million Tweets related to the election were generated from candidate campaigns to “#IVoted” selfies. On the weekend prior to the election, which was reserved for early voting, we saw 380,000 election-related Tweets and a record high voter turnout of 26.69%, the highest since the advance voting system was adopted for nationwide elections in 2014. The electoral reform in December 2019 lowered the legal voting age from 19 to 18 years old. 18-year-old voters shared the excitement of voting for the first time on Twitter. Civil society groups, especially youth organizations, drove conversations around this milestone and encouraged voting for all age groups and even ran a straw vote project for those aged below 18 to encourage participation in the civic engagement. On election day, more than 1.1 million related keywords were mentioned on Twitter with election-related terms dominating Trends. The most mentioned keyword in Korea was “개표방송(Ballot Counting Broadcast)” -- the country’s reputation for high-quality CGI graphics during vote counting proved true once again in this election where candidates were depicted as characters on a competitive duck boat ride, or even on a boxing match. The second most Tweeted keyword was “투표완료(Voting Complete)”, followed by “#Korea_wants_justice”, “어르신들(The Elderly)”, and “비닐장갑(Plastic Gloves)”. “비닐장갑(Plastic Gloves)” trended because voters were asked to put on disposable plastic gloves as a precautionary measure against viruses upon arriving at polling stations around the country. The live vote counting on Twitter by MBC News (@mbcnews) and Arirang TV (@arirangworld, @ArirangTVnews) also received much attention among global audiences and garnered over 1.1 million cumulative views in total. To highlight interesting global content about the election that received global attention, TwitterMoments (@TwitterMoments) curated six Moments in English, Japanese and Portuguese. Celebrities’ voting Tweets also drew attention from all over the world, particularly the millenial and Gen-Z dominated #Kpop fan base. BTS again proved its popularity when member 'Suga' Tweeted about his vote with a photo on the official BTS Twitter account (@BTS_twt). This Tweet alone was retweeted 490,000 times, got 1.64 million likes, and then became the 'Most Retweeted I Voted Selfie Tweet' during this election. Given the role and importance in popular culture #Kpop plays, its noteworthy that so many celebrities also joined the election conversation and showed their civic support; Sandara Park (@krungy21), Golden Child (@Hi_Goldenness), NCT DREAM (@NCTsmtown_DREAM), Rocket Punch (@RCPC_members), and Gong Minji (@mingkki21) also shared their “Proof of Voting” Tweets. The voting public also Tweeted their proof-of-voting photos. In the past people would receive a stamp on their hands, this time they shared their photos wearing masks and plastic gloves, or observing the strict social distancing protocols of 1-meter (3-feet) apart while at the polls. Protecting the public conversation continues to be Twitter’s top priority. We will continue to work to protect conversations on the service, particularly around election cycles, by investing in technology, developing new policies, and building meaningful partnerships to further our understanding of the political and social context within which Twitter operates."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/nation-states-exerting-power-online-sharing-data-can-guard-again","date":"2020-01-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data","Technology","Transparency","Company"],"title":"Nation states exerting power online - sharing data can guard against it","text":"Manipulation of the public conversation is a shared threat we all face, and must all address together. It is a human activity that - we all know - has been around for quite some time, and isn’t showing any signs of going away. It pre-dates the Internet and modern communications technology of course, but has adapted and changed as online spaces have emerged to become contested territories of geo-political competition. It would be naive to think that events and conversations in the future will not be targeted by bad actors - in addition to elections, conversations around Covid-19, climate action, identity and civil rights, to name a few, are all vulnerable to similar techniques. We have to respond. The first step towards doing so is by understanding the problem in detail — a goal that Twitter and think tank Demos believe can best be advanced through transparency and open access to data. Platforms like Twitter have taken a number of important steps to confront this problem, for example - having a dedicated site integrity team and continuous investment in technology to detect, understand and neutralize these campaigns as quickly and robustly as possible - but technology companies can’t do it alone. Academics, journalists and civil society groups must all be strong - and genuinely independent - voices in the debates related to information operations and how to respond to them. And to achieve this, one thing - above all - is needed: data. Data is the bedrock of a strong civic societal response to information operations. It is vital to allow researchers to detect information operations, understand what they’re targeting, what effects they’re having, the interests and organisations that are conducting them and measuring the effectiveness of responses to them. It is the way of making the information operations themselves, and the responses to them, transparent and inclusive. Transparency is foundational, indeed, to the kind of Internet that we all want to see - empowering consumers, building trust and strengthening democracies. And it is worth noting here that Twitter is the only major service to make public conversation data available via an API, for the purposes of study. Making this type of data available to researchers has resulted in a number of important benefits. First, publicly available data can advance research objectives on a wide range of topics and in a safe, compliant way with the public’s basic expectation of privacy. This has been the case particularly during Covid-19, where we have seen research teams use public Twitter data to map and examine aggregate increases in reported symptoms or anxiety levels. Second, it raises general awareness and increases understanding more widely of the scale and nature of the challenges impacting the integrity of public conversation online,. This is why in 2018, Twitter committed to disclose publicly, any state-backed information operations that were reliably identified on the service, and to make the full datasets of those operations available for investigation and analysis. Since this first release over two years ago, Twitter has now disclosed over 35 separate state-backed information operations designed to nefariously shape and manipulate public opinion online. Independent analysis of this activity by researchers is a key step toward promoting shared understanding of these threats and to help develop a holistic strategy for addressing them. And third, making this data available keeps platforms like Twitter accountable for their own response to these challenges. The nature of conversations taking place on Twitter is well-documented and, critically, members of the public, governments, and researchers can bring their expertise to bear to develop solutions for a range of online harms. However, as Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey has said, there is much more to do when it comes to transparency; and the team within Twitter who work with researchers are part of that, constantly looking for opportunities to provide new data while balancing privacy considerations. The reality, however, is that there are very different standards for transparency across the industry. One challenge is that so much research of online harms is built on Twitter data because they are one of the few companies to offer it. Another is the amplification of poor quality, non peer-reviewed and misleading “research” by some pockets of media and, on occasion, elected officials to suit a predetermined narrative. More broadly, we continue to encourage peer-reviewing of research and data before publication. To not engage in these practices, more often than not, results in public scare-mongering. Independent analysis of these activities by researchers is a key step toward promoting shared understanding of these threats, and this level of transparency can enhance the health of public conversation online, and protect the Open Internet for all. It’s our shared responsibility in academia, industry, policymaking, and research to consider how greater data transparency and support for civil society can be at the centre of our response to online harms. That need, much like information operations itself, isn’t going anywhere either. ___________________________________________________________________________ On Thursday 26th November, Twitter and Demos hosted a panel discussion on Data, Research and Information Operations.

According to the United Nations Population Fund, for every three months the COVID-19 lockdown continues, an additional 15 million women are expected to be directly affected by violence. As this so-called “shadow pandemic” continues, Twitter will continue to support nonprofit partners working to bring awareness to the uniquely intense strain the pandemic has had on women. We recognize that access to a free and open internet is essential, as people across the globe turn to social media services like Twitter to discuss women’s rights and other important social issues. In fact, women’s rights have dominated conversations on Twitter this year with 40 million Tweets so far and counting. In addition, since the start of COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, there have been 1 million Tweets per month about domestic violence and related issues. Services like Twitter that rely on the open internet are not only a medium for discussing the issues, but, for many, can be a lifeline and a means to seek help. Amplifying the conversation on Twitter In partnership with UN Women and the UN Human Rights Office, we are launching custom emojis to spread awareness on International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25 and Human Rights Day on December 10. The emojis will appear when people Tweet with the hashtags #GenerationEquality, #OrangeTheWorld, #16Days, #HumanRightsDay, and other localized hashtags. We are supporting local nonprofits across the world by providing Ads for Good grants to several partners to ensure that they can use the power of Twitter’s advertising platform to reach more people. Throughout the next #16Days, we will also amplify various regional campaigns and messages about the importance of gender equality and combatting violence against women to increase engagement and awareness. “We have seen the whole world respond to the coronavirus pandemic with all hands on deck, and with responsive investment and protocols backed by determination. Violence against women is also a pandemic — one that predates the virus and will outlive it. As we face COVID-19’s devastation, there has never been a more important moment to put our combined resources and commitment behind the biggest issues, and work with partners like Twitter to end violence against women and girls for good.” — Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director, UN Women Providing support and safety resources In addition to elevating the public conversation, we have partnered with health authorities and nonprofit organizations in various markets to expand our #ThereIsHelp notification service. When people search terms associated with gender-based violence on Twitter, they will receive a notification with contact information for local hotlines and other resources to encourage them to reach out for help. Since our initial rollout at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have expanded the prompts to reach 24 markets spanning countries such as Australia, India, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, the UK, the US, and more. This month, we rolled out dedicated gender-based violence #ThereIsHelp prompts in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy to broaden our support and efforts to provide helpful resources to people in need. The open internet has played a foundational role in the efforts of social media platforms like Twitter to connect people to helpful resources, healthy conversation, and community. We look forward to continued work to ensure that Twitter remains a safe place for people to shine light on critical and timely issues. Let’s continue to #OrangeTheWorld one Tweet at a time."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/help-us-shape-our-new-approach-to-verification","date":"2020-01-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Help us shape our new approach to verification","text":"Three years ago, we paused our public verification program after hearing feedback that it felt arbitrary and confusing to many people. A year later, we deprioritized this work further to focus on protecting the integrity of the public conversation around critical moments like the 2020 US election. Since then, we haven’t been clear about who can become verified and when, why an account might be unverified, or what it means to be verified. We know how important it is to be able to express yourself and understand who you’re talking to on Twitter. So today, we’re sharing the start of our plans to revamp how people can identify themselves on Twitter, starting with verification and asking the public to share feedback on a draft of our new verification policy. Calling for public feedback has become an important part of our policy development process because we want to ensure that, as an open service, our rules reflect the voices of the people who use Twitter. Building our verification policy We plan to relaunch verification, including a new public application process, in early 2021. But first, we need to update our verification policy with your help. This policy will lay the foundation for future improvements by defining what verification means, who is eligible for verification and why some accounts might lose verification to ensure the process is more equitable. We're starting by more clearly defining some of the core types of Notable Accounts that are served by verification. Per the proposed policy, “the blue verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic. To receive the blue badge, your account must be notable and active.” The six types of accounts we’ve identified to start are: Government Companies, Brands and Non- Profit Organizations News Entertainment Sports Activists, Organizers, and Other Influential Individuals You can find more detailed definitions of the criteria above in the draft policy here. We’ve also added proposed criteria to automatically remove verification from an account if, for example, it's inactive or if the profile is incomplete, as well as grounds to deny or remove verification from certain qualified accounts that are found to be in repeated violation of the Twitter Rules. We recognize that there are many verified accounts on Twitter who should not be. We plan to start by automatically removing badges from accounts that are inactive or have incomplete profiles to help streamline our work and to expand this to include additional types of accounts over the course of 2021. We know we can’t solve verification with a new policy alone -- and that this initial policy won’t cover every case for being verified -- but it is a critical first step in helping us provide more transparency and fairer standards for verification on Twitter as we reprioritize this work. This version of the policy is a starting point, and we intend to expand the categories and criteria for verification significantly over the next year. We want to hear from you What do you think? Here is a brief survey on our draft verification policy. We are also working with local non-governmental organizations and our Trust and Safety Council to ensure as many perspectives are represented as possible. If you prefer to Tweet your feedback, we'll be listening there, too. Use the hashtag #VerificationFeedback. The public feedback period starts today, November 24, 2020, and continues until December 8, 2020. At that point, we'll review public feedback on this policy and train our teams on this new approach. Our goal is to introduce the final policy on December 17, 2020. We’re committed to serving the public conversation by helping people find credible information, hear important voices, and trust the authenticity of the accounts people find on Twitter. Thank you for taking the time to be part of this process — we look forward to hearing what you think. What’s next? Being able to express yourself is core to the public conversation, and who you talk to is as important as what they’re saying. We want to make space for everyone on Twitter to express their authentic voices by giving people more ways to identify themselves in their Profiles. The blue verified badge and account labels are two of the ways we help distinguish notable, authentic accounts on Twitter. This year, we’ve verified medical experts Tweeting about #COVID19 and added account labels to identify candidates running for office. But the blue verified badge isn’t the only way we are planning to distinguish accounts on Twitter. Heading into 2021, we’re committed to giving people more ways to identify themselves, such as new account types and labels. We’ll share more in the coming weeks. This is just the beginning of what we have planned for 2021."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-continued-work-to-keep-twitter-secure","date":"2020-01-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Privacy","Transparency","Company"],"title":"Our continued work to keep Twitter secure","text":"At Twitter, we’re acutely aware of the role we play in society and we take that responsibility seriously. We have been, and will continue to be, focused on empowering the public conversation. To do this, we must protect the security and privacy of the people who use our service. You can see some of this work on Twitter, such as in the privacy and account security settings and controls we offer you, but a lot of it happens behind the scenes. We want to share more on the work we're doing to protect your account and keep Twitter secure. 1. Improving our access management processes and authentication systems. As we shared in July, we have teams around the world that need to access customer data to provide account services and keep Twitter running. For example, engineering team members have access to build and operate the features that people rely on every day. Other teams use proprietary tools to help with a variety of support issues including to review content for potential violations of the Twitter Rules and respond to user reports. We are constantly working to balance how we build products and provide support to people who use Twitter while ensuring the security and privacy of people who use our service. That means access is limited and is only granted for valid business reasons (i.e., ensuring an account holder can get support if they are locked out of their account). To further secure our internal tools from potential misuse, we have been strengthening the rigorous checks that team members with access must undergo. This also helps reduce the potential for an unauthorized person to get access to our systems. We have strict principles around who is allowed access to which tools and at what time, and require specific justifications for customer data to be accessed. 2. Improving our detection and monitoring capabilities. Similar to how we proactively detect and alert you of suspicious behavior on your account to help you keep it secure, we have internal detection and monitoring tools that help alert us of unusual behavior or possible unauthorized attempts to access our internal tools. These tools are constantly being improved, even since the July incident, to include things like expanding our detection and response efforts to include suspicious authentication and access activity. In addition to the improvements we’ve made on the backend, it’s important for you to have meaningful controls over your account security and privacy on Twitter. We recently implemented some of these security measures for a designated group of high-profile, election-related Twitter accounts in the US, and we encourage everyone on Twitter to enable security controls such as two-factor authentication and password reset protection. 3. Investing in tools and training for our employees and contractors. In addition to requiring Security and Privacy & Data Protection training for all newly hired Twitter employees, we introduced new courses and increased the frequency and availability of existing courses for all employees. For example, we introduced two new mandatory training sessions for people who have access to non-public information. These trainings make clear the dos and don'ts when accessing this information and ensure employees understand how to protect themselves when they are online so they can better avoid becoming phishing targets for attackers. In addition to existing security training courses, we’ve also enhanced training content on secure coding, threat modeling, privacy impact assessments, and privacy by design so privacy is integrated into everything we design and build by default. Our teams have also been investing in additional penetration testing and scenario planning to help secure Twitter from a range of possible threats, including in the context of the upcoming 2020 US elections. Specifically, over a five month period from March 1 to August 1, Twitter’s cross-functional elections team conducted tabletop exercises internally on specific election scenarios. Some of the topics included: hacks and other security incidents, leaks of hacked materials, platform manipulation activity, foreign interference, coordinated online voter suppression campaigns, and the post election day period. Internally, we’re rolling out phishing-resistant security keys and requiring our team to use them when authenticating to systems around the world. This is work we had already begun but have accelerated in recent weeks. This will help reduce the risk of an unauthorized third-party gaining access to our internal systems using compromised employee credentials. Finally, we continue to invest in and scale the processes in place to review products for security and privacy concerns before they launch. If a project could have significant privacy impacts, we conduct a detailed impact assessment to make sure we’re taking appropriate measures before we launch it. We’ve significantly increased the number of privacy reviews and impact assessments the past few years. Specifically, in 2018, we did about 100 privacy reviews; in 2019, we did almost 500 privacy reviews; and in the first 6 months of 2020, we have completed more than 300 privacy reviews. So what’s next? We are continuing to invest more in the teams, technology, and resources to support this critical work. We also know that we can do more to make it easier for you to find and use the settings and controls we offer, so we’re working on rolling out improvements to the design and navigation of our privacy settings. You’ll see these improvements in Twitter soon. We want you to have peace of mind when you come to Twitter that the data you share with us is secure, and that you understand and feel empowered to use the controls we offer you to keep your account secure. This will always be ongoing work for us, but trust that we are committed to acting in the interest of the people who use our service. Where we discover an issue, we will work quickly to fix it, learn from it, and hold ourselves accountable by keeping you informed."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/celebratingthepowerofyoungpeoplethroughyouthlead","date":"2020-01-23T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Partnerships","Socialmediadata","Society & Culture","Twitter for Good","Company"],"title":"Celebrating the power of young people through #YouthLead","text":"Young people make up more than half of the world’s population and they are the largest group of Internet users. On the 24th of September 2018, the UN launched Youth2030: The United Nations Youth Strategy. By partnering with young people, the UN Youth Strategy aims to recognise the resilience of young people around the world, address their needs and empower them to achieve their full potential. Two years on from the launch, through Twitter’s open and conversational nature, we’ve seen countless examples on Twitter of young people leading impactful movements around the world on issues like climate change and social justice - empowering them to have a voice on issues that matter most to them. Throughout August - #YouthMonth2020 - Twitter collaborated with the Office of the Secretary General’s Envoy on Youth to raise awareness of the work being done by the youth of today. We collaborated on #YouthDay through an on-service conversation with @UNYouthEnvoy, this activation highlighted the challenges faced by youth of today, as we navigate the global COVID-19 pandemic. In the spirit of marking the two year anniversary of the UN’s Youth 2030 Strategy, we also worked together on the first ever Twitter emoji designed by young people, for young people, across the globe. Through a series of engaging Twitter polls and threads from @UNYouthEnvoy, young people had their voices heard on the creation of an emoji that would represent them and the work they do; from deciding on the hashtag #YouthLead, to determining what design elements the emoji should include, to voting on the final emoji design. This emoji and hashtag aims to unify and drive an inclusive conversation on Twitter about the work young people are leading on in our local and global communities. To support this diverse and inclusive dialogue, the #YouthLead hashtag, is available in 20 different languages including Spanish, Korean and Thai. Today, on the two year anniversary of the Youth 2030 Strategy, we are happy to launch the chosen emoji, activated on Twitter through the hashtag #YouthLead. Through this emoji, we are inviting young people from all around the world to share their perspectives on what youth leadership looks like to them — highlighting the many innovations, challenges and successes that youth continue to experience everyday. Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, notes; ''Young people are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic — from its immediate challenges like disruption to education, loss of employment, increased mental health challenges, and increased gender-based violence both online and offline, to its long-term socio economic impacts, young people have undoubtedly been hit the hardest. But they rose up to the challenge. As they always are during times of crisis, young people were resilient and resourceful, and they stepped up to protect and support their communities regardless of the challenges they were facing. We are pleased to collaborate with Twitter to celebrate the resiliency and leadership that young people show every day on the streets, in the classrooms and in the frontlines by creating the #YouthLead emoji by young people, for young people to celebrate their contributions to build a more sustainable and peaceful word.” These ideas for the #YouthLead emoji were brought to life through the artwork of young artist Seqininnguaq Qitura Poulsen. Seqininnguaq is an emerging young Inuk/Kalaaleq leader from Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) where she works on indigenous and LGBTQ+ rights as well as education and mental health. Seqininnguaq is also part of the Global Indigenous Youth Caucus where she is leading as their Arctic Focal Point. When Seqininnguaq was bringing young peoples’ ideas to life with the emoji, it was important for her to highlight that young people can and should be empowered to have a powerful voice in important decisions being made, around the world. To mark the launch, Seqininnguaq had a special message to young people around the world: “I know you’re struggling and no matter how much you’re struggling and what it is you’re struggling with, there is always support and help. You will find your people, you will find a place where you feel safe, accepted and loved, I promise'' Celebrating the power of youth is something that we continue to prioritise at Twitter. Throughout the year, we have partnered with youth organisations across the globe to support them, as they make use of Twitter to engage in conversations leading to change. Our partnerships with organisations like the Office of the Secretary General’s Envoy on Youth, are key for us to stay engaged and educated on the needs and wants of the youth of today - we appreciate these collaborations and look forward to what partnerships like this can create in the future.

In 2019, in California alone, 6,872 fire incidents burned more than 253,321 acres, damaged or destroyed 732 structures, and killed three people. When it comes to wildfires, early detection can buy authorities time to warn impacted communities and get the right resources in the right place quickly. Up until now, first responders and disaster response coordinators have lacked easy access to real-time, on-the-ground data. Kian Mirshahi, founder of Mayday.ai, is passionate about democratizing access to disaster information and is working to build a community-level ecosystem for proactive disaster management and resiliency. When major events happen, people turn to Twitter to share what they’ve witnessed, document what’s happening in real-time, and to get key information. This wildfire season, Mayday.ai is set to combine data from the unfolding conversation on Twitter with its proprietary incident detection system, which is based on satellite sensors, an array of 35,000 traffic cameras, and IP911 to power a comprehensive detection and a highly targeted notification tracker. Mayday.ai has developed a comprehensive dispatch platform and a mobile app which will provide first responders and civilians unprecedented access to real-time incident information -- and has so far had much success in detecting wildfires using its proprietary platform and is being used as a template for other disasters in Mayday’s roadmap. Wildfires are one disaster that humans can prevent with a culture shift in disaster management policies and practices, Kian Mirshahi founder of Mayday.ai “The opportunity costs of our current reactive and disconnected practices are tremendous and continue to increase. Mayday’s proactive and integrated approach uses satellite imaging, multiple data sources, and machine learning capabilities to identify fires faster than anything else can.” So far this year, Mayday has detected almost all reported wildfires in the Americas ahead of 911 reports, with some as early as four hours. Mayday uses data from the conversation on Twitter to analyze social media sentiment and gain critical information from people at the scene. They track keywords and event-centric groupings with hashtags, for example, #Easyfire. Once a fire is named, that hashtag is used to track all data on Twitter and filter critical information to responders and continuously refined via natural language processing. Mayday is also providing visual data through geotagged images and videos shared on Twitter. These event-centric innovations with social sentiment analysis, combined with a multitude of sensors from 22,000 miles above sea all the way to ground-level, give Mayday.ai an incredible and highly disruptive edge in real-time disaster services. “We see Twitter as a source of critical information from citizen journalists and witnesses. We want people to Tweet when a disaster or incident strikes so this information can be used reliably to help inform authorities faster as the event unfolds. This is a best practice that we are building in our communities as we onboard them” said Mirshahi. Mayday is launching its platform this season in the Western States and will be fully available in the United Stated in early 2021. Mayday is also working with various global partners and expects to have its platform globally available by the end of 2021.

From the stories of healthcare workers on the frontlines, to analysis of the real human and economic cost of the pandemic, reporters around the world are still writing, still exposing themselves to harm, still giving us the facts. Journalism is core to our service and we have a deep and enduring responsibility to protect that work. This week we’re contributing to two critical organizations that are working tirelessly to uphold the fundamental values of a free press during this pandemic. We’re donating one million dollars evenly distributed between the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Women’s Media Foundation. These funds will be used to ensure these organizations can continue their work in the face of new economic strains and to directly support journalists. Their shared efforts to advocate for the rights of vulnerable reporters and to guarantee an equal share of voice for women in the industry has never been more relevant or important. “We are grateful for Twitter’s generous support. Our efforts at CPJ are focused on ensuring that journalists around the world have the information and resources they need to cover the COVID-19 pandemic safely. And we are pushing back against governments that are censoring the news, and restricting the work of the press.

Will work from home, learn from home and exercise from home be the new norm? Will bikes and walking begin to displace cars and crowded transit? Is business travel as we knew it finished? These questions and more are being asked by organizations trying to make sense of the past three months and the long term implications. Many will look to market research to try and understand what’s happening and predict the future. But after such an unprecedented event, can people clearly articulate how it has impacted their lives? This question hits at a much bigger challenge of market research and traditional methods such as surveys and focus groups: people aren’t very good at articulating what they think about certain topics or what they may do in the future. Traditional market research often asks consumers to share their feelings about products, services and experiences, but this approach is inevitably biased by virtue of the very questions presented and the specific words used. For example, 'How did you find your stay?' will elicit a different response than, 'Did you enjoy your stay?' This framing, as it is known, guides participants down specific paths, encouraging filtered, rational and retrospective responses. But, unfortunately, that’s not how we as humans make decisions. Previously, I wrote about how our emotions extend to decision-making and how numerous studies reveal that our behaviours are often guided by non-conscious drivers. Put another way, we are often unreliable witnesses to our own actions and beliefs. So how do we infer what people really feel on a subject? The key is to capture unprompted reactions in the moment when they are actually happening. These ‘non-framed’ thoughts tend to be more accurate and more authentic because they represent true emotion and are without bias. One place you can find a vast amount of unprompted reactions on a host of topics is social data. Twitter, in particular, sees hundreds of millions of thoughts, experiences and opinions shared on the platform every day. These tweets provide unique qualitative insights, shedding light on underlying motivations, emerging behaviours and new norms. Twitter has always been a great place to see these trends emerge, allowing you to develop hypotheses which can then be tested and further refined with qualitative and quantitative research methods. It’s this combining of stated preferences with revealed behaviours that provides a more complete, nuanced perspective on a given topic. Twitter is also proving a useful proxy for brand tracking and benchmarking studies. These well-established longitudinal studies typically rely on surveys and are generally performed only once a year. However, leveraging consumer feedback from Twitter makes continuous brand tracking possible and cost-effective. As to “what’s next?”, a YouGov poll from mid-April found that only 9% of Britons want life to return to 'normal' once lockdown is over. But can they be believed? To quote the American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, “What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.” Interested in obtaining better insights on topics important to you?

This year, Twitter Alas shared our global stories, wins, and experiences so that the world can fully recognize that power. From September 15 to October 15, we hosted events, amplified voices on platform, commissioned artists, and celebrated our first-ever virtual Hispanic Heritage Month. Being exclusively virtual, while not ideal, actually brought us together in more ways than in past years. Twitter Alas is a global community — connecting, learning, uplifting each other, and celebrating our power. Twitter Alas (“wings” in Spanish) is the global business resource group (BRG) for employees of Latino and Latin American descent, and anyone with an interest in Latinx culture and issues. From listening to great playlists and learning authentic Latinx recipes, to helping our community, our BRG helps create a sense of belonging for Tweeps. All month, we let our Tweeps do the talking. Around the world they came together to tell their most powerful moments and experiences in an inclusive narrative. These stories made so many feel heard and understood. There are certainly many obstacles we face being Latinx in tech, but to know that we all went through a powerful experience that allowed us to feel empowered to accomplish our goals was wholesome. Seeing how our Tweeps and community responded was reassuring that we are together in more ways than one. Throughout the month, we held many events, from cooking demos to Super Bowl choreography lessons to an event geared at tackling mental health stigmas in our community. We also held an event with four incredible Latinx leaders around the concept of Latinidad, moderated by our very own James Loduca. To celebrate our Latinx heritage we worked with three artists from around the world to visualize what Latinidad meant to them, and highlighted their work in our virtual Wall for a Cause. As the month came to a close, it was bittersweet. We were sad to see it go, but inspired to keep this energy going all year round. We are excited to take that energy we built during HHM to continue to find ways to bring our community closer together. BRG work is not just about our tentpole months, but about creating an environment that makes our Tweeps feel welcome and ensure that we are all able to bring our full selves to work. This is what makes BRG work so critical and what sets Twitter apart. BRGs help us all #LoveWhereYouWork. We are on a journey to become the world’s most diverse and inclusive company.

We strongly believe that everyone who is eligible should be empowered to vote, and we know that for many people this year, the safest and most reliable way to do so is to vote early. A recent Ipsos poll* of people in the US who use Twitter daily and found that: Nine out of 10 say they are registered and plan to vote in the 2020 elections Two thirds have already voted or plan to vote before Election Day One-in-three people are still seeking information about where and when to vote With this clear need for reliable early voting information in mind, Twitter is making our biggest early voting effort to date. What you’ll see Starting today and through the weekend, every person with a Twitter account located within the United States will see: A home timeline prompt designed to encourage them to vote early and look up their early voting options via BallotReady — a nonpartisan voting advocacy organization. People will also be encouraged to Tweet out these resources to help spread the word. Interactive features on all Tweets with the hashtags #VoteEarly, #IVoted, #IVotedEarly, #YoVoté including a custom emoji and an animated like button. A push alert directing to an on-Twitter Public Service Announcement with additional early voting resources. Engaging with the authoritative sources This election season, we also encourage voters to stay connected to their local election officials, which is why Twitter is a member of the #TrustedInfo2020 Initiative. We recently partnered with NASS and NASED to host more than a dozen Twitter Q&As from Chief Election Officials during National Voter Education Week to answer constituent questions about the election process. People in the US can also follow these lists from NASS and NASED for the latest information. As we approach Election Day in the US, Twitter will continue to share reminders with voting deadlines and resources.

Earth Day Network’s mission is to build the world’s largest environmental movement to drive transformative change for people and the planet. They seek to diversify, educate and activate environmentally-conscious people worldwide. At Twitter, we’re dedicated to supporting their work by democratizing access to information on why the environmental movement is critical to the health of our planet and its people. The 50th anniversary of Earth Day is a historic milestone. Amid two global threats, climate change and the pandemic, we must stand united as never before. As coronavirus drives us online, social media is more important than ever in connecting people and driving change. With Earth Day Network and Twitter working together, we will use our voices to create the largest, most diverse online mobilization. Kathleen Rogers Earth Day Network CEO Despite the uniquely challenging circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual commitments and activations will still be happening to work toward slowing the effects of climate change. Building on our work from last year, the #EarthDay emoji is active to celebrate the work of individuals around the globe who are committed to the cause. We also donated advertising credits again this year through our #AdsForGood program to help amplify the message. In addition to our partnership with the Earth Day Network, we’ve supported other organizations working to promote environmental conservation and sustainability. Through numerous engagements including events, #AdsForGood grants, on-service support, and trainings, we’ve helped them use the power of Twitter to amplify their work and raise awareness. These have included the global and/or local chapters of: United Nations (UN) Environment Programme, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UN Development Programme, Greenpeace, Voice for the Planet, Let Me Breathe, WWF, 350.org, FridaysForFuture, We Don’t Have Time, among others. The fight for the future of our planet has never been more important. On the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we’re thrilled to partner with the Earth Day Network and numerous nonprofit organizations around the globe to elevate the conversation around protecting our planet. At Twitter, we recognize how far we’ve come and acknowledge the critical work ahead of us. We’re committed to playing our part. Monique Meche Twitter Vice President, Global Public Policy and Philanthropy As we mentioned in 2019, our data centers represent an area of opportunity for us to think of our business through the lens of sustainability and to put our dedication into practice. We’re continuing to work toward our goal of achieving 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. While we work to reach that target, we’re also offsetting our current carbon emissions through the climate change and environmental nonprofit Cool Effect. Tweeps from around the globe voted last year and we selected three distinct projects as the financial beneficiaries of our offsetting initiatives: ☝️Protecting Brazil’s Jacundá Forest Reserve — This reserve strives to improve conservation of the rainforest while working to protect the livelihoods of those who live and work there. ✌️Tree planting initiatives in India, Kenya, and Uganda — This project helps small communities replant trees so they can counter the effects of poverty, deforestation, and harmful carbon emissions. 🤟A biodiversity protection project in Indonesia — Indonesia is losing forests at the rate of half a million hectares a year, which is one of the highest rates in the world. The Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve, the largest REDD+ project in the world, works to preserve these forests and stop development and deforestation. Once again this year, we’ll be building on these partnerships and continuing to support the areas where we’re making the largest sustainability impact. We made a decision early on for our employees globally to work from home to support efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19. Over the past year, we've also celebrated significant achievements in our Twitter offices and maintained momentum while working remotely. Highlights from our work leading up to the 50th anniversary include: Office Build-Outs: We will continue to work closely with our Real Estate and Workplace team to ensure that we’re retrofitting and installing environmentally-friendly water faucets and achieving at least 95% “Green Certified” status and using 100% Carbon Neutral Energy in our directly-leased buildings by 2025. To date, 92% of our global office space is Green Building Certified Spaces. Energy: In 2019, Twitter converted 300,000+ square feet of office space, or roughly 300kWh/mo of standard grid electricity to 100% renewable energy through PG&E’s Solar Choice Program in our San Francisco office. Sustainability Team: In 2019, Twitter’s Real Estate & Workplace team formally developed a Workplace Sustainability Team focusing on implementing sustainability standards and reducing our impact on the environment. This team also created resources for employees to encourage environmentally healthy habits, even as we work from home. Plastic Use: By reducing our single-use plastic consumption, we’ve effectively removed more than 100,000+ plastic straws, 70,000+ plastic toothbrushes, and 35,000+ single-use plastic beverage bottles from our offices per year. Recycled Products: We continue to strive to introduce and increase pre- and post-consumer recycled content in our office supply. In 2019, we introduced 100% recycled content mailer packages in our San Francisco mailroom and are still working toward our goal of utilizing 100% recycled paper products by the end of 2020. We’ve also partnered with TerraCycle in several offices to recycle products that otherwise would not be recyclable through existing municipal systems (i.e., plastic bags, plastic shipping material, pens, and other writing utensils). Composting: We’re actively composting in more than a third of our offices around the world to divert organic waste away from landfills — we will meet a 50% target in 2021. For example, after introducing this in our Atlanta office in 2019, we were able to divert 244 pounds of organic waste from landfills in less than six months. How Twitter employees are getting involved We’ve created an internal programming to encourage Tweeps to learn, participate in the conversation, and engage in remote volunteer activities to celebrate the day. We also set up a dedicated internal #EarthDay2020 campaign page through our employee donation matching program to support organizations working on environmental conservation and sustainability. Any Twitter employee can donate to relevant nonprofit organizations and Twitter will match donations up to a maximum amount per employee. What can you do? From charitable contributions, watching documentaries, and reading scientific material to DIY projects in your community or volunteering your time and talents — there are a number of ways for people to get involved in Earth Day, even while we #StayHome. We encourage you to Tweet using the hashtag #EarthDay to help spread awareness about the 50th-anniversary celebration and let the world know what you’re committed to doing this year to increase environmental sustainability. It’s on all of us."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/celebrating10yearsofkpoptwitter","date":"2020-01-20T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Celebrating 10 years of #KpopTwitter","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/twitterforgood-day-fall-2020","date":"2020-01-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Twitter for Good","Community Outreach","Partnerships","Charity","Company"],"title":"#TwitterForGood Day — Fall 2020","text":"On October 16, 2020, we kicked off our second remote Twitter for Good Day. Even amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, social unrest, and other challenges this year has brought, Tweeps across the globe were eager to give back and mirror the momentum and morale our nonprofit partners bring to their work everyday. Our #OneTeam had one mission; to bring our company and local communities together to be a force for good. We supported over 80 organizations working on the frontlines of causes ranging from homelessness to breast cancer awareness and all together, our employees volunteered 2,600 hours around the world! Check out a few highlights from this year’s #TwitterForGood Day activations. APAC Twitter Singapore organized an APAC #AuctionForGood, inviting Tweeps from across the region to bid on fellow Tweeps’ auction items which ranged from baked goods to 1:1 training sessions. The #AuctionForGood proceeds were donated to eight charities in the region. Twitter India partnered with our Inclusion and Diversity partners to host an allyship workshop. After the workshop, we hosted a conversation with groups including the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights and Blank Noise to deepen our understanding of issues marginalized communities in India face as well as how they use Twitter. In addition, Tweeps in APAC amplified the #MagingMabuti (#BeKind) campaign in an online Tweetchat with Phillipines-based organizations Mental Health PH and Silakbo Philippines and supported the #AkuBarhakBahagia Twitter campaign with suicide prevention activist @bennysiauw89 and clinical psychologist @nagotejena to raise awareness on mental health issues that people may experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also wrote letters to seniors experiencing loneliness for Connected AU’s Letter Box Project and sewed Yut Nori kits (a traditional Korean board game) with Braille for visually impaired children. Canada Twitter Canada hosted a conversation with @LalaaWrites, the creator of #ThisBlackGirl reads, to elevate and discuss her top 5 books about diversity and inclusion. Tweeps from around the world loved hearing about Lalaa's story, her book recommendations, and her tips and tricks for navigating life as a working Mom. EMEA In addition to a bake-off to raise breast cancer awareness and support local cancer NGOS, Tweeps across EMEA participated in various Twitter for Good Day activities, including a session with Age UK Westminster where we provided one-on-one assistance over video to help isolated older people with their digital devices to ensure that they’re able to stay connected with friends and family throughout this difficult time. Tweeps across the region also came together for a pay-to-participate regional quiz which raised money for Beat Eating Disorders in the UK, the Red Cross in Spain and Emmaus France. The Twitter Dublin office ran a number of online fundraising events to support the Irish Cancer Society, which included a yoga class and gaming competition. The Public Policy team trained over 60 Irish Cancer Society advocates on best practices for using Twitter to spread awareness of their work. In addition, members of our Human Resources team partnered with Project 668, a Brussels-based nonprofit working to fight unemployment through professional development, to help people prepare for job interviews. Tweeps also joined a session hosted by Twitter Able and Be My Eyes to learn more about ways to make the world more accessible to the blind community. LATAM Our Brazil team learned about the #PrisonLivesMatter campaign from activists @TatiNefertari and @_Queenrino, and donated basic cleaning and personal hygiene supplies to support their mission. We also participated in a Wikipedia edit-a-thon in partnership with Wiki Movimento Brasil to add more Wikipedia content on Black, Indigenous, and LGBT+ women in order to increase the representation of these groups on the platform. Over in Mexico, we supported La Cana, a project that seeks to create job opportunities for women in prison through programs and workshops on personal development and work training. Tweeps also donated money, clothes, hygiene products, shoes and toys to the organization. US Washington, DC Tweeps teamed up with Food for Others to assemble meal kits for elementary school kids in northern Virginia. Over in Miami, we partnered with TransSOCIAL to amplify the organization’s mission to expand resources for the transgender and gender-nonconforming population in South Florida. On the West Coast, we virtually created masks for young people experiencing homelessness with Larkin Street Youth Services. We also hosted a virtual career panel for high school students and recent alumni with the San Francisco 49ers Community Impact team. Though Twitter for Good Day happens only twice a year, the spirit and mission of giving back is central to our company and lives within us every day. A recap of our first remote Twitter for Good Day is available here."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/new-transparency-center","date":"2020-01-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Transparency","Company"],"title":"Introducing the new Twitter Transparency Center","text":"Transparency is core to the work we do at Twitter. The open nature of our service has led to unprecedented challenges around protecting freedom of expression and privacy rights as governments around the world increasingly attempt to intervene in this open exchange of information. We believe that transparency is a key principle in our mission to protect the Open Internet, and advancing the Internet as a global force for good. The fundamental belief in the power of open, public conversation inspired Twitter to launch one of the industry's first transparency reports back in 2012. At that time, our goal was to provide the public with regular insights into government pressure that impacted the public, whether through overt attempts at political censorship or by way of soliciting account data through information requests. The world has changed significantly since 2012. In 2020, it is more important than ever that we shine a light on our own practices, including how we enforce the Twitter Rules, our ongoing work to disrupt global state-backed information operations, and the increased attempts by governments to request information about account holders. Our new Twitter Transparency Center We have reimagined and rebuilt our biannual Twitter Transparency Report site to become a comprehensive Twitter Transparency Center. Our goal with this evolution is make our transparency reporting more easily understood and accessible to the general public. What’s new? Brand new website that includes all our disclosed data in one place Data visualizations making it easier to compare trends over time Country comparison module Tooltips to help explain key terms and provide more insights on the terms we use History of transparency milestones and updates New metrics and methodology on the enforcement of the Twitter Rules (from July 2018 through December 2019) New policy categories to better align with the Twitter Rules Reports will be published in Arabic, Turkish, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, and Portuguese very soon too, and we are continuing to iterate on the process to further contextualize the data. Our work to increase transparency efforts across the company is tireless and constant. We will continue to work on increasing awareness and understanding about how our policies work and our practices around content moderation, data disclosures and other critical areas. In addition, we will take every opportunity to highlight the actions of law enforcement, governments, and other organizations that impact Twitter and the people who use our service across the world. The data The latest data reflects the period July 1 to December 31, 2019. We endeavour to release this material as soon as possible every six months but due to a number of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and getting the new Twitter Transparency Center up and running, we have faced delays. The next update to the data will cover the period of January - June 2020. Our work on information operations: Our archive of state-backed information operations is updated on a rolling basis after we identify and remove them from Twitter. We have also increased our cadence of disclosures, recently sharing our largest disclosure to date with 32,242 accounts added to the archive. This archive, used by researchers, journalists and experts around the world, now spans more than 9 terabytes of media, includes over 83,000 accounts, and over 200 million Tweets and is an industry-first resource. We’ve now released datasets of information operations originating in more than 15 countries, offering researchers unique insight into how information operations unfold on the service. We’re also expanding how we work with partners in the research community to improve understanding of information operations and disinformation. Earlier this year we strengthened our partnership with two leading research institutions — the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) and the Stanford Internet Observatory — to enable their analysis and review of data related to our disclosures. We also hosted our first ever #InfoOps2020 conference in partnership with Carnegie's Partnership for Countering Influence Operations. The event brought together academic experts, industry, and government to discuss opportunities for collaboration and research on IO and support an open exchange of ideas between Twitter and the research community. Platform Manipulation: Our blog from earlier this year gives a thorough explanation about our proactive work to counter platform manipulation across the service and the common misconceptions around so-called ‘bots’ on Twitter. Our policies in this area focus on behaviour, not content, and are written in a way that targets the spammy tactics different people or groups could use to try to manipulate the public conversation on Twitter. Continuing a year-on-year trend, our proactive detection of this behavior has resulted in an almost 10% reduction in anti-spam challenges, e.g. when we ask people to provide a phone number or email address or fill in a ReCAPTCHA code to verify there is a human behind an account. Terrorism & violent extremism: The Twitter Rules prohibit the promotion of terrorism and violent extremism. Action was taken on 86,799 unique accounts under this policy during this reporting period. 74% of the unique accounts were proactively suspended using our internal, proprietary tools. We continue our close partnership with our peers as part of the Christchurch Call to Action and are committed to eradicating the presence of violent extremist content across our respective services. Child sexual exploitation: We do not tolerate child sexual exploitation on Twitter. Child sexual exploitation (CSE) including links to images of or content promoting child exploitation, is removed from the site without further notice and reported to The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). People can report content that appears to violate the Twitter Rules regarding Child Sexual Exploitation via our web form and we also investigate other reports via various reporting flows in-app for CSE too. There were 257,768 unique accounts suspended during this reporting period for violating Twitter policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. 84% of those unique accounts were proactively suspended using a combination of technologies (including PhotoDNA and internal, proprietary tools). Twitter Rules enforcement: For the first time, we are expanding the scope of this section to better align with the Twitter Rules, and sharing more granular data on violated policies. This is in line with best practices under the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation. Due to our increased focus on proactively surfacing violative content for human review, more granular policies, better reporting tools, and also the introduction of more data across twelve distinct policy areas, we have seen a 47% increase in accounts locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules. This work will never be stagnant and these stats should fluctuate as we improve and the challenge evolves. The increase is also reflective of a trend we’ve observed across our recent Twitter Transparency Reports, as we step up the level of proactive enforcement across the service and invest in technological solutions to respond to the changing characteristics of bad-faith activity on our service. Abuse/harassment As we tightened our rules and increased our use of technology and human review working in concern, there was a 95% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our abuse policy during this reporting period. This reporting period saw the largest increase in the number of accounts actioned under these policies. Hateful conduct Hateful conduct expanded to include a new dehumanization policy on July 9, 2019. There was a 54% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our hateful conduct policy during this reporting period. Sensitive media, including graphic violence and adult content There was a 39% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our sensitive media policy during this reporting period. Promoting suicide & self-harm We do not permit people to promote, advocate, and persuade another individual to engage in self-harm or suicide. There was a 29% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations for this type of behavior. This is the first time we disclosed this data as we reprioritized how this type of egregious content can be reported to Twitter expeditiously. Illegal or certain regulated goods or services A new addition to our data disclosures, there were 60,807 unique accounts actioned for violations of our illegal or certain regulated goods or services policy during this reporting period. Private information Sharing an individual’s private information — or so-called doxxing — without their express consent is a violation of the Twitter Rules. Internal tooling improvements allowed us to increase enforcement of this policy, and there was a 41% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our private information policy during this reporting period. Non-consensual nudity Due to internal improvements and extensive retraining specific to this enforcement area, this reporting period saw a 109% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our non-consensual nudity policy, the largest increase in the number of accounts actioned under this policy. Violent threats During this reporting period, we saw a 5% decrease in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our violence policies (Violent Threats and Glorification of Violence). Legal requests: In addition to enforcing the Twitter Rules, we also may take action in response to legal requests. Information requests (legal requests for account information): Governments and law enforcement agencies around the world submitted approximately 21% more information requests compared to the previous reporting period. Notably, the aggregate number of accounts specified in these requests increased by nearly 63%. The total volume of requests and specified accounts are respectively the largest we’ve seen to date since our transparency reporting began in 2012. We received government information requests from 91 different countries since 2012. Information requests from the United States continue to make up the highest percentage of legal requests for account information. During this reporting period, 26% of all global requests for account information originated within the United States. The second highest volume of requests originate from Japan, comprising 22% of global information requests. Anonymous and pseudonymous speech is important to Twitter and is central to our commitment to defend and protect the voices of the public. We often receive non-government information requests to disclose account information of anonymous or pseudonymous Twitter accounts (i.e., requests to “unmask” the identity of the individual), which we frequently object to. Twitter objected to 23 US civil requests for account information that sought to unmask the identities of anonymous speakers on first amendment grounds during this reporting period. We ended up litigating six of these requests. Twitter prevailed in four cases, lost one, and one is still pending. No information was produced in response to the other 17 requests. Removal requests (legal requests for content removal)*: In this reporting period, Twitter received 27,538 legal demands to remove content specifying 98,595 accounts. This is the largest number of requests and specified accounts that we’ve received since releasing our first Transparency Report in 2012. This record number of legal demands originated from 51 different countries. 86% of the total global volume of legal demands originated from only three countries: Japan, Russia, and Turkey. Legal demands from Japan increased by 143% this reporting period, accounting for 45% of global requests received. The 12,496 requests from Japan are primarily related to laws regarding narcotics and psychotropics, obscenity, or money lending. Copyright & trademark actions: Copyright violations: We received a 13% increase in DMCA takedown notices affecting 163% more accounts during this reporting period. Trademark notices: We saw a 7% increase in the total number of trademark notices received since our last report. This report reflects not only the evolution of the public conversation on our service but the work we do every day to protect and support the people who use Twitter. Follow @Policy and @TwitterSafety for continued updates on the changes we make across the company to drive meaningful and intuitive transparency. *Unless prohibited from doing so, we continue to publish legal requests when we take action directly to the Lumen Database, a partnership with Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/supporting-policy-change-and-service-reform-through-twitter-data","date":"2020-01-18T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Supporting policy change and service reform through Twitter data","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2021/looking-ahead-to-2021-twitter-data-partners-weigh-in","date":"2020-01-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["DataPartners","Twitter Data","Insights"],"title":"Looking ahead to 2021: Twitter Data Partners weigh in","text":"It’s hard to believe almost an entire year has gone by since our first blog featuring our Twitter Official Data partners who shared their 2020 perspectives on Twitter data and future trends. We’ve brought them back to hear their thoughts on what 2021 has in store and how brands should think about using data to inform their strategy next year. Here’s what they had to say: Social offers brands a real-time view of culture as it evolves. Marketers who tap into social data effectively can spot rising trends, uncover new perspectives and challenge assumptions about their customers. These social data leaders are the brands to watch in 2021. Jamie Gilpin CMO, Sprout Social The spread of COVID-19 has significantly changed our ways of living, including behavioral patterns. Many communications that were traditionally done offline are now moving online. We live in a world where those VoC and engagements happening on Twitter are critically important for marketers to drive business gains. Takumi Ryujin Executive Manager, NTT Data Customer Experience Management (CXM) is the next CRM. As brands focus on building their CXM practices, they will discover that Twitter is strategically critical because Twitter’s open format makes it the perfect place for brands to Listen to, Learn from, and Love their customers. Grad Conn Chief Experience Experience Officer, Sprinklr Consumer needs in the pandemic forced years of digital transformation into months. Our clients and our data tell us there’s no slow down in how those needs are evolving. So agility is the core theme: how well can your org loop through input, adjust, execute? Repeatedly. Will McInnes Chief Marketing Office, Brandwatch The fastest and most relevant real-time information is vital for corporate enterprises as they navigate a world of unexpected events that can impact their people, assets and brand. Enterprises must equip themselves with new technologies to meet the challenges of this environment. Ted Bailey CEO and Chairman, Dataminr As we look into 2021, there’s one thing that we know is true: it’s never been more important for brands to stay agile and adapt business strategies to the evolving needs of customers. Twitter will continue to be the heart of what’s happening, and with the help of Twitter Official data partners, brands can stay tapped into the pulse of the ever-changing conversation.

We will provide a more detailed technical report on what occurred at a later date given the ongoing law enforcement investigation and after we’ve completed work to further safeguard our service. What we know now The social engineering that occurred on July 15, 2020, targeted a small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack. A successful attack required the attackers to obtain access to both our internal network as well as specific employee credentials that granted them access to our internal support tools. Not all of the employees that were initially targeted had permissions to use account management tools, but the attackers used their credentials to access our internal systems and gain information about our processes. This knowledge then enabled them to target additional employees who did have access to our account support tools. Using the credentials of employees with access to these tools, the attackers targeted 130 Twitter accounts, ultimately Tweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and downloading the Twitter Data of 7. There has been concern following this incident around our tools and levels of employee access. To run our business, we have teams around the world that help with account support. Our teams use proprietary tools to help with a variety of support issues as well as to review content in line with The Twitter Rules and respond to reports. Access to these tools is strictly limited and is only granted for valid business reasons. We have zero tolerance for misuse of credentials or tools, actively monitor for misuse, regularly audit permissions, and take immediate action if anyone accesses account information without a valid business reason. While these tools, controls, and processes are constantly being updated and improved, we are taking a hard look at how we can make them even more sophisticated. This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems. This was a striking reminder of how important each person on our team is in protecting our service. We take that responsibility seriously and everyone at Twitter is committed to keeping your information safe. We’ve communicated directly with the impacted account owners and worked to restore access to any accounts who may have been temporarily locked out during our remediation efforts. Our investigation is ongoing, and we are working with the appropriate authorities to ensure that the people responsible for this attack are identified. What we’re doing to protect our service Since the attack, we’ve significantly limited access to our internal tools and systems to ensure ongoing account security while we complete our investigation. As a result, some features (namely, accessing the Your Twitter Data download feature) and processes have been impacted. We will be slower to respond to account support needs, reported Tweets, and applications to our developer platform. We’re sorry for any delays this causes, but we believe it’s a necessary precaution as we make durable changes to our processes and tooling as a result of this incident. We will gradually resume our normal response times when we’re confident it’s safe to do so. Thank you for your patience as we work through this. We’re always investing in increased security protocols, techniques and mechanisms – it’s how we work to stay ahead of threats as they evolve. Going forward, we’re accelerating several of our pre-existing security workstreams and improvements to our tools. We are also improving our methods for detecting and preventing inappropriate access to our internal systems and prioritizing security work across many of our teams. We will continue to organize ongoing company-wide phishing exercises throughout the year. We will continue to share updates and precautionary steps we take so that others can learn from this, too. We recognize the trust you place in us, and are committing to earning it by continued open, honest and timely updates anytime an incident like this happens. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- July 18, 2020 As we’ve been informing via the @TwitterSupport account, on Wednesday, July 15, 2020, we detected a security incident at Twitter and took immediate action. As we head into the weekend, we want to provide an overview of where we are. In this post we summarize the situation as of July 17 at 8:35p Pacific Time. The following information is what we know as of today and may change as our investigation and outside investigations continue. Additionally, as the investigation of this incident is unfolding, there are some details — particularly around remediation — that we are not providing right now to protect the security of the effort. We will provide more details, where possible in the future, so that the community and our peers may learn and benefit from what happened. What happened At this time, we believe attackers targeted certain Twitter employees through a social engineering scheme. What does this mean? In this context, social engineering is the intentional manipulation of people into performing certain actions and divulging confidential information. The attackers successfully manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter’s internal systems, including getting through our two-factor protections. As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets. We are continuing our forensic review of all of the accounts to confirm all actions that may have been taken. In addition, we believe they may have attempted to sell some of the usernames. For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “Your Twitter Data” tool. This is a tool that is meant to provide an account owner with a summary of their Twitter account details and activity. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true. None of the eight were verified accounts. Our actions We became aware of the attackers’ action on Wednesday, and moved quickly to lock down and regain control of the compromised accounts. Our incident response team secured and revoked access to internal systems to prevent the attackers from further accessing our systems or the individual accounts. As mentioned above, we are deliberately limiting the detail we share on our remediation steps at this time to protect their effectiveness and will provide more technical details, where possible, in the future. In addition to our efforts behind the scenes, shortly after we became aware of the ongoing situation, we took preemptive measures to restrict functionality for many accounts on Twitter - this included things like preventing them from Tweeting or changing passwords. We did this to prevent the attackers from further spreading their scam as well as to prevent them from being able to take control of any additional accounts while we were investigating. We also locked accounts where a password had been recently changed out of an abundance of caution. Late on Wednesday, we were able to return Tweeting functionality to many accounts, and as of today, have restored most of the accounts that were locked pending password changes for their owners. We are continuing our investigation of this incident, working with law enforcement, and determining longer-term actions we should take to improve the security of our systems. We have multiple teams working around the clock focused on this and on keeping the people who use Twitter safe and informed. What the attackers accessed The most important question for people who use Twitter is likely — did the attackers see any of my private information? For the vast majority of people, we believe the answer is, no. For the 130 accounts that were targeted, here is what we know as of today. Attackers were not able to view previous account passwords, as those are not stored in plain text or available through the tools used in the attack. Attackers were able to view personal information including email addresses and phone numbers, which are displayed to some users of our internal support tools. In cases where an account was taken over by the attacker, they may have been able to view additional information. Our forensic investigation of these activities is still ongoing. We believe that for up to 36 of the 130 targeted accounts, the attackers accessed the DM inbox, including 1 elected official in the Netherlands. To date, we have no indication that any other former or current elected official had their DMs accessed. [Added on July 22, 2020] We are actively working on communicating directly with the account-holders that were impacted. Our next steps As we head into the weekend and next week, we are focused on these core objectives: Restoring access for all account owners who may still be locked out as a result of our remediation efforts. Continuing our investigation of the incident and our cooperation with law enforcement. Further securing our systems to prevent future attacks. Rolling out additional company-wide training to guard against social engineering tactics to supplement the training employees receive during onboarding and ongoing phishing exercises throughout the year. Through all of this, we also begin the long work of rebuilding trust with the people who use and depend on Twitter. We’re acutely aware of our responsibilities to the people who use our service and to society more generally. We’re embarrassed, we’re disappointed, and more than anything, we’re sorry. We know that we must work to regain your trust, and we will support all efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. We hope that our openness and transparency throughout this process, and the steps and work we will take to safeguard against other attacks in the future, will be the start of making this right. More to come via @TwitterSupport as our investigation continues."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/the-journey-to-social-intelligence0","date":"2020-01-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"The journey to social intelligence","text":"14 years ago (March 21, 2006) Jack Dorsey sent the first Tweet signalling the beginning of a public conversation that has grown to encompass hundreds of millions of people around the world who share their thoughts, experiences and opinions as they happen. Not too long after that first Tweet our first API was launched, giving developers the ability to access and analyze data created from that public conversation. Like Twitter, the impact of social media data analysis has evolved considerably over the years. Today, people are tapping into Twitter data to support a broad array of information needs including measuring content and campaign performance, trend detection, influencer discovery and market research. Based on my experience and personal observations working with hundreds of organizations over the years, when it comes to putting this unique data source to work to support better decision-making, most organizations can be categorized within three stages of social intelligence maturity. In the first stage of maturity, it’s likely to be the marketing and communications teams engaging with social data - primarily using social media monitoring tools to track social media content performance and brand mentions for public relations and crisis alerting purposes. In fact, according to Twitter’s Social Data Insights Report (based on data from a study commissioned with the Harris Poll), 9 out of 10 companies use social data for marketing purposes. Metrics such as likes and follows as well as the volume of mentions and associated sentiment are front and center. At this stage, organizations tend to view social data analysis purely through an isolated lens of optimizing their social media campaigns and monitoring brand health. What’s missing is a broader awareness of the value that social data can provide across their organization. Companies at this emerging stage of maturity would benefit from a few simple efforts that could expose the wider business to the value of social insights. \"Oftentimes people have to experience social data for themselves before they really get it, so starting small with a defined project, and sharing relevant insights is key to growing adoption,\" says Jillian Ney, Founder of The Social Intelligence Lab. At the established stage, social media data analysis branches out from the marketing communications function and starts to be viewed as a useful source of consumer insights. It, however, tends to be leveraged in an ad hoc, reactive manner with requests bubbling up from different parts of the business to whoever has access and training on the organization's social listening tool. And due to this lack of clear ownership, organizations are slow to develop competencies in this area and tend to have multiple social media listening and analytics tools which are underutilized or not fit for purpose. And while organizations at this stage are starting to get clear value from social media data, for the most part it remains a siloed data source not used in conjunction with other research methodologies and/or data sources. Many organizations at this stage feel they have checked the box of social listening and yet are vastly underutilizing its potential. They would do well to clearly define their social listening objectives and align those with the key questions the business needs answering. An organization becomes an innovator when social media data is viewed as an important and unique source of consumer intelligence, helping to make more informed decisions across their business. As a result, it is embedded into their market research and customer feedback management efforts. In these organizations, you typically find a central analytics or consumer insights team driving cross-functional data analysis efforts that encompass social media data, integrating it with other data sources such as their own 1st party data. These organizations are not only advanced users of their social media listening and analytics tools but are also comfortable working with raw social media data and connecting directly to the social media platforms’ APIs. This allows them to pull social media data into their business intelligence tools to look for patterns and relationships between various data sets. Some may even employ their own approaches to NLP(natural language processing) for topic modelling and sentiment analysis. Organizations at this stage have gone beyond the simple volumetric analysis common of stage two behaviours and strive to understand the context behind social media conversations. Crucially, they understand social media data’s strengths, the questions it’s good at answering and when it should be utilized. Generally speaking, they excel at social media data analysis because they excel at data analysis and see it as a competitive advantage. In the fourteen years since Jack’s first tweet, social media data analysis has become an accepted part of consumer research. It’s not without its challenges and detractors, but remains an incredible realtime source of insight into our moods and mindsets as well as our views on anything and everything from the trendy to the mundane. It is the world’s largest focus group, unique in its ability to provide answers to questions we didn’t think to ask. So regardless of which stage of maturity you currently find yourself, if leveraging this giant focus group called Twitter is important to you, we are here to help.

This new policy will lay the foundation for future improvements by defining what verification means, who is eligible for verification and why some accounts might lose verification to ensure the program is more equitable. Public feedback has become a critical part of our policy development process by making sure our policies reflect the global nature of our service and the people who use it. In the two weeks during our public feedback period, we received more than 22,000 survey responses and learned so much about how we can improve our policy. Thank you for all you shared! How your feedback shaped our policy Here are some of the areas we’ve updated in our new verification policy based on your feedback: We heard feedback that some of the criteria for a profile to be considered “complete” feels too restrictive, so we updated our definition to no longer require a profile bio or header image. We updated our references to Wikipedia to better align with the encyclopedias' published standards for notability and article quality. We’ve clarified the titles of the “News” category to include “News and Journalists” and the “Sports” category to include “Sports and esports'' to be more inclusive. We also added a reference in our “Entertainment” category to more clearly include digital content creators. We heard feedback that measuring the minimum follower count requirement on a per-country basis wasn’t always the right approach, so we’ve updated this to be on a per-region basis to make our follower count requirements less susceptible to spam and more equitable across geographies. Many of you suggested we add categories for verification including academics, scientists and religious leaders, and we plan to explore adding dedicated categories for these to the policy some time next year. Until then, any of these individuals may qualify under the “Activists, organizers, and other influential individuals” category. For example, since March 2020, we have been working with global public health authorities to identify experts Tweeting about COVID-19 and have already verified hundreds of accounts as a part of this collaboration. These verifications will not be impacted by the new policy given the ongoing commitment to elevating credible information as it relates to the current public health crisis. You can read our new verification policy here, or you can tap on the blue verified badge in-app or on the web to learn more. We’ll begin enforcing this policy on January 22, 2021*, which is also when we’ll begin automatically removing the verified badge from inactive and incomplete accounts. Our new policy defines a complete account as one that has all of the following: either a verified email address or phone number a profile image a display name If your account is at risk of losing its verified badge, you’ll receive an automated email and an in-app notification informing you of what changes need to be made to avoid automatic removal of your blue verified badge. As long as you make those changes before January 22, 2021, your account will not lose its badge. We are not planning to automatically remove the verified badge from inactive accounts of people who are no longer living, and are working on building a way to memorialize these accounts in 2021. Under our policy, we may also remove verification from accounts that are found to be in severe or repeated violation of the Twitter Rules. We will continue to evaluate such accounts on a case-by-case basis, and will make improvements in 2021 on the relationship between enforcement of our rules and verification. As always, everyone on Twitter is subject to the Twitter Rules, and you can read more about our range of enforcement actions here. How to apply for verification in 2021 We are excited to relaunch public applications for verification in 2021 through a new, self-serve application process that will be available on the Account Settings page on the web and in-app. The process will include asking applicants to select a category for their verified status and confirming their identity via links and other supporting materials. We plan to use both automated and human review processes to ensure that we are reviewing applications thoughtfully and in a timely manner. We also plan to give people the option to share demographic information after completing the new verification application so that we can better measure and improve the equity of our verification process. We’ll share more details about the application process soon. What’s next? Verification is just one part of our work to help people understand who they’re interacting with on Twitter. We know that it’s not always easy to evaluate the authenticity of accounts on the internet, and that understanding who you’re interacting with is core to the public conversation. When it comes to helping people trust who they’re interacting with on Twitter, bios, Tweet content, mutual follows and profile information provide helpful context. This is why we’ve started rolling out profile labels for political candidates, government accounts, and state-affiliated media. In addition to the changes we're making as we re-introduce verification, we're also working on new ways to designate different account types, starting with: Automated Accounts: Accounts that post to Twitter automatically, also called bots, can bring a lot of value to the service when they share things like earthquake reports or self care reminders. But it can be confusing to people if it’s not clear that these accounts are automated. In 2021, we’re planning to build a new account type to distinguish automated accounts from human-run accounts to make it easier for people to know what’s a bot and what’s not. Memorial Accounts: We know how important it is to preserve a Twitter account in memory of someone who has passed and we’ve talked about building Memorial Accounts before. In 2021, we’re planning to build a new account type specifically designed for memorialized accounts. This will also come with an updated policy for memorialization and a new application flow to request the memorialization of an account. Our work here is far from finished, but we want to give you a look ahead at what we’re doing in this space so you can understand our approach. We are excited to relaunch verification and start rolling out these new account types, and we’ll share more soon. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback during the public comment period for helping us shape our new policy! * We had originally planned to begin enforcing this policy on January 20, 2021, but we have changed the date to January 22, 2021."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation","date":"2020-01-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Official Twitter Blog","Product"],"title":"Fleets: a new way to join the conversation","text":"This blog was updated on November 18, 2020, to share additional ways we’re working to keep people safe when using Fleets. Twitter’s purpose is to serve the public conversation – it’s where you go to see what's happening and talk about it. But some of you tell us that Tweeting is uncomfortable because it feels so public, so permanent, and like there's so much pressure to rack up Retweets and Likes. That’s why, unfortunately, there are so many 🔥 Tweets left in drafts! To help people feel more comfortable, we've been working on a lower pressure way for people to talk about what’s happening. Today, we're launching Fleets so everyone can easily join the conversation in a new way – with their fleeting thoughts. Fleets are for sharing momentary thoughts – they help start conversations and only stick around for 24 hours. Through our tests in Brazil, Italy, India, and South Korea, we learned Fleets helped people feel more comfortable joining the conversation – we saw people with Fleets talk more on Twitter. Those new to Twitter found Fleets to be an easier way to share what's on their mind. Because they disappear from view after a day, Fleets helped people feel more comfortable sharing personal and casual thoughts, opinions, and feelings. These are early findings from our tests and we’re excited to learn more about how Fleets are used by you. You can Fleet text, reactions to Tweets, photos or videos and customize your Fleets with various background and text options. To share a Tweet in a Fleet tap the “Share” icon at the bottom of the Tweet and then tap, “Share in Fleet.” Then, add what you think about it with some text or emojis. Soon, stickers and live broadcasting will be available in Fleets. Your followers can see your Fleets at the top of their home timeline. Anyone who can see your full profile can see your Fleets there too. Also, anyone who can send you a Direct Message can reply to your Fleets. If you want to reply to a Fleet, tap on it to send a Direct Message or emoji reaction to the author; replying or reacting to a Fleet starts a conversation in your Direct Messages. Fleet authors can see who views their Fleets, including accounts with protected Tweets, by clicking into their Fleets and tapping on the ‘Seen By’ text at the bottom. Learn more about how Fleets work here. Fleets will be updated over time with new features, based on your feedback. Just like Tweets, Fleets must follow the Twitter Rules. To report a Fleet, tap the ‘v’ icon at the top of a Fleet; you can also mute the account posting the Fleet from here. We’ll take action if a reported Tweet breaks our rules. If you Fleet a Tweet with a label or warning, it will carry over to Fleets. In some cases, you may need to tap through a warning before you’re able to view a Fleet. This format may sound familiar to you! We’ve learned that some people feel more comfortable joining conversations on Twitter with this ephemeral format, so what they’re saying lives just for a moment in time. In the coming days, everyone globally will have Fleets on Twitter for iOS and Android. Fleet or @ us with what you think!"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/improved-account-security-2020-us-election","date":"2020-01-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Improved account security during the 2020 US election","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice","date":"2020-01-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Your Tweet, your voice","text":"Twitter is where you go to talk about what’s happening. Over the years, photos, videos, gifs, and extra characters have allowed you to add your own flair and personality to your conversations. But sometimes 280 characters aren’t enough and some conversational nuances are lost in translation. So starting today, we’re testing a new feature that will add a more human touch to the way we use Twitter – your very own voice. Tweeting with your voice is not too different from Tweeting with text. To start, open the Tweet composer and tap the new icon with wavelengths. You’ll see your profile photo with the record button at the bottom – tap this to record your voice. Each voice Tweet captures up to 140 seconds of audio. Have more to say? Keep talking. Once you reach the time limit for a Tweet, a new voice Tweet starts automatically to create a thread. Once you’re done, tap the Done button to end your recording and go back to the composer screen to Tweet. People will see your voice Tweet appear on their timeline alongside other Tweets. To listen, tap the image. On iOS only, playback will start in a new window docked at the bottom of your timeline and you can listen as you scroll. You can also keep listening while doing other things on your phone or on the go. Creating voice Tweets will be available to a limited group of people on Twitter for iOS to start but in the coming weeks everyone on iOS should be able to Tweet with their voice. Everyone will be able to see (hear) them and reply. Learn more in our help center. There’s a lot that can be left unsaid or uninterpreted using text, so we hope voice Tweeting will create a more human experience for listeners and storytellers alike. Whether it’s #storytime about your encounter with wild geese in your neighborhood, a journalist sharing breaking news, or a first-hand account from a protest, we hope voice Tweeting gives you the ability to share your perspectives quickly and easily with your voice. We can’t wait to see how people will use this to make their voices heard and add to the public conversation."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/events/2020/kpoptwitter-rises-to-the-top-with-6-1-billion-global-tweets-in-2019","date":"2020-01-16T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events"],"title":"#KpopTwitter rises to the top with 6.1 billion global Tweets in 2019","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/covid19-vaccine","date":"2020-01-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["COVID-19","Company"],"title":"COVID-19: Our approach to misleading vaccine information","text":"Effective November 23, 2022, Twitter is no longer enforcing the COVID-19 misleading information policy. As the world continues to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for the global distribution of vaccines, people continue to turn to Twitter to discuss what’s happening and find the latest authoritative public health information. Earlier this year, we shared our approach around the conversation surrounding COVID-19 on Twitter and today we’re providing additional guidance on how we plan to address misleading information around COVID-19 vaccinations. Starting next week, we will prioritize the removal of the most harmful misleading information, and during the coming weeks, begin to label Tweets that contain potentially misleading information about the vaccines. Our expanded approach In the context of a global pandemic, vaccine misinformation presents a significant and growing public health challenge — and we all have a role to play. We are focused on mitigating misleading information that presents the biggest potential harm to people's health and wellbeing. Twitter has an important role to play as a place for good faith public debate and discussion around these critical public health matters. Under our current policy, we already require the removal of Tweets that include false or misleading information about: The nature of the virus, such as how it spreads within communities; The efficacy and/or safety of preventative measures, treatments, or other precautions to mitigate or treat the disease; Official regulations, restrictions, or exemptions pertaining to health advisories; and The prevalence or risk of infection or death. Moving forward and beginning next week, we are expanding the policy and may require people to remove Tweets which advance harmful false or misleading narratives about COVID-19 vaccinations, including: False claims that suggest immunizations and vaccines are used to intentionally cause harm to or control populations, including statements about vaccines that invoke a deliberate conspiracy; False claims which have been widely debunked about the adverse impacts or effects of receiving vaccinations; or False claims that COVID-19 is not real or not serious, and therefore that vaccinations are unnecessary. Starting in early 2021, we may label or place a warning on Tweets that advance unsubstantiated rumors, disputed claims, as well as incomplete or out-of-context information about vaccines. Tweets that are labeled under this expanded guidance may link to authoritative public health information or the Twitter Rules to provide people with additional context and authoritative information about COVID-19. What’s next Using a combination of technology and human review, we will begin enforcing this updated policy on December 21, and expanding our actions during the following weeks. We will enforce this policy in close consultation with local, national and global public health authorities around the world, and will strive to be iterative and transparent in our approach. We remained focused on helping people find credible health information, verifying public health experts, and updating our policies in an iterative and transparent approach."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-continuity-strategy-during-covid-19","date":"2020-01-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"An update on our continuity strategy during COVID-19","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/2020-election-news","date":"2020-01-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Elections","Company"],"title":"Helping you find accurate US Election News and Information","text":"Twitter wants to empower every eligible person to vote in the 2020 US election, and we’re focused on helping people register, better understand the voting process during COVID-19 including early voting options, and feel informed about the choices on their ballot. While nine in ten daily Twitter users say they plan to vote in the upcoming US elections, over half say they still need more information about the candidates on their ballot and how to vote in 2020.* As elections occur around the world, we’ve seen Twitter serve as the centralized hub for real-time political conversation, resources and breaking news. But we also know that at times it can be hard to quickly find the reliable news and accurate information people need in order to meet registration deadlines and participate confidently. That’s why we’ve banned political ads, expanded our policies around election misinformation, and are adding context to Tweets with labels for candidates, government and state-affiliated media accounts, and notices on Tweets with manipulated media. Trends now include additional context, Search results about voter registration lead with official sources, and people can report Tweets with deliberately misleading election information. With just under 50 days to go until election day and when many Americans are already facing registration deadlines and preparing for early voting, we’re launching our 2020 US election hub to make it simpler for people to find accurate information and resources on Twitter. People in the United States will see the hub at the top of their Explore tab which will include: News in both English and Spanish in the form of Twitter Moments created by reputable news outlets themselves, or by Twitter’s Curation team. Live streams of major election events like debates. A tool that shows candidates for US House, US Senate, and governor with an Election Label in your state. Localized news and resources by state. And in a first for Twitter, the hub will also include a series of voter education public service announcements (PSAs) created using information from nonpartisan government and voting advocacy organizations. The PSAs will run on Twitter all the way to election day, providing factual information on topics like voter registration, how to request an absentee ballot, and tips on staying healthy while voting during the pandemic. The first PSA is already live here in English and Spanish, and if people want to subscribe to this series, they can Like or Retweet this Tweet in order to receive them via in-app notifications.

As we experience the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, talking openly about our mental health concerns can build empathy and respect. Throughout the month of May, we worked with over 60 of our mental health partners around the world to raise awareness and help break the stigma associated with mental health. Utilizing the hashtags #LetsTalk and #TogetherWeCan, our partners inspired a series of honest, global mental health conversations around the anxiety and stress that we — our families, peers, educators, students, and vulnerable groups — are experiencing together. The hashtags and bespoke emoji was translated into over 30 languages and activated in over 30 different countries during the month of May. We saw countless creative uses of Twitter for #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek and #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth including live Twitter Q+As with mental health organizations, people sharing mental health tips and resources and people opening up about their individual mental health concerns. Through these trusted partnerships, we encouraged people to see Twitter as a place to talk about their mental health — sharing their experiences and helping others understand how different cultures and communities respond to these challenges. Bringing the conversation together Our mental health emoji and hashtags were utilized throughout the month of May to integrate and amplify the global conversation. They were shared almost 170,000 times on the service — promoting access to mental health resources from over 70 global mental health organizations. The hashtags #MentalHealth; #MentalHealthMonth; #LetsTalk and #TogetherWeCan combined to reach over half a million uses throughout the month, bringing the global conversation together to raise awareness and normalize discussion around mental health. Along with these important and real on-service mental health conversations with our partners and the bespoke emoji launches across the world, we donated Ads for Good grants for mental health partners to amplify their messages and campaigns over the month of May. APAC On May 4th, our partners Samaritans of Thailand (@Samaritans_Thai) launched an Ask Me Anything on-service Q+A, where people on Twitter had the opportunity to ask questions about their mental health stresses and have them answered and supported by @Samaritans_Thai experts. The Q+A was brought together on the service using the hashtag #AskSamaritansTH and the bespoke mental health hashtags #UsapTayo and #คุยกันได้ทุกเรื่อง — all amplified through Twitter’s @NonProfits account to further promote the insights and resources published throughout the on-service Q+A. Key themes discussed throughout included how to deal with feelings of guilt, how to manage social anxieties, and where to go to for support: North America On May 5th, our Mental Health America partners took to Twitter to answer frequently asked questions related to COVID-19 mental health challenges and ways to cope - bringing the conversation together on the service through the hashtags #LetsTalk and #TogetherWeCan. This activation was amplified live via a thread through Twitter’s @NonProfits account. This thread shows the many resources and support available for people who are feeling anxious and unnerved through stressful times in their lives. This conversation on Twitter also breaks down stigmas associated with speaking about mental health areas like mindfulness and meditation, mental health tools, finding gratitude and joy in daily routines, as well as where to find credible information regarding COVID-19. On May 7th — Child Youth & Mental Health Day — our partners in Canada @KidsHelpPhone promoted their key resources on how to support young people throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. LATAM Our partner Centro de Valorização da Vida (@CVVoficial) shared mental health resources and encouraged people on Twitter to have honest conversations about the mental health stresses caused by the global pandemic. Using the hashtags #JuntosPodemos and #VamosConversar they invited people to connect with their services and break the stigma around mental health. Their tweets were amplified through Twitter’s @NonProfits account. Our partner in Colombia, @MutanteOrg also shared some key mental health resources and encouraged people to engage in open conversations about their mental health. With the hashtag #HablemosDeSaludMental, @MutanteOrg also invited psychologists to engage in and promote deep thinking around the importance of good mental health. EMEA Our partner Mental Health Europe (@MHESME) launched their on-service Q+A on the 6th of May, and this @MHESME thread was also amplified via Twitter @NonProfits.Topics discussed included: utilizing social media in positive ways, supporting healthcare workers, being there for family and friends during COVID-19, and managing mental health triggers: Resources Mental health awareness and treatment is a critical global issue, and it’s important to capture tools that we can turn to over time. Via our Twitter @NonProfits account, we developed a Twitter List of our mental health partner profiles and resources for people to access as needed on the service. Through our @Policy account, we created a #LetsTalk Moment to showcase the reach and engagement that on-service conversations can enable through global partners, which inspire us to express our real and unique challenges and address mental health together. WHO As #MentalHealthAwareness month came to a close, the WHO answered some frequently asked questions and shared toolkits through their @WHO Twitter profile to address the stresses and anxieties that people continue to face through the COVID-19 pandemic. We amplified this important resource via our @Policy handle. Some key areas of focus in this FAQ conversation were: techniques in managing stress, how to manage the stress associated with seeing constant COVID-19 media reports, and advice for parents and children who are spending much more time at home due to the pandemic. By sparking conversations with local organizations and showcasing innovative ways partners utilize the service, our goal was to provide an interconnected space to raise diverse perspectives and resources to confront the mental health effects of COVID-19. We continue to work in collaboration with our mental health partners around the world, in keeping the #MentalHeath conversation alive and engaged on Twitter."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/expanding-our-commitment-to-brand-safety","date":"2020-01-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Ads","Brands","Health","Partnerships","Transparency","Product"],"title":"Expanding our commitment to brand safety","text":"Twitter’s purpose is to serve the public conversation and we are committed to creating a healthy environment where everyone, including advertisers, can participate and engage safely. We know there is a lot of work to be done to achieve this, and we are actively working with key industry partners to advance brand safety as a central component of the advertising and measurement solutions on Twitter. Here’s a look at our areas of focus ahead of 2021: Doubling down on third-party brand safety measurement solutions. Today, we're excited to announce that we've selected DoubleVerify (DV) and Integral Ad Science (IAS) to be Twitter's preferred partners for providing independent reporting on the context in which ads appear on Twitter. We see this as an opportunity to build solutions that will give advertisers a better understanding of the types of content that appear adjacent to their ads, helping them make informed decisions to reach their marketing goals. These solutions will complement our existing third-party viewability measurement solutions with DV and IAS. Over the past five months, we’ve engaged in a rigorous process to select partners from a slate of third-party measurement vendors. We are excited to make this announcement, knowing that there has never been a third-party brand safety solution built to measure for adjacency to brand unsafe content in an environment like Twitter, which is both real-time and dynamic. We look forward to partnering with both DV and IAS to create custom solutions for our unique platform and we intend to start testing solutions in early 2021. Measuring brand safety and suitability across in-feed environments is critically important for brands. DV is ready to tackle this challenge by leveraging our technology and expertise to evaluate the context of real-time, user-generated content. We are pleased to partner with Twitter to ensure a brand safe and suitable advertising environment on their platform. Mark Zagorski CEO at DoubleVerify IAS is excited to partner with Twitter to pioneer in-feed brand safety and suitability solutions that will help advertisers navigate this dynamic social environment. Measurement is more critical than ever as marketers seek even greater transparency for their social media spend, and together with Twitter we can offer advertisers the trusted solutions they need. Lisa Utzschneider CEO at Integral Ad Science Our commitment to MRC accreditation. Last week, we also shared our commitment to undergo the accreditation process across all four of the Media Ratings Council’s offered Accreditation Services: Viewability, Sophisticated Invalid Traffic Filtration, Audience Measurement, and Brand Safety. We will be prioritizing the Brand Safety audit first, and have already started the proposal process for this accreditation. We believe that all four accreditations are critical in demonstrating our enduring commitment to transparency and are pleased to be in a position to expand on and sustain this collaborative process. We look forward to working with the MRC and further aligning on scope, sequencing, and timing. Continued partnership with industry leaders. Twitter is an active and founding member of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). In conjunction with our ongoing efforts to better align our brand safety solutions with GARM’s principles, we support DV and IAS in their efforts to adapt their current categorization frameworks to better map to the harmful monetized content categories identified by the GARM, the 4A’s APB, and the ANA. We will continue to partner with industry leaders to define and refine the work that is needed to keep platforms safe for advertisers. Unlocking research to learn more. Twitter’s personalized feed-based environment makes content adjacency inherently unique when considering brand safety questions. It is critical to understand where associations occur, where they don't, and how those associations affect brands as we continue to invest in this area. Early research done by Twitter’s data science teams indicates that on our platform, adjacency between ads and divisive content has not yet been found to affect brand favorability. Currently, we are working on additional research to gain more knowledge and insight around the impact of adjacency on Twitter ads. We look forward to incorporating these findings into our ongoing work with DV and IAS and using it to inform how we build and iterate on our advertising products. Marching towards 2021. We are excited to build on the existing momentum with our brand safety partners and to develop innovative solutions for our customers that help push our industry forward. We will continue to be transparent in all our efforts and keep you updated along the way. Most importantly, we are ready to do the work. Study Methodology: We analyzed Twitter Brand Survey data from April to July 2020, which included 50,000 respondents who were exposed to 1,200 Promoted Tweets. For the purposes of this study, we used a broad definition of divisive content, inclusive of 11 content categories including Politics, Social Movements, Ongoing News and Protests. For the purposes of this study, adjacency was defined broadly as any of the two Tweets above and the two Tweets below each of the Promoted Tweets and we analyzed results based on content both 1 and 2 spots away from ads. Analysis was performed both in aggregate and specific to each of the 11 categories of divisive content to determine if adjacency to certain types of divisiveness alter people’s opinion of adjacent brands. Results showed no evidence of any effect on brand favorability when ads were adjacent to any of the studied categories of divisive content, regardless of the distance of the adjacency."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/why-business-iq-is-not-enough-in-the-era-of-the-relationship-economy","date":"2020-01-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Social Listening","Socialdata","Social Media","Social Intelligence","Insights"],"title":"Why business IQ is not enough in the era of the relationship economy","text":"Originally coined in the 1960’s, the term “emotional intelligence” (EQ) hit the mainstream when it became the topic (and title) of a 1995 best selling book by author and science journalist David Goleman. Goleman’s in-depth review of research on the human brain and human behavior led him to the conclusion that cognitive intelligence alone is not a reliable predictor of future success in life and business. Rather it is emotional intelligence that plays a major role in determining success in life.1 This (at the time) relatively new way of looking at people and success has since gained wide acceptance and EQ has become highly valued within the workplace and beyond. Twenty-five years later, it’s hard not to draw parallels with a shift happening in the business world. Thanks to technology and global connectivity, cultural, language and geographic barriers to information flow and communication have all but disappeared. That’s great news for consumers as it means more choice than ever before. But for businesses it means competition is at an all-time high and relying on status quo business IQ – price, product and distribution - is no longer enough. Welcome to the relationship economy - where customer experiences and brand loyalty (business EQ) reign supreme. As Forrester puts it, “Competitive strategy can no longer rely on strength of manufacturing, distribution, or information. It’s the Age of Customer and Forrester’s data proves that the right Customer Experience is the only way to significantly differentiate”.2 So, what does EQ mean when it comes to business? Much like the original ideas espoused by Goleman, businesses would do well to better understand the feelings, motivations and emotions of their customers and then use that insight to guide their actions. For their part, customers want more than a transaction. They are looking for everything you would expect from a relationship - alignment of values, trust, personalization, exceptional service and open dialogue. And, for better or worse, consumers today are less loyal and quick to switch should the relationship sour. According to the American Express 2017 Customer Service Barometer, more than half of Americans have scrapped a planned purchase or transaction because of bad service, and 33 percent say they’ll consider switching companies after just a single instance of poor service. If business EQ is the secret ingredient of meaningful, lasting and mutually beneficial relationships, it’s critical that businesses be attuned to their customers by gathering emotional intelligence in real-time, continuously. They need to be able to pick up signals before things turn bad or identify things that work well and do more of them. There is one place where consumers are freely sharing their emotions, unprompted, in the moment. Every minute of every day, people around the world are sharing their thoughts, experiences and opinions as they happen on Twitter. Social listening helps tap into these insights, allowing businesses to sharpen their customer EQ and act in the best interest of the relationship.

On October 17, Kiwis will go to the polls to have their say in the 2020 New Zealand General Election and on two referendums. The campaign period might look a little different this year due to COVID-19, but one thing has remained the same — the election conversation is happening on Twitter. Our research indicates that Kiwis use Twitter to stay connected and get informed, with 1 in 3 Twitter users in New Zealand saying it's their main source of news on politics*. During campaigning, Twitter has lit up with conversation about candidates, policies, and the issues that matter the most to New Zealanders. Here's everything you need to know about the #NZElection2020 conversation on Twitter: Special election emoji We’ve launched a Twitter emoji featuring one very civically engaged kiwi bird to add some colour to your election Tweets. It will appear when you Tweet with any of the following hashtags. #nzpol #Decision20 #NZElection2020 #YourVote2020 Find key information at Twitter’s dedicated Event page Twitter’s one-stop shop Event page has all the key information New Zealanders need to know ahead of polling day. Voters at home and abroad can find credible information on the topics they care about, including candidates, how to enrol and vote, and what key policies are being discussed. Protecting the integrity of the New Zealand Election on Twitter In New Zealand and around the world, Twitter has consistently worked to protect the public conversation around elections — the cornerstone of our democracies. Our expanded Civic Integrity Policy, Political Content Policy, and overarching Twitter Rules are in place to protect the election conversation as New Zealanders express their critical rights this October. We’ve connected with political parties to provide an overview of our election policies and our work around civic integrity, as well as sharing practical tips for staying safe on Twitter. We have also engaged with the parties and the New Zealand Electoral Commission (@ElectoralCommNZ) to ensure the right support channels are in place to escalate concerns and report any violations of our Rules or policies. Our cross-functional elections team We have formed a high-level internal group to lead our election integrity work throughout the election period. The group consists of several of the company’s top trust and safety experts and members from our site integrity, legal, data science investigation, and public policy teams. This blend of perspectives, expertise, and backgrounds is a critical component of maintaining the health of the conversation on our service. Fostering civic engagement and the election conversation Twitter is the place where people go to see what’s happening during an election, participate in the conversation, and join the online campaign trail. Kiwis have turned to Twitter to share their early voting experiences Keep up to date with political parties, candidates, and civil society The final leaders’ debate will be broadcast live on Twitter over at @1NewsNZ, Thursday, October 15 at 7:00pm NZDT (5:00pm AEDT).

How do social listening tools help you deliver more human, empathetic care? What’s the biggest mistake organizations are making when it comes to leveraging data that can improve customer experience? Twitter Official Data Partner Sprinklr and Twitter hosted experts in CX and customer service to discuss these questions and explore topics such as: Why going off script is necessary to deliver truly human care How AI and automation can scale customer care (without bots taking the “human” out of it) What role social listening tools can play in modern customer care Practical next steps to get started on improving your CX View the webinar for a rich discussion with Maureen Blandford, Tech Marketing & Transformation Leader; Tracey Finlay, Leadership, Tech Marketing & Transformation Leader; Joe Rice, Data & Enterprise Solutions at Twitter; and Jen Brown, Director of Marketing, Sprinklr. Here are some highlights: What factors are causing brands issues with CX? We are all tired of the word ‘transformation,’ but it’s still the reality. I talk about legacy mountains in organizations; it’s still a huge obstacle. Legacy structures, processes, and mindsets, it’s very difficult for a functional leader to overcome those without the C-suite on board. We still have moats and drawbridges with how functions are communicating with each other; we’re not communicating very well. Maureen Blandford What hinders companies from leveraging the knowledge customer care has? Too often people see the contact center as the lowest of the low. When I talk to agents, they know more about what the customers want than the customers do. They have the answers. But organizations don’t trust their agents to intuitively know what is right for the customer. Yet, 99 percent of the time, they do. They just need to be trusted. Get a big bunch of customer-facing people in a room for three hours and ask them: What do customers do that is really annoying? They will list off everything and give you an amazing, low-cost roadmap of stuff you can fix right away. And it makes your customer-facing teams feel listened to. Tracey Finlay How do you leverage social insights to make better CX decisions? Organizations have focused too much on quantitative social insights (impressions, engagement, reach) which aren’t business outcomes, and have underutilized and probably underappreciated the qualitative nature of Twitter data. This is in my opinion more insightful and more powerful as it's feedback that’s emotive, unprompted, and in the moment. Twitter is now 14 years old and I’m still surprised by the number of organizations that don’t have any processes or tools like Sprinklr to engage and manage their social engagement and therefore lots of Tweets and DMs go unanswered. Twitter is public by nature and so presents a great opportunity to humanize your brand and show you care.

It’s been just over a week since Election Day in the US and the culmination of an unprecedented voting period that resulted in the highest voter turnout rate in 50 years. While we’re still seeing record levels of election-related conversation on Twitter and our teams continue to actively enforce our rules to protect the integrity of this public conversation, we want to provide an update about this ongoing work. We also want to be very clear that we do not see our job as done — our work here continues and our teams are learning and improving how we address these challenges. We’ll be sharing a comprehensive report on the election early next year. In the months leading up to Election Day, we announced a set of policy, enforcement and product changes to add context, encourage thoughtful consideration, and reduce the potential for misleading information to spread on Twitter. Here’s what we’ve learned about the impact of those changes so far, and how we plan to adapt based on those findings: Labels, warnings, and prebunks More than a year ago, the public told us they wanted Twitter to offer context on misleading information. This is the exact approach we’ve implemented on Tweets about COVID-19, synthetic and manipulated media, and the 2020 US election that could contribute to offline harm. We continue to apply labels to add context and limit the risk of harmful election misinformation spreading without important context. Below are some key statistics about the labels, warnings, and additional restrictions we applied to Tweets that included potentially misleading information about the US Election from October 27 to November 11: Approximately 300,000 Tweets have been labeled under our Civic Integrity Policy for content that was disputed and potentially misleading. These represent 0.2% of all US election-related Tweets sent during this time period. 456 of those Tweets were also covered by a warning message and had engagement features limited (Tweets could be Quote Tweeted but not Retweeted, replied to or liked). Approximately 74% of the people who viewed those Tweets saw them after we applied a label or warning message. We saw an estimated 29% decrease in Quote Tweets of these labeled Tweets due in part to a prompt that warned people prior to sharing. We also got ahead of potentially misleading information by showing everyone on Twitter in the US a series of pre-bunk prompts. These prompts, which were seen 389 million times, appeared in people’s home timelines and in Search, and reminded people that election results were likely to be delayed, and that voting by mail is safe and legitimate. These enforcement actions remain part of our continued strategy to add context and limit the spread of misleading information about election processes around the world on Twitter. Product changes In the weeks leading up to and during election week, we implemented significant product changes intended to increase context and encourage more thoughtful consideration before Tweets are amplified. Starting today, we are reverting some of these changes and providing more detail on the impact they had. Encouraging Quote Tweets We encouraged people to add their own commentary when amplifying content by prompting Quote Tweets instead of Retweets. This change introduced some friction, and gave people an extra moment to consider why and what they were adding to the conversation. Since making this change, we observed a 23% decrease in Retweets and a 26% increase in Quote Tweets, but on a net basis the overall number of Retweets and Quote Tweets combined decreased by 20%. In short, this change slowed the spread of misleading information by virtue of an overall reduction in the amount of sharing on the service. We are taking more time to study and fully understand the impact of this change and are leaving it in-place for now. Updated on December 16, 2020: We’ll no longer be prompting Quote Tweets, and are re-enabling the standard Retweet behavior. We hoped this change would encourage thoughtful amplification and also increase the likelihood that people would add their own thoughts, reactions and perspectives to the conversation. However, we observed that prompting Quote Tweets didn’t appear to increase context: 45% of additional Quote Tweets included just a single word and 70% contained less than 25 characters. Removing Tweet recommendations in Home Timeline & Notifications We stopped providing “liked by” and “followed by” Tweet recommendations from accounts you don’t follow in the Home Timeline and through notifications. While we had initially hoped that this would help reduce the potential for misleading information to spread on our service, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in misinformation prevalence as a result of this change (nor any meaningful reduction in abuse reports). Instead, we found that pausing these recommendations prevented many people from discovering new conversations and accounts to follow. As of today, we are reverting this change. Our goal is to eventually replace these “liked by” and “followed by” recommendations with ones that are based on the Topics you follow or Topics we think you might like. We believe this will provide you greater control to tell us what you are and aren’t interested in, which will make our recommendations more relevant to you. Also, we don’t believe the “Like” button provides sufficient, thoughtful consideration prior to amplifying Tweets. We’ve grown our coverage of Topics recommendations significantly in the last year, with now more than 5,000 Topics available, and hope to be able to complete this transition soon. Required context before showing Trends in “For You” We only showed Trends in “For You” that had added context, meaning our team added a description, representative Tweet, or article to help people more quickly gain an informed understanding of high volume public conversation. While we saw a significant reduction in reports (on Trends, and Tweets within Trends result pages) as a result of this change, we also recognized that it placed a significant limitation on the number and breadth of Trends that we could show people, making “For You” less relevant for many people’s interests. Moving forward, we’ll continue to prioritize reviewing and adding context to as many Trends as possible, but won’t make this a requirement before a Trend can appear in “For You.” Our goal is to help people see what’s happening, while ensuring that potentially misleading trends are presented with context. Next steps We remain vigilant and will continue working to protect the integrity of the election conversation on Twitter. As we’ve done for many elections around the world, we will produce a longer-form retrospective of all of our work around the 2020 US Election in early 2021. We will continue to research, question, and change features that may incentivize or encourage behaviors on Twitter that negatively affect the health of the public conversation.

The account sets we’re publishing to the archive today include three distinct operations that we have attributed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), Russia, and Turkey respectively. Every account and piece of content associated with these operations has been permanently removed from the service. In addition, we have shared relevant data from this disclosure with two leading research partners: Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) and Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO). In all instances, accounts were suspended for various violations of our platform manipulation policies. People’s Republic of China (PRC) While this network is new, the technical links we used to identify the activity and attribute it to the PRC remain consistent with activity we initially identified and disclosed in August 2019. Our proactive removal of this network from Twitter is a direct result of the technical efforts we instituted after thoroughly studying and investigating past coordinated information operations from the PRC. Today’s PRC disclosure relates to two interconnected sets of accounts: 23,750 accounts that comprise the core of the network, e.g. the highly engaged core network. Approximately 150,000 accounts that were designed to boost this content, e.g. the amplifiers. Based on feedback from researchers on our prior disclosures that we need to better refine the disclosure process to enable efficient investigation of the core activity, we have not included the 150,000 amplifier accounts in the public archive. Despite the volume, the core 23,750 accounts we are publishing to the archive were largely caught early and failed to achieve considerable traction on the service, typically holding low follower accounts and low engagement. Of the approximately 150,000 amplifier accounts, the majority had little to no follower counts either and were strategically designed to artificially inflate impression metrics and engage with the core accounts. In general, this entire network was involved in a range of manipulative and coordinated activities. They were Tweeting predominantly in Chinese languages and spreading geopolitical narratives favorable to the Communist Party of China (CCP), while continuing to push deceptive narratives about the political dynamics in Hong Kong. Russia Aided in part by useful information sharing from external researchers and our peer companies, we investigated accounts associated with Current Policy, a media website engaging in state-backed political propaganda within Russia. A network of accounts related to this media operation was suspended for violations of our platform manipulation policy, specifically cross-posting and amplifying content in an inauthentic, coordinated manner for political ends. Activities included promoting the United Russia party and attacking political dissidents. We’re disclosing all 1,152 accounts and associated media to our public archive today. Turkey Detected in early 2020, this network of accounts was employing coordinated inauthentic activity, which was primarily targeted at domestic audiences within Turkey. Based on our analysis of the network’s technical indicators and account behaviors, the collection of fake and compromised accounts was being used to amplify political narratives favorable to the AK Parti, and demonstrated strong support for President Erdogan. We’re disclosing 7,340 accounts to the archive today. Technical signals point to the network being associated with the youth wing of the party and a centralized network that maintained a significant number of compromised accounts. As a result, the network we’re disclosing today includes several compromised accounts associated with organizations critical of President Erdogan and the Turkish Government. These compromised accounts have been repeated targets of account hacking and takeover efforts by the state actors identified above. The broader network was also used for commercial activities, such as cryptocurrency-related spam. Next steps for this work Ultimately our goal is to serve the public conversation, remove bad faith actors, and to advance public understanding of these critical topics. In the future we’re going to: Offer more clarity in the public archive around impression counts and attempt to further measure the tangible impact of information operations on the public conversation. Continue to formalize our academic partnerships to ensure they’re globally diverse and advancing public understanding of these issues. Host an online conference later in the summer to bring experts, industry, and government together to discuss opportunities for further collaboration. Our Site Integrity efforts represent some of the most critical work we do at Twitter to protect the public conversation.

Sometimes people are more comfortable talking about what's happening when they can choose who can reply. We’ve seen people use these settings to have conversations that weren't really possible before. Starting today, everyone will be able to use these settings so unwanted replies don’t get in the way of meaningful conversations. Here’s how it works. Before you Tweet, choose who can reply with three options: 1) everyone (standard Twitter, and the default setting), 2) only people you follow, or 3) only people you mention. Tweets with the latter two settings will be labeled and the reply icon will be grayed out for people who can’t reply. People who can’t reply will still be able to view, Retweet, Retweet with Comment, share, and like these Tweets. Since we started testing this in May, people have used it to host interviews and panels, share what’s on their mind, and make announcements. We’ve learned a lot from usage, feedback interviews, and surveys. These settings help some people feel safer and could lead to more meaningful conversations, while still allowing people to see different points of view. Here’s more on what people shared with us. ⬇️ These settings help some people feel safer. People tell us they feel more comfortable Tweeting and more protected from spam and abuse. Problematic repliers aren't finding another way – these settings prevented an average of three potentially abusive replies while only adding one potentially abusive Retweet with Comment. And, we didn’t see any uptick in unwanted Direct Messages. People who face abuse find these settings helpful – those who have submitted abuse reports are 3x more likely to use these settings. It’s a new method to block out noise – 60% of people who used this during the test didn’t use Mute or Block. The change could lead to more meaningful conversations on Twitter. People are sharing more of their thoughts – Tweets using these settings about topics like Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 are on average longer than those that don’t use these settings. Some people use these settings to have more sensitive conversations about politics and social issues. Those with a lot of followers use these settings to share more feelings, opinions, and personal news. People still can see various points of view. Research shows people understand replies are limited on these Tweets. People more frequently look for additional commentary when replies are limited – the new Retweets with Comments timeline is visited 4x more often on Tweets using these settings. Differing views can still be shared with Retweets with Comments, which sometimes reach a larger audience than the original Tweet. Several times, we saw more Likes and views on a Retweet with Comment than on the original Tweet, even though the original Tweet author had more followers. Twitter serves the public conversation, so it’s important for people to be able to see different perspectives. We’ll keep working on making it easier for people to find the entire discussion through Retweets with Comments. Also, we’re trying out a new label to make it more obvious when these conversation settings are used. We’ll continue to update these Tweet settings based on your feedback. In the next few months we’re planning to add an option to invite more people to the conversation after it starts, clear notifications for when you’re invited to join a conversation using these settings, and more ways to see the entire discussion. Everyone can now use these settings on Twitter for iOS and Android as well as twitter.com.

The initiative will be led by Emeritus Professor Kevin Clements (@kpclements) and lead researcher Sanjana Hattotuwa (@sanjanah). NCPACS was established in 2009 as New Zealand’s first Centre to combine global interdisciplinary expertise on the issues of development, peace-building, and conflict transformation. Located within the University of Otago’s (@otago) Division of Humanities, it has since made significant contributions to emergent research areas and holds regular conferences promoting research and intercommunity dialogue. In the aftermath of the horrific Christchurch terror attacks on 15 March 2019, Twitter and NCPACS embarked on a joint research project aimed at analysing the ways in which Twitter and social media more broadly was used for both positive and negative purposes. “The project is a wonderful example of the way in which Twitter is working with governments, other companies and organisations, to ensure that its service is not abused by those promoting polarisation, hate language, and violence,” said Emeritus Professor Kevin Clements, former Foundation Chair of Peace and Conflict Studies, Founding Director of the NCPACS, and Secretary General of the International Peace Research Association. “While the initial prompt for this joint research project came from the 15 March 2019 Christchurch massacre, there have been numerous examples of digitally amplified polarisation around the world. The challenge is how to understand the ways in which social media can be used to promote tolerance and inclusion instead of division and exclusion. “Under the aegis of Twitter’s global #DataforGood initiative, NCPACS received a data grant that enables our Centre and our dedicated researchers to explore in depth the events, conversations, and topics on Twitter with the hope and expectation that our work may inform strong policy outcomes, inspire others who are tackling similar issues around the world, and promote the place and role for new partnerships as we work together to solve the rapidly evolving challenges of polarised communities and identities offline and online.” Lead researcher and Ph.D. candidate at the NCPACS, Sanjana Hattotuwa, has extensive experience living in and responding to violent conflict and has made significant studies of social media to determine how online communications activate positive and negative responses from a wider public. He has done this work in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and after the Christchurch massacre in 2019, in New Zealand. “This research is extremely important in helping us understand the ways in which narratives are produced, promoted and engaged with to generate or stymie altruistic behaviour,” Mr Hattotuwa explained. Mr. Hattotuwa conducted preliminary research just a week after the Christchurch massacre. By using data generated from tens of thousands of public Tweets anchored to the violence, he discovered a local and global outpouring of support for victims, solidarity with the citizens of New Zealand, the affirmation of democratic ideals, pushback against terrorism, and unequivocal condemnation of the perpetrator. “I was surprised by the volume of Tweets with just five hashtags (#christchurchmosqueshooting, #christchurchshooting, #christchurchterroristattack, #newzealandterroristattack and #christchurch) generating around 85,000 Tweets in the immediate 24-hour period after the attack. Another two hashtags pegged to the number of victims at the time (#49lives) and a message of solidarity (#theyareus) emerged the day after, generating 37,000 more Tweets. “In Urdu and Hindi, from Pakistan to India, as well as the New Zealand Prime Minister’s own responses on Twitter in English, the most viral Tweets at the time featured content and conversations condemning the massacre” noted Mr. Hattotuwa. “A Tweet by Prime Minister Jacinda Arden (@jacindaardern) was liked over 135,000 times and Retweeted over 38,000 times just five days after the massacre.” We are optimistic the research will not only demonstrate key dynamics of different communication patterns prior to the Christchurch massacre, but will also enable us to better understand ways in which differences get turned into polarised, and ultimately, toxic divisions. This will be helpful for all those involved in the Christchurch Call, as well as other forums studying these topics. We believe in the power of the public conversation to heal wounds and to build enduring, peaceful communities. In tandem with our multilateral efforts with industry and as signatories to the Christchurch Call to Action, we’ve been resolutely focused on the ways Twitter can tackle extremism while promoting dialogue and inter-community understanding. Our goal is to harness the unique power of our service by providing data that empowers research, and hopefully gain a better understanding of the risks and the opportunities available through fostering an open, public conversation. Under the academic leadership of the University of Otago, Emeritus Professor Kevin Clements, and Sanjana Hattotuwa, we want to listen, learn, and put their insights into action.

This year, the United States Census Bureau will conduct its decennial Census, deploying resources across the country to ensure an accurate count of people living in the US. Statistics gathered by the Census are used to determine the number of seats each state holds in the U.S. House of Representatives and inform how state, local, and federal lawmakers will allocate billions of dollars in funds to local communities each year for the next decade. Direct engagement with the Census Bureau and key stakeholders Our outreach and close partnership with Census officials has driven our approach to keeping the conversation healthy. We partnered with the US Census Bureau in November 2019 to host a training at TwitterDC with more than 30 civil society partners in attendance that learned about Twitter's civic integrity policies and best practice content tactics. We’ve hosted a multitude of similar trainings and educational sessions for nonprofit organizations that will deploy resources to support the Census. The Census Bureau is glad to have the help of our 2020 Census partners and technology platforms in the fight against misinformation and disinformation. There's still work to be done and we need everyone's help in reporting content intended to affect the accuracy and completeness of the count. Ron Jarmin US Census Bureau Deputy Director and COO Twitter is also a founding member of the Civic Alliance, a nonpartisan group of businesses working together to increase civic involvement. The coalition will specifically focus on supporting participation in the Census. Here’s what we’re doing to protect the Twitter conversation related to the #2020Census: Dedicated Census search prompt We’ve partnered with the US Census Bureau to launch a new tool so when someone searches for certain keywords associated with the Census, a prompt will direct individuals to the official Census site: https://2020Census.gov. This website provides clear information on the 2020 Census, how to participate, and how the Census process will safeguard individual privacy and security. This search prompt is available on iOS, Android, and mobile.twitter.com in the United States. This is an expansion of our #KnowTheFacts prompt, which we specifically put in place for the public to find clear, credible information on critical issues. As of March 19, the search prompt is available in English, Spanish, and 11 additional languages including: Chinese (simplified), Vietnamese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, Tagalog, Polish, French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Japanese. Expanding policy enforcement to protect the Census conversation Additionally, as part of our company-wide efforts to fight misinformation regarding participation in civic events, we’re applying our existing election integrity policy to Census-related content to make certain the Census conversation on Twitter remains healthy. Ahead of key moments in the 2020 US election, we’ve turned on a tool that enables people to report misleading information about how to participate in an election or other civic event. It is against the Twitter Rules to share false or misleading information about how to participate in an election or other civic event. This tool helps us identify and remove misinformation that could suppress turnout for events such as the US Census and elections around the globe. For updates on this work, follow @TwitterGov and @Policy.

Now, 16 years on, we are delighted to be working with partners all over the world to mark #SaferInternetDay2020 and play our part in shaping a better internet for all. Over the past 12 months, we have made substantial strides in tackling abusive content on our service globally. There will always be more to do, but we have made meaningful progress. Key highlights include: More than 1 in 2 of Tweets we take action on for abuse are now proactively surfaced using technology, rather than relying on reports to Twitter - this compares to 1 in 5 tweets in 2018; We have seen a 105% increase in accounts actioned by Twitter (locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules); In November 2019, we launched the option globally for users to hide replies to their Tweets — now anyone can choose to hide replies to their Tweets; In December 2019, we expanded and diversified our Trust and Safety Council, which brings together experts and organizations from around the world to help advise us as we develop our products, programs and the Twitter Rules; Last Tuesday, we announced a new rule to address synthetic & manipulated media. From 5 March, we will start labeling Tweets if we believe that media shared within them have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated. Labels will link to a Twitter moment to provide additional context from reputable sources on the content in question. Making Twitter safer is not a job we can do alone — which is why it’s so important to us, to participate in #SaferInternetDay2020. Across the world today and throughout February, we are working with our network of safety partners to amplify their guidance, provide Ads for Good grants to support their campaigns, and collaborating on what we can all do create a better Internet. We are running safety training and delivering presentations on our work across 4 continents, and participating in events globally to commemorate the day. In Mexico City, we will be delivering a safety training for the Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists. In India, we will be addressing e-Raksha: Cybercrime Against Children with the CyberPeace Foundation & UNICEF. At our HQ in San Francisco, we will be conducting a safety workshop for high school students from #ICANHELP (@icanhelp), and partnering with Common Sense (@commonsense) to deliver digital citizenship training to various nonprofits serving youth and families. We will also be opening our event space to 50 Digital Learning facilitators from San Francisco Unified School District (@SFUSDdot), and sharing Twitter educator and safety best practices. Here in Europe, we will be running a training at the Helsinki Central Library Oodi; participating in Better Internet for Kids meeting organised by the European Commission in Brussels, and running an event to promote a safer internet for all citizens, especially young people, with our partners Webwise at our international HQ in Dublin. In the UK - working with @ArtHouse, we created four short videos about the range of safety tools available on Twitter, with 4 online leaders; Habiba da Silva, Dina Tokio, Hannah Witton, Alexander Leon. Our aim is to reach a wider audience with engaging content about these individuals’ own experiences on the service, and the safety tools they use. We are encouraging conversations with a special emoji for the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2020, available in eighteen languages to encourage conversations around a safer internet. Throughout 2020, we will continue to support our safety partners, and work to ensure the public conversation on Twitter is healthy, open, and safe."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/inclusion-and-diversity-report-q4-2020-leadership-transparency-and-accountability","date":"2020-01-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Diversity","#UntilWeAllBelong","Company"],"title":"Inclusion & Diversity Q4 2020: Leadership, transparency & accountability","text":"As 2020 comes to a close, we’ll see a proliferation of year-in-review pieces highlighting how companies have navigated a remarkably unprecedented year. At Twitter, we’re proud of how we have continuously pivoted, first to protect and support employees during a global pandemic, and next by doubling down on our commitment to understanding and combating systemic racism and anti-Blackness in the United States and around the world. But it would be a disservice to all of the hard work that’s occurred across our business to solely focus on the curveballs the year has thrown us. At the beginning of the year we unveiled a bold new vision for 2025 and our initial plan for the hard work required to drive progress across the company. I’m proud to say that despite the unpredictable nature of 2020, we’ve still made meaningful progress against these goals, and I want to tell you about it. First, a quick refresher on the vision we set forth early this year: by 2025, at least half of our global workforce will be women, and at least a quarter of our US workforce will be underrepresented minorities. Check out our Q4 diversity numbers to see the steady progress we’ve made in 2020. Along with that bold vision, as a company we doubled down on deeper commitments across leadership, transparency, and accountability — all to drive progress along our journey to be the world’s most diverse and inclusive tech company. Here are a few highlights from our work across the company: Accountability Accountability starts at the top. So in addition to the company-wide goals set for workforce representation, we worked with our executive team to clearly define their proportional share of responsibility for driving progress, taking into account the size of the businesses they lead, their open headcount, projected pace of hiring, and average attrition rates. In order for our approach to work, every employee at Twitter needs to be aligned on what we’re trying to achieve — not just the executive team. That’s why in 2019 we created an internal diversity dashboard so any Tweep can track in real time how we’re doing against our workforce representation goals by gender (global) and race/ethnicity (US), with filters for leadership and technical/nontechnical roles — and hold us accountable. We recently launched version 3.0 of our diversity dashboard which dramatically expands transparency across these metrics, providing visibility across the board to give Tweeps the opportunity to critically examine how their team is doing and be part of the solution. In version 3.0, the only instances where we restrict visibility on the diversity dashboard is when the size of the team is too small to maintain the privacy of our Tweeps. Responsibility for I&D progress belongs to all of us. That’s why the new dashboard also includes an action roadmap that outlines five simple steps every Tweep can take to drive progress in their part of the business. Remind their teams about voluntary Self ID in Workday. By choosing to participate, each Tweep can help ensure the numbers above reflect the true makeup of their team. Join a Global Business Resource Group (BRG) and participate as a team in BRG events. BRGs are Tweep-led, and advocate for underrepresented communities while fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. Check to ensure everyone on their team has completed our I&D trainings: “Healthy Conversations,” “Words Matter,” and “Allyship 101.” Develop an action plan to improve their team’s Inclusion Scores on the next employee engagement. Schedule an hour for their team to watch a #TwitterTogetherTalk (e.g. “How to be an Anti-Racist” or Criminal Justice Reform) and host a debrief using our discussion guides. Transparency We also spent 2020 exploring ways to build on our industry-leading transparency on workforce representation to include impact or outcome-based metrics. One of the things we are looking at is representation in leadership roles and pay equity. Our first step in this new area examines differences by gender, which we will share in our annual report early next year. Work is also underway to increase pay transparency and starting in 2021, we’ll share with Tweeps the pay bands for their individual position. Another important body of work this year was around promotions. Like most companies, we often get questions from Tweeps who want to better understand how promo decisions are made. So in addition to sharing with Tweeps the results of a review of the audit of promo data that we conducted, we’ve launched a Consistency & Fairness Taskforce to review our promotions process across Twitter from end to end. This work will explore new measures to disrupt potential bias: a data-informed promotion readiness pipeline; increased transparency and consistency in the frequency, makeup and process of promotion committees; and increased communications and training about the process. Finally, we’re pleased to have made even more strides this year in inclusive hiring (check out our career site for open roles!). Building on learnings from a pilot program in 2019, we have expanded our Diverse Slates Initiative (DSI) from Senior Director roles to all Manager and above roles across the company. Moving forward, for a hiring decision to be made on any open role, at least one woman (global) and one Black or Latinx candidate (US) must have been considered by the interview panel. The expanded DSI is complemented by an Inclusive Hiring e-learning module centered on five principles we want every Tweep to understand and follow: Always hire the most qualified candidate. Start with a candidate pool that reflects our communities. Ensure a fair and equitable hiring process. Map candidates to core competencies and our values — hire for culture add not culture fit. Lead with diversity and inclusion throughout the interview experience. Taking stock of what actually went right in 2020 is quite the flex. But in retrospect, the strides we made across our inclusion and diversity efforts in leadership, transparency and accountability are significant. They represent the extraordinary efforts of Tweeps across every part of our business. Thanks to them, we’re continuing to take bold steps. Each is intended to push us, and our industry, forward. And we’re not stopping, #UntilWeAllBelong."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/civic-integrity-policy-update","date":"2020-01-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Expanding our policies to further protect the civic conversation","text":"The conversation happening on Twitter is never more important than during elections. Twitter is where people come to hear directly from elected officials and candidates for office, it’s where they come to find breaking news, and increasingly, it’s an integral source for information on when and how to vote in elections. As more people seek ways to vote and express their fundamental civil rights safely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for this type of information has only grown. Updating our policies Our existing Civic Integrity Policy targets the most directly harmful types of content, namely those related to Information or false claims on how to participate in civic processes Content that could intimidate or suppress participation False affiliation In recognition of the changing circumstances of how people will vote in 2020, and in line with our commitment to protecting the integrity of the election conversation, we’re expanding this existing framework. The goal is to further protect against content that could suppress the vote and help stop the spread of harmful misinformation that could compromise the integrity of an election or other civic process. What’s changing? People who use our service have told us that non-specific, disputed information that could cause confusion about an election should be presented with more context. Starting next week, we will label or remove false or misleading information intended to undermine public confidence in an election or other civic process. This includes but is not limited to: False or misleading information that causes confusion about the laws and regulations of a civic process, or officials and institutions executing those civic processes. Disputed claims that could undermine faith in the process itself, e.g. unverified information about election rigging, ballot tampering, vote tallying, or certification of election results. Misleading claims about the results or outcome of a civic process which calls for or could lead to interference with the implementation of the results of the process, e.g. claiming victory before election results have been certified, inciting unlawful conduct to prevent a peaceful transfer of power or orderly succession. In line with our existing enforcement approach, Tweets that are labeled under this expanded policy will have reduced visibility across the service. Reducing the visibility of Tweets means that we will not amplify the Tweets on a number of surfaces across Twitter. However, anyone following the account will still be able to see the Tweet and Retweet. What’s next? This policy will take effect in one week on Thursday, September 17, 2020. We will not permit our service to be abused around civic processes, most importantly elections. Any attempt to do so — both foreign and domestic — will be met with strict enforcement of our rules, which are applied equally and judiciously for everyone."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/looking-ahead-to-2020-twitter-data-partners-weigh-in","date":"2020-01-09T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Social Listening","Customer Care","DataPartners","Insights"],"title":"Looking ahead in 2020: Twitter Data Partners weigh in","text":"2019 was a big year for social media with trends shifting from social management and towards social intelligence as discussed in our recent blog.

The laws that laid a foundation for the spectacular growth of the Internet – with its economic, social, and cultural revelations – are now being reviewed to assess whether they’re fit for the next generation. Indeed, as concern grows in Europe regarding the impact of digital technology and repressive regimes around the world use draconian legal frameworks to stifle online freedoms, the norms that inform new EU legislation has never been more important. The Digital Services Act and the Democracy Action Plan will either renew the promise of the Open Internet or compound a problematic status quo – by limiting our online environment to a few dominant gatekeepers, while failing to meaningfully address the challenges preventing the Internet from realising its potential. We’re writing to you today as a group of companies to advocate for a regulatory conversation around illegal and harmful content that firmly roots Open Internet principles at the heart of the EU’s digital future. There are many other companies and organisations that share the views set out here – we welcome their collaboration in the coming discussions. CONTENT AND SPEECH Unfortunately, the present conversation is too often framed through the prism of content removal alone, where success is judged solely in terms of ever-more content removal in ever-shorter periods of time. Without question, illegal content – including terrorist content and child sexual abuse material – must be removed expeditiously. Indeed, many creative self-regulatory initiatives proposed by the European Commission have demonstrated the effectiveness of an EU-wide approach. Yet by limiting policy options to a solely stay up-come down binary, we forgo promising alternatives that could better address the spread and impact of problematic content while safeguarding rights and the potential for smaller companies to compete. Indeed, removing content cannot be the sole paradigm of Internet policy, particularly when concerned with the phenomenon of ‘legal-but-harmful’ content. Such an approach would benefit only the very largest companies in our industry. We therefore encourage a content moderation discussion that emphasises the difference between illegal and harmful content and highlights the potential of interventions that address how content is surfaced and discovered. Included in this is how consumers are offered real choice in the curation of their online environment. We believe that it’s both more sustainable and more holistically effective to focus on limiting the number of people who encounter harmful content. This can be achieved by placing a technological emphasis on visibility over prevalence, supporting measures towards algorithmic transparency and control, setting limits to the discoverability of harmful content, further exploring community moderation, and providing meaningful user choice. The tactics will vary from service to service but the underlying approach will be familiar. By focusing on these kinds of metrics and developing corresponding transparency standards, EU policy interventions can better tackle the harms associated with problematic content online, while mitigating the negative impact on freedom of expression that blunt content removal obligations entail. We further support a harmonised notice-and-action mechanism for illegal content as proposed by the D9+ group, which would clarify obligations and provide legal certainty in situations where content removal is the most appropriate solution, without overburdening SMEs or limiting users’ rights to redress. Notice-and-action mechanisms should also include measures proportionate to the nature and impact of the illegal content in question. REGULATION FOR A NEW GENERATION In the digital world, content policy can influence the shape of markets. “One-size-fits-all” approaches that fail to consider the vast array of differentiated services that make up our online environment risk having a disproportionate – and potentially crippling – impact on smaller players, thereby inadvertently helping to entrench large companies that have greater compliance resources. Therefore, as regulatory mechanisms are considered, we recommend a tech-neutral and human rights-based approach to ensure legislation transcends individual companies and technological cycles. Interventions like the recent EU Copyright directive remind us that there are major drawbacks in prescribing generalised compliance solutions. These solutions have a regressive impact on smaller players and perversely incentivise the deployment of flawed technology. Moreover, we simply cannot anticipate how burgeoning technology will shape the services and platforms we use today. Consequently, our rules must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate and allow for the harnessing of sectoral shifts, such as the rise of decentralised hosting of content and data. This far-sighted approach can be ensured by developing regulatory proposals that optimise for effective collaboration and meaningful transparency between three core groups: companies, regulators and civil society. While companies must take primary responsibility for designing and operating their services with diligence and care, co-regulatory oversight grounded in regional and global norms can ensure these efforts are effective, durable, and protective of individuals’ rights. We believe these positions and principles offer a path to an online society that renews the original promise of the Internet while deftly meeting our shared challenges. We ask the Commission, Parliament, Member States, and all stakeholders to consider our collective views while developing these historic laws which will likely govern our online lives for a generation, while setting another groundbreaking precedent for the world to follow. In sum, we ask the EU to defend the Open Internet.

Twitter plays a critical role around the globe by empowering democratic conversation, driving civic participation, facilitating meaningful political debate, and enabling people to hold those in power accountable. But we know that this cannot be achieved unless the integrity of this critical dialogue on Twitter is protected from attempts — both foreign and domestic — to undermine it. Today, we're announcing additional, significant product and enforcement updates that will increase context and encourage more thoughtful consideration before Tweets are amplified. How our Civic Integrity Policy applies on and around Election night We do not allow anyone to use Twitter to manipulate or interfere in elections or other civic processes, and recently expanded our civic integrity policy to address how we’ll handle misleading information surrounding these events. Under this policy, we will label Tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate and will remove Tweets that encourage violence or call for people to interfere with election results or the smooth operation of polling places. More specifically: People on Twitter, including candidates for office, may not claim an election win before it is authoritatively called. To determine the results of an election in the US, we require either an announcement from state election officials, or a public projection from at least two authoritative, national news outlets that make independent election calls. Tweets which include premature claims will be labeled and direct people to our official US election page. Tweets meant to incite interference with the election process or with the implementation of election results, such as through violent action, will be subject to removal. This covers all Congressional races and the Presidential Election. New prompts and more warnings on misleading Tweets We currently may label Tweets that violate our policies against misleading information about civic integrity, COVID-19, and synthetic and manipulated media. Starting next week, when people attempt to Retweet one of these Tweets with a misleading information label, they will see a prompt pointing them to credible information about the topic before they are able to amplify it. Tweets with labels are already de-amplified through our own recommendation systems and these new prompts will give individuals more context on labeled Tweets so they can make more informed decisions on whether or not they want to amplify them to their followers. In addition to these prompts, we will now add additional warnings and restrictions on Tweets with a misleading information label from US political figures (including candidates and campaign accounts), US-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers, or that obtain significant engagement. People must tap through a warning to see these Tweets, and then will only be able to Quote Tweet; likes, Retweets and replies will be turned off, and these Tweets won’t be algorithmically recommended by Twitter. We expect this will further reduce the visibility of misleading information, and will encourage people to reconsider if they want to amplify these Tweets. Encouraging more consideration Beginning October 20 through at least the end of Election week in the US, when we will assess their continued necessity, we will also introduce the following changes globally to Twitter: First, we will encourage people to add their own commentary prior to amplifying content by prompting them to Quote Tweet instead of Retweet. People who go to Retweet will be brought to the Quote Tweet composer where they’ll be encouraged to comment before sending their Tweet. Though this adds some extra friction for those who simply want to Retweet, we hope it will encourage everyone to not only consider why they are amplifying a Tweet, but also increase the likelihood that people add their own thoughts, reactions and perspectives to the conversation. If people don’t add anything on the Quote Tweet composer, it will still appear as a Retweet. We will begin testing this change on Twitter.com for some people beginning today. Second, we will prevent “liked by” and “followed by” recommendations from people you don’t follow from showing up in your timeline and won’t send notifications for these Tweets. These recommendations can be a helpful way for people to see relevant conversations from outside of their network, but we are removing them because we don’t believe the “Like” button provides sufficient, thoughtful consideration prior to amplifying Tweets to people who don’t follow the author of the Tweet, or the relevant topic that the Tweet is about. This will likely slow down how quickly Tweets from accounts and topics you don’t follow can reach you, which we believe is a worthwhile sacrifice to encourage more thoughtful and explicit amplification. Finally, we will only surface Trends in the “For You” tab in the United States that include additional context. That means there will be a description Tweet or article that represents or summarizes why that term is trending. We’ve been adding more context to Trends during the last few months, but this change will ensure that only Trends with added context show up in the “For You” tab in the United States, which is where the vast majority of people discover what’s trending. This will help people more quickly gain an informed understanding of the high volume public conversation in the US and also help reduce the potential for misleading information to spread. Constantly working to protect elections The improvements we’re announcing today are the latest in our comprehensive effort to apply the lessons of 2016, and from elections that have happened around the world since, to the 2020 US Election. This is exemplified in our efforts surrounding the last US Midterm Election through this month: 9/2018 - Encouraged voter registration for all Americans during the 2018 midterm elections 10/2018 - Tightened our policies and zero-tolerance approach to hacked materials 10/2018 - Produced, and continue to update, the only archive in the entire industry of state-backed information operations 1/2019 - Issued a comprehensive review of our efforts to protect the 2018 U.S. midterms 6/2019 - Launched public interest notice and defined our approach on public interest 10/2019 - Banned all political ads on Twitter, including ads from state-controlled media 12/2019 - Added Election Labels to candidates’ accounts 2/2020 - Introduced our rules on and labels for synthetic and manipulated media 3/2020 - Held planning exercises to prepare for a variety of Election Day scenarios 5/2020 - Added labels and warnings to potentially harmful misleading information 8/2020 - Deployed labels on government and state-affiliated media accounts 9/2020 - Implemented account security requirements for high-profile political accounts 9/2020 - Built a U.S. Election hub containing credible news and voting resources 9/2020 - Encouraged voter registration and emphasizing safe voting options 9/2020 - Expanded our civic integrity policy to include specifics around pre and post election day Twitter has a critical role to play in protecting the integrity of the election conversation, and we encourage candidates, campaigns, news outlets and voters to use Twitter respectfully and to recognize our collective responsibility to the electorate to guarantee a safe, fair and legitimate democratic process this November. As with any other product change, we will learn, observe, and iterate based on the impact of these changes, to inform both our strategy around future global elections and Twitter's overall product experience. In addition to these changes, as we have throughout the election period, we will have teams around the world working to monitor the integrity of the conversation and take action when needed. We have already increased the size and capacity of our teams focused on the US Election and will have the necessary staffing to respond rapidly to issues that may arise on Twitter on Election night and in the days that follow. For more updates as the election continues, please follow @TwitterGov. ### This has been updated November 2, 2020, with updated information below on labeling election results. Offering further details on our plans for Election results Because this is an unusual election — restrictions in response to COVID-19 have led to historically high numbers of mail-in ballots, which may result in some state results not being resolved on election night — we are taking additional steps to provide context when results have not been officially called. We believe this is the right thing to do to protect the integrity of the conversation around the election while counting is ongoing and before results are announced by state authorities. Beginning on election night through the inauguration, we will label some Tweets that make claims about election results. We will be prioritizing the presidential election and other highly contested races where there may be significant issues with misleading information based on the below criteria. Who is eligible for a label? All accounts with US 2020 candidate labels (including US 2020 Presidential candidate and campaign accounts) US-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers Tweets that have significant engagement (25k likes or 25k Quote Tweets and/or Retweets). Who do we consider official sources for election results? State election officials (as determined by the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors) National news outlets that have dedicated, independent election decision desks: -ABC News -Associated Press -CBS News -CNN -Decision Desk HQ -Fox News -National Election Pool -NBC News -Reuters The official Twitter accounts of these news organizations, as well as Tweets directly citing a call from these news organizations, will be exempted from labels about election results."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/amplifying-suicideprevention-resources-on-twitter","date":"2020-01-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Community Outreach","Safety","Company"],"title":"Amplifying #SuicidePrevention resources on Twitter","text":"Protecting the health of the public conversation is a top priority for our company. Many people use Twitter to express unique points of view and talk openly about concerns. As we grapple with the weight and reality of an unprecedented public health crisis, it is our job to ensure that Twitter remains a safe space for anyone interested in mental health tips and resources or opening up about their individual mental health concerns. Suicide prevention in extraordinary times According to the World Health Organization, almost 800,000 people die due to suicide every year. Further, suicide rates can increase in prolonged crises and experts note that the COVID-19 global pandemic will cause distress and leave many people vulnerable to mental health problems and suicidal behavior. The US Center for Disease Control reports that younger adults, racial/ethnic minorities and essential workers are disproportionately faced with these mental health challenges. These statistics emphasize the urgency and importance of elevating the global conversation on suicide prevention and self harm, and we recognize that we have a role and responsibility to help improve access to and raise awareness of suicide prevention and self harm information and services. Raising awareness and elevating the public conversation Earlier this summer, we worked with various mental health partners across the globe to raise awareness and encourage honest conversation around the emotional challenges we are experiencing together, amid the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. Since then, we’ve expanded our work with NGOs to identify, connect, and engage vulnerable people across the world. In particular, we’ve continued to engage suicide prevention organizations and counseling services to ensure that people on Twitter feel safe and have access to support when they need it most. World Suicide Prevention Day World Suicide Prevention Day on September 10, 2020 welcomes another opportunity to continue our momentum in spreading awareness and encouraging action to prevent suicide and self harm. Twitter is grateful to continue our global World Suicide Prevention Day partnership with the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP). Together, for the third year, we are launching a custom emoji in the shape of an orange ribbon - the international symbol for World Suicide Prevention Day. The emoji will appear when people Tweet with the hashtags #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, #WSPD, #WSPD2020 and #SuicidePrevention through September 25 and is activated in 23 languages. We are working with over 20 nonprofit partners worldwide to offer Ads for Good grants and amplify their local campaigns on Twitter. These partners are leading suicide prevention and mental health awareness in markets across the Asia Pacific, US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Africa. We are also amplifying the creative activations of our Trust & Safety Council Suicide Prevention & Mental Health advisory group partners around World Suicide Prevention Day across the globe, including: #ICANHELP: Using Twitter to amplify ideas from student leaders on tackling suicide in local communities across the US. #MentalHealthPH: Starting a hashtag campaign, #MayKaramayKa, to encourage people in the Philippines to thank those who helped them in times of need. They’re also hosting a Q&A on September 10th for mental health professionals and psychologists to answer questions in real-time. Mentally Aware Nigeria: Launching an animated video series covering a range of topics from identifying suicidal behaviors to supporting those in need. TELL: Launching #StepUp, a virtual step challenge encouraging everyone to take one step for each life lost daily from suicide in Japan - between WSPD and World Mental Health Day. Beyond Blue: Showcasing stories of 8 individuals who experienced suicidal ideation in Australia, empowering individuals in crisis to know that support is available. #ThereIsHelp We’ve partnered with local mental health authorities and nonprofits in each market to offer #ThereIsHelp - a notification service that provides valuable mental health information and resources via Twitter and email. When someone searches for terms associated with suicide or self harm, the top search result is a notification encouraging them to reach out for help. This year we expanded the prompts to several new markets in consultation with local mental health partners to ensure that we are sharing the latest and most helpful resources in our #ThereisHelp prompts across the globe. #ThereIsHelp is available for people in the US, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the UK. Twitter’s active commitment to improving mental health plays an important role in addressing suicide and self harm, and we look forward to continued collaboration with suicide prevention organizations across the world."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/five-powerful-women-in-data-martech","date":"2020-01-08T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Five powerful women in data MarTech","text":"To celebrate Women’s History Month, we sat down with five powerful women leaders from the Twitter Official Partner Program (TOPP) to hear their stories and perspectives on data marketing for tech companies and why female voices are critical for success. “The fact that we have so much female leadership amongst our partners is fantastic and these are women who are really leading the way in their own organizations but even beyond.” - Diana Helander, Twitter, Director of Marketing Yoli Chishom @yolichisholm VP of Marketing, Sprinklr Yoli Chisholm is the Vice President of Marketing at Sprinklr, a provider of enterprise customer experience management software.

The accounts that we have published in our archive today - the only archive of its kind in the industry - include independent information operations that we have attributed to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Thailand and Russia. Post-investigation, we permanently suspended all 1,594 accounts associated with the five networks, for various violations of our platform manipulation policies. Along with our enforcement, we shared early access to the data we’re releasing today with the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) for independent investigation and analysis. Iran Based on information shared by industry peers, we identified a network of primarily compromised accounts on Twitter operating from Iran, which artificially amplified conversations on politically sensitive topics, including Black Lives Matter (BLM), the murder of George Floyd, and other issues of racial and social justice in the United States. In cases where we identify that an account has been compromised for the purposes of engaging in violative behavior, we aim to restore the account to the original account holder. We were able to do so successfully in most cases here. In all, we suspended a total of 104 accounts connected with this campaign. To protect the privacy of people whose accounts were used without permission for this campaign, we are hashing all user-identifiable information connected with this set across all the data we are releasing. Saudi Arabia We investigated and removed 33 accounts originating in Saudi Arabia, with ties to the Saudi government. These accounts were created to impersonate key Qatari political figures and to advance narratives about Qatari politics which are geostrategically favorable to the Saudi authorities. Cuba We have permanently suspended 526 fake accounts run by youth organizations with ties to the Cuban government, including Unión de Jóvenes Comunistas (UJC) and Federación Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU). Thailand Our investigation uncovered a network of accounts partaking in information operations that we can reliably link to the Royal Thai Army (RTA). These accounts were engaging in amplifying pro-RTA and pro-government content, as well as engaging in behavior targeting prominent political opposition figures. We are disclosing 926 accounts today and continue to enforce against small-scale activity associated with this network, as we identify it. Russia We communicated proactively about this set of five accounts at the beginning of September 2020. Today, we’re adding them to the archive. Working collaboratively with industry peers and the FBI, we were made aware of a number of accounts that had potential links to a fake news agency called PeaceData. They were immediately removed from the service and we’ve marked all links to the site as unsafe across the service. Our work in this area Our goal with these disclosures is to continue to build public understanding around the ways in which state actors try to abuse and undermine open democratic conversation. To build on this mission we hosted an online conference this summer with Carnegie that brought together industry experts to discuss further collaboration and ways to empower deeper research of these critical issues. We will continue to facilitate these forums in 2021. We believe we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the public conversation and hold state power to account. We will continue to keep our archive updated so the public, journalists, and the research community can access and analyze these networks.

Today, the practice of predicting the future has come a long way from ancient Greece. Magic and spiritual consultation has been replaced with statistical models and data. Mathematicians and data experts are applying methods such as regression analysis, decision trees and neural networks to calculate probable future events and behaviour across consumer, social and scientific spheres. Given the amount of interest and investment being put into prediction, our hunger to know the future clearly hasn’t waned. With respect to business, our obsession with prediction makes sense. In today’s constantly accelerating hyper-competitive environment it’s never been more crucial to be the first mover. Consider the competitive world of consumer products. Between 2013 and 2018, $20B in sales was lost by large and midsize U.S. CPGs to small and private-label brands. These small, nimble challengers proved adept at identifying and capitalizing on new and emerging consumer trends and being first to market with innovative new products. Put simply, in the business world those who can best predict the future will win. But where to start? Social data and social prediction may hold the key. Twitter is often thought of as the place where news breaks first, where the news gets its news. And while that’s absolutely correct, what is less appreciated about Twitter is that it’s also the place to see and understand the trends that are shaping society. We’ve always thought of it as the world’s largest focus group, where people share their experiences on anything and everything. And while some of these insights might be quite mundane, in the aggregate they allow us to understand human behaviours, moods and mindsets. They reveal taste preferences, friction and frustration with products or services and desires for unarticulated needs. And when you combine 14 years of these insights (Twitter’s age) with predictive modelling techniques, you can turn trendspotting from an ad-hoc and subjective art form into a more systematic, data-driven capability. Used and applied correctly it changes your company’s consumer intelligence competency from a focus on what’s happened, to what’s going to happen and how do we take advantage? This is an emerging space to be sure, but we’re already seeing some impressive results. Take Black Swan, for example, a data science and technology company specializing in social prediction. Using Natural Language Processing technology, they’ve built data sets based on social media conversations surrounding specific product categories. These datasets allow them to identify, size and forecast the future importance of every topic of conversation that’s being talked about by consumers; from macro-level drivers like sustainability to specific trend manifestations like a trending ingredient. For example, Black Swan says they can predict how popular Bakuchiol – the plant-based vegan alternative to retinol – will be in 6,12, or 18 months’ time versus other trendy ingredients in the skincare category. According to Black Swan, their clients such as PepsiCo and other global brands are using these trend predictions to improve the velocity and throughput of their innovation programs, accelerating time to market while also helping to prioritize their corporate development and acquisition efforts. A great example is PepsiCo’s Global Insights team, who have been using Black Swan’s social prediction software to fast-track their new product ideation process. As new concepts and ideas are conceived in a workshop environment they are instantly validated against the latest trend data and predictions in an iterative process. The result: several new product concepts for their snacking portfolio were optimised and validated in just four hours, a process that traditionally took them at least four weeks! When it comes to tapping into emerging trends and accelerating innovation, it’s easy to see how prediction can be a game-changer. Need a resolution for 2020? Why not put aside oracles and crystal balls for good and look to Twitter for inspiration? I predict it will be the best decision you make all year."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/spending-2020-together-on-twitter","date":"2020-01-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data","Insights","#OnlyOnTwitter","Society & Culture"],"title":"Spending 2020 Together on Twitter","text":"For over a decade, we’ve released a year in review report, recapping the trends, the moments, and the memes that dominated Twitter that year. But 2020 is different. The world saw heartbreaking loss but also tremendous courage. How do we possibly recap a year like this? By turning our attention to how we all got through it together: the ways we kept ourselves entertained, the changes we made, and the messages of support that we shared with each other. If you’re over 2020, we get it; if you’re curious to see how the world conversed, coped, and even celebrated this year, read on for a brief tour through the Tweets of 2020. In the midst of everything that happened in the world this year, Twitter was the place where we came together to keep our sanity during quarantine, be forces of change, and yes, still jump in on the latest viral meme. #ThisHappened on Twitter: The most Retweeted and top Liked Tweets of the year encapsulate the full spectrum of life in 2020: loss, contemplation, distraction, entertainment, and a dash of humor. The world mourned the death of actor Chadwick Boseman, making the Tweet announcing his tragic passing the most Retweeted of the year and the most Liked of all time. Most Retweeted Tweets worldwide: Top Liked Tweets worldwide: Note: We only feature one Tweet per account and we don’t consider Tweets that offer reward in exchange for followers or engagement. It will come as no surprise that the top hashtag used by the most people this year was none other than #COVID19. Not only was the hashtag (and other variations on it) Tweeted nearly 400 million times, but we also saw the ways in which it changed how we Tweeted about so many other topics. With much of the world staying home more - in fact, #StayHome was the 3rd biggest hashtag of the year - we saw a change in habits through Twitter. Globally, there were the equivalent of more than 7,000 Tweets per minute about TV and movies this year (so it’s no surprise that the 🛋 emoji went up 40%). Tweets about cooking nearly tripled this year (but that banana bread craze surged for only about three months and is now closer to normal-times levels), and the trends in food-related emojis suggest that everyone developed a serious sweet tooth and all those video calls created an upswing in adult beverages. Even though many sports went on pause and looked a bit different when they returned, there were still two billion Tweets about sports. No stadium? No problem. With no fans in seats and sports bars not an option, people turned to the sports community on Twitter to share their hot takes and feelings of excitement, disappointment and in some cases, 😲 reactions. Following #COVID19, the second most-Tweeted hashtag of the year was #BlackLivesMatter. The world mobilized and amplified the need for equality and social justice following the death of George Floyd, who was the third most-Tweeted-about person globally. People continued to utilize Twitter to publicly advocate for political change and demand accountability from world leaders this year. Over 700 million Tweets were sent in 2020 about elections around the world and Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Narendra Modi and Kamala Harris were among the most Tweeted-about global figures. Citizens and sports stars alike, from the UK to Colombia and India turned to Twitter to advocate for important causes: This year also brought on a renewed sense of gratitude and support for our communities. Tweets expressing being grateful or thankful increased by 20% globally, with a particular recognition of doctors (+135%), teachers (+30%), and essential/frontline workers (that phrase was Tweeted more than 17 million times this year).

Back then, I observed that individuals and organizations were finally discovering the unique role that social data, in concert with other data sources, can play in helping to solve real business problems. While the uptake in digital data sources by the research industry was well underway, little could I have imagined that a global pandemic would soon accelerate these dynamics, as almost overnight the world moved online. As one research agency friend put it: “Covid-19 probably condensed three to four years of market research evolution into three or four months.\" And as brands have become accustomed to these new approaches to conducting research and gathering insight, it’s hard to imagine a rush back to the more traditional resource-heavy, set-piece approaches of the past. So, as we exit this most unusual of years, what are the main trends driving the awareness and adoption of social intelligence today? In my conversations with social intelligence practitioners, four themes emerged that are changing market research more broadly, thus presenting an opportunity for social intelligence to shine. 1. Speed to insight Clients are pushing to reduce the use of traditional, ad hoc market research projects in favour of quicker, more cost-effective approaches that provide real-time, behavioural insights. Speed to insight has always been a strength of social data. Not only does it give researchers instant access to millions of public consumer opinions on just about any topic imaginable, accessing that treasure trove of insight is a fraction of the cost of traditional research methods with similar sample sizes. Furthermore, it’s reusable, with multiple projects able to repurpose the same data sets in support of different research questions. If you are looking for speed and value for money, social delivers. 2. Explosion of external data sources 20 years ago, if you wanted market share data, you had a very small group of providers to choose from. Today, you can get this data from dozens of sources. And as the importance and value of data have grown, many companies are now monetizing their own unique data sets. Everyone, it seems, is a data provider. The challenge now is in choosing the most relevant data set for the problem at hand or the question being asked. And far from being lost among these myriad data sources, social data is carving out an important place for itself, chiefly as a unique window into real observed human behaviours, with several advantages over traditional insight gathering techniques. First, its unprompted nature gets around one of the big challenges of research—the introduction of bias by the questions being asked. Secondly, social posts are sent in the moment, when the consumer is actually having the experience, therefore representing a much richer and authentic view of consumers’ true feelings on a topic, as opposed to asking them to recount that experience days or weeks later and out of the context in which they had it. This feature of social data should not be underestimated, for very little market research delivered today is conducted with that type of context in mind. And finally, social data’s continuous nature allows you to move away from the one-and-done practice that has historically characterized market research projects and towards a longitudinal approach to data gathering. This allows you to see trends emerge over time. It also has the added advantage of allowing you to go back and analyze a topic retrospectively, uncovering views and attitudes preserved in time, forever. 3. DIY meets data integration Historically, full-service research agencies provided both the data and the insights, but they are now increasingly seeing competition from their very own clients. The growth of DIY research platforms has allowed brands to insource market research capabilities such as survey creation and distribution. And brands have made data gathering and customer feedback collection an integral part of the user journey and experience, and therefore already know a lot about their customers. When combined, brands are better able to use their customers’ behavioural and transactional data to ask the right questions at the right times, thus providing even more relevant customer insight. To date, social listening tools, a form of DIY research, have been the primary gateway for organizations to access social data. This is quickly changing as social data feeds are becoming increasingly embedded within a wide variety of solutions, ranging from Enterprise Feedback Management to digital data analytics. It’s this combination of social data with other data sets that is so promising and, with a little help from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), should provide unique new insights into how people think and behave. 4. Truly game-changing innovation From the phone survey to the online survey and from social intelligence to artificial intelligence, new sources and techniques have emerged over the years that have improved the diversity and efficiency of data collection and analysis. They have also brought with them a host of new entrants into the industry, whether they be technology providers or tech-enabled specialist consultancies. The adoption of these type of digital analytics providers, for lack of a better term, has expanded the definition of the market research industry and doubled its size, now reckoned to be valued at $90 billion.1 One of the big underlying drivers behind this has been a slow but steady move away from question-based research methods and towards observational methodologies such as neuroscience, behavioural economics and data science. Dave Soderberg, Chief Data Officer at Black Swan Data, touched upon this revolution in his excellent blog post on the end of question-based market research. Data Science in particular, aided by advances in different types of AI such as Natural Language Processing, has allowed us to understand and classify vast amounts of unstructured data (such as social) in a way that was unimaginable even a few years ago. It’s this continued innovation that will allow researchers and analysts the ability to finally leverage social data as the world’s largest focus group. As Jeremy Hollow, Founder & MD of Listen + Learn Research succinctly put it: “Why are we struggling to recruit people to talk about things they’re already freely talking about on social?” 2021 and the slope of enlightenment After a year like 2020, it would be foolish to make any predictions about 2021 (as I attempted for 2020), other than to say that the importance and adoption of social intelligence within the insights world will only continue to grow. Even Gartner now thinks it’s finally entering the “Slope of Enlightenment.” It has certainly been a journey, with social intelligence reaching its formative, teenage years just as market research hits a midlife crisis and tries to redefine itself. So where do we go from here then? I’m reminded of the Royal Society’s motto, “Nullius in verba” - “take nobody’s word for it.” If you’re ready to start your move to social intelligence, get inspired at data.twitter.com. 1 ESOMAR Global Market Research Study 2020"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/events/2019/2019-gaming-on-twitter","date":"2020-01-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data","Partnerships","Events"],"title":"2019 Gaming on Twitter","text":"Twitter is the place for gaming conversation and connections and 2019 was bigger than ever.

In 2019, we banned all state-backed media advertising and political advertising from Twitter. Today we’re expanding the types of political accounts we label. We will add new labels to the following categories of Twitter accounts: Accounts of key government officials, including foreign ministers, institutional entities, ambassadors, official spokespeople, and key diplomatic leaders. At this time, our focus is on senior officials and entities who are the official voice of the state abroad Accounts belonging to state-affiliated media entities, their editors-in-chief, and/or their senior staff How do we define government accounts for these new labels? Our focus is on senior officials and entities that are the voice of the nation state abroad, specifically the account categories listed above. Labels will only be applied to accounts from the countries represented in the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. For transparency and practicality, we are starting with a limited and clearly-defined group of countries before expanding to a wider range of countries in the future. We believe this is an important step so that when people see an account discussing geopolitical issues from another country, they have context on its national affiliation and are better informed about who they represent. At this time, we're not labeling the personal accounts of heads of state, as these accounts enjoy widespread name recognition, media attention, and public awareness. Institutional accounts associated with their offices that changeover depending on election results will be labeled, however. In general, we're focused on those within the respective administrations underneath the head of state that offer its policy perspective abroad. How do we define state-affiliated media accounts for these new labels? State-affiliated media is defined as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution. Unlike independent media, state-affiliated media frequently use their news coverage as a means to advance a political agenda. We believe that people have the right to know when a media account is affiliated directly or indirectly with a state actor. State-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK or NPR in the US for example, will not be labeled. As part of the development of this process, we consulted with a number of expert groups, including members of the Digital and Human Rights Advisory group in Twitter’s Trust & Safety Council. We will also no longer amplify state-affiliated media accounts or their Tweets through our recommendation systems including on the home timeline, notifications, and search. Government accounts listed in category one are not affected by this change. To offer even more context to the public, clicking the labels on both categories of accounts directs people to an article explaining the policy and referring them to the Twitter Transparency Report for additional information. Notification and appeals process We’ll notify any account that’s labeled and if the account owner believes we’ve made a mistake, they can reach out to us directly. Next steps We plan to continue expanding this approach to additional countries over time and look forward to providing additional updates as those plans take shape."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/twitter-announces-promoted-trend-spotlight-goes-global","date":"2020-01-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Video","Ads","Brands","Product","Marketing"],"title":"Twitter announces Promoted Trend Spotlight goes global","text":"Today, we’re announcing the launch of the newest takeover ad product on Twitter, Promoted Trend Spotlight. This takeover ad placement pairs the undeniable stopping power of video with the premium real estate of Twitter’s Explore tab. The Explore tab, Twitter’s collection of trending topics and hashtags, is where people go to see what’s happening, making it a prime location for advertisers to connect with people and conversation. Launching a new streaming service – even when it’s called Disney+ – requires breaking through and becoming a part of the cultural conversation. We knew social platforms, including Twitter, would be playing a key role. We leveraged the Promoted Trend Spotlight throughout our campaign as it was important for us to truly capture people's attention at scale. Trevor Kelley Vice President, Digital Marketing, Disney+ We are now making Promoted Trend Spotlight generally available in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, and expanding the product to 12 additional markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, and Thailand. How it works: As a complement to Twitter’s Promoted Trend takeover product, Promoted Trend Spotlight supports 6-second videos and GIFs, as well as static images. Creative displays on mobile and desktop, with the ad running edge-to-edge on mobile. Your ad will appear at the top of the Explore tab for the first two visits per person, per day. After the initial two visits, the placement moves to the standard Promoted Trend placement and organic editorial content resurfaces in the Spotlight placement. In an eye-tracking study conducted by EyeSee, a global behavioral research company, people spent 26% more time looking at the Promoted Trend Spotlight as compared to the standard Promoted Trend unit. These longer dwell times generated impact throughout the funnel: from +113% higher ad recall and +18% higher brand consideration to +67% lift in stated likelihood to use a brand in the future. In addition, according to internal Twitter data, people were three times more likely to click through an ad in the Spotlight unit than the standard Promoted Trend. Key features: Captures attention: With immersive, full-width creative, Promoted Trend Spotlight captures attention and reinforces your message. Differentiates your brand: Sitting atop the Explore tab, Promoted Trend Spotlight differentiates your brand from other placements on Twitter by appearing next to highly curated editorial content. Surfaces conversation: Tying together the prominent placement and expansive coverage atop Twitter’s Explore tab, brands have the opportunity to generate conversation and invite discussion. For more information on Promoted Trend Spotlight and to confirm availability and pricing, please contact your Twitter Client Partner."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-of-our-work-around-taiwan2020","date":"2020-01-05T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"An update of our work around #Taiwan2020","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/gaming_esports_twitter_insights_first_half_2020","date":"2020-01-04T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Twitter insights on gaming and esports for the first half of 2020","text":"Whether you’re celebrating the return of SKATE or you’re coordinating turnip sales with Elijah Wood, Twitter was home of the public conversation around gaming during the first half of the year.

Amid the already growing fear and uncertainty around the pandemic, last week again brought attention to something perhaps more pervasive: the long-standing racism and injustices faced by Black and Brown people on a daily basis. The recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade and George Floyd, and the victimization of Christian Cooper have left many of us angry, and with a deep sense of grief. But that grief doesn’t compare to what Black people face every day. #SayTheirNames Now is a time to take care –– and take action. Now is a time for #Allyship. At Twitter, our principles of allyship are simple: Learn, Ask, Show up, and Speak up. Learn Do your own research. To practice allyship, it’s important to first understand the historical and structural contexts that have led to racism and discrimination that are so ingrained in society. Here is recommended reading to get started on your journey, Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong, How to be an Anti-Racist, and “Who gets to be afraid in America?” Also check out this Anti-Racism Resource Guide. Ask Understand that answering questions takes emotional labor — be mindful of safe spaces and make sure you’ve done your personal learning before you ask a Black person to share with you. Approach questions with empathy and in a way to understand people’s lived experiences. Do not approach asking questions from a place of disbelief. Some questions you could ask include: “If you have the time/energy, do you feel comfortable sharing your experience with me?” “This week is heavy. How are you feeling/coping?” Note: When someone’s sharing their experience with you, it’s enough to simply say, “I hear you.” Don’t feel like you need to respond, or provide your own story. Instead, center them and what they’re sharing with you. Show up People are dealing with a lot right now. But especially for Black people, this is an incredibly difficult time. Be mindful of that in emails, on social media, and in communications. Offer to reschedule meetings and be as flexible as possible with any deadlines. From donating to organizations fighting for racial justice and police reform, to supporting Black-owned businesses and signing petitions, check out this list of 75 ways you can do something for racial justice and leverage your area of influence to create change. Conduct a self-audit. Who’s in your circle? Who do you turn to for advice? Who do you follow and engage with on social media? Do not re-share pictures and videos of violence perpetrated against Black people. While we may want to increase awareness, such media can be triggering and retraumatizing. While social distancing, it may seem difficult to show up physically for your colleagues or the Black community. Do it virtually — but without expectations. This is about them, not you. Speak up In meetings, on social media, in conference calls, in chats with friends and family. In your circle, create more allies. Address anti-Black sentiments when you see them and discuss the violence and injustice that Black communities face. Continuously leverage your voice and privilege to amplify Black and Brown communities. Violence, police brutality, racism, and discrimination aren’t isolated incidents. They’re happening everywhere everyday. Here’s an example of how you can use your voice: Allyship is not about who you are, but what you do consistently and authentically. Do the work. Everyone is dealing with a lot these days, but be especially mindful of Black and Brown communities who regularly face threats to their wellbeing, violence, and hate because of their identity. There is no better time to stand up for what’s right. #UntilWeAllBelong #BlackLivesMatter"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/stepping-up-our-work-to-protect-the-public-conversation-around-covid-19","date":"2020-01-03T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"Stepping up our work to protect the public conversation around Covid-19","text":"We recently revised our travel policy to ensure we’re playing our part in the global containment efforts relating to coronavirus (Covid-19). In tandem, our entire company is stepping up its internal and external efforts to build partnerships, protect the public conversation, help people find authoritative health information, raise relief funds, and contribute pro bono advertising support to ensure people are getting the right message, from the right source. With a critical mass of expert organizations, official government accounts, health professionals, and epidemiologists on our service, our goal is to elevate and amplify authoritative health information as far as possible. Global expansion of the Covid-19 search prompt Launched six days before the official designation of the virus in January, we continue to expand our dedicated search prompt feature to ensure that when you come to the service for information about Covid-19, you are met with credible, authoritative content at the top of your search experience. We have been consistently monitoring the conversation on the service to make sure keywords — including common misspellings — also generate the search prompt. In each country where we have launched the initiative, we have partnered with the national public health agency or the World Health Organization (@WHO) directly. The proactive search prompt is in place with official local partnerships in over 70 countries around the world. They include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, and Yemen. Protecting the conversation The power of a uniquely open service during a public health emergency is clear. The speed and borderless nature of Twitter presents an extraordinary opportunity to get the word out and ensure people have access to the latest information from expert sources around the world. To support that mission, our global Trust & Safety team is continuing its zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to abuse our service at this critical juncture. At present, we’re not seeing significant coordinated platform manipulation efforts around these issues. However, we will remain vigilant and have invested substantially in our proactive abilities to ensure trends, search, and other common areas of the service are protected from malicious behaviors. As ever, we also welcome constructive and open information sharing from governments and academics to further our work in these areas — we’re in this together. We have also ensured the Events feature contains credible information about Covid-19 and is available at the top of the home timeline for everyone in Japan, South Korea, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the UAE, the UK and the US. #AdsForGood support & additional protections Based on our Inappropriate Content Policy, we will halt any attempt by advertisers to opportunistically use the Covid-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads. Government entities that want to disseminate public health information will be permitted to promote ads on Covid-19. In the case of Covid-19, we have put additional safeguards into place in order to facilitate the sharing of trusted public health information and to reduce potential harm to users. We are currently prohibiting the promotion of all medical masks and alcohol hand sanitizers due to strong correlation to Covid-19 and instances of inflated prices globally. In addition, we’re committing Ads for Good credits to nonprofit organizations to ensure they can build campaigns to fact-check and get reputable health information to the widest possible audiences. For example, as part of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN/@factchecknet), we have supported the Spanish organization @maldita_es and @malditobulo, which focuses on mitigating the impact of disinformation on public discourse through fact-checking and data journalism techniques. In Asia, we have partnered with the Taiwan Fact Checking Center (@taiwantfc), which has been using Twitter to connect with IFCN fact checkers around the world via #CoronavirusFacts. They are working in real-time to find credible information and debunk rumors in Chinese. Furthering our partnerships Our Global Public Policy team has open lines of communication with relevant multinational stakeholders, including the World Health Organization, numerous global government and public health organizations, and officials around the world, to ensure they can troubleshoot account issues, get their experts verified, and seek strategic counsel as they use the power of Twitter to mitigate harm. We’re also in close contact with our industry peers and will attend all relevant cross-functional meetings. As a uniquely open service, our data is being used in research every day and our researchers hub is publicly available. We welcome applications for the use of Twitter data to support research on Covid-19. We will also explore further #DataForGood partnerships to assess how our data products can enhance academic and NGO understanding of public health emergencies now and into the future. Playing our part through donation matching We've set up a dedicated internal Covid-19 campaign page through our employee donation matching program to support humanitarian response and relief efforts around the world. Any Twitter employee can donate to relevant nonprofit organizations, and Twitter will match donations up to $2,000 per employee. What can you do? Looking for advice on how best to use Twitter in a time like this? Follow @WHO and your local health ministry — seek out the authoritative health information and ignore the noise. See something suspicious or abusive, report it to us immediately. Most importantly, think before you Tweet. Through Twitter Moments, we have curated longer-form content that helps tell the full story of what’s happening around Covid-19 globally. For educators and parents, consult our media literacy guide, which was built in partnership with @UNESCO, here. We’re absolutely committed to playing our part and will continue to provide substantive updates as this situation evolves.

That’s why we announced our plan last fall to once again seek input from around the globe on how we will address synthetic and manipulated media. Today, we’re sharing what we learned and how it shaped the update to The Twitter Rules, how we’ll treat this content when we identify it, as well as something new you’ll see in Twitter as part of this change. What did we learn? Through a survey on our initial draft of this rule, as well as Tweets that included the hashtag #TwitterPolicyFeedback, we gathered more than 6,500 responses from people around the world. We also consulted with a diverse, global group of civil society and academic experts on our draft approach. Overall, people recognize the threat that misleading altered media poses and want Twitter to do something about it. Here are some of the top-line findings: Twitter should give me more information: Globally, more than 70 percent of people who use Twitter said “taking no action” on misleading altered media would be unacceptable. Respondents were nearly unanimous in their support for Twitter providing additional information or context on Tweets that have this type of media. This type of content should be labeled: Nearly 9 out of 10 individuals said placing warning labels next to significantly altered content would be acceptable. That is about as many who said it would be acceptable to alert people before they Tweet misleading altered media. Compared to placing warning labels, respondents were somewhat less supportive of removing or hiding Tweets that contained misleading altered media. For example, 55 percent of those surveyed in the US said it would be acceptable to remove all of such media. When asked to give their open-ended thoughts about the proposed rule, people who opposed removal of all altered media talked about the impact on free expression and censorship. If it is likely to cause harm, it should be removed: More than 90 percent of people who shared feedback support Twitter removing this content when it’s clear that it is intended to cause certain types of harm. There should be enforcement action when sharing this content: More than 75 percent of people believe accounts that share misleading altered media should face enforcement action. Enforcement actions could include people on Twitter having to delete their Tweet or having their account suspended. What’s the new rule? You may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm. In addition, we may label Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand the media’s authenticity and to provide additional context. We’ll use the following criteria to consider Tweets and media for labeling or removal under this rule: Are the media synthetic or manipulated? In determining whether media have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated, some factors we consider include: —Whether the content has been substantially edited in a manner that fundamentally alters its composition, sequence, timing, or framing; —Any visual or auditory information (such as new video frames, overdubbed audio, or modified subtitles) that has been added or removed; and —Whether media depicting a real person has been fabricated or simulated. Are the media shared in a deceptive manner? We’ll also consider whether the context in which media are shared could result in confusion or misunderstanding or suggests a deliberate intent to deceive people about the nature or origin of the content, for example by falsely claiming that it depicts reality. We also assess the context provided alongside media, for example: —The text of the Tweet accompanying or within the media —Metadata associated with the media —Information on the profile of the person sharing the media —Websites linked in the profile of the person sharing the media, or in the Tweet sharing the media Is the content likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm? Tweets that share synthetic and manipulated media are subject to removal under this policy if they are likely to cause harm. Some specific harms we consider include: —Threats to the physical safety of a person or group —Risk of mass violence or widespread civil unrest —Threats to the privacy or ability of a person or group to freely express themselves or participate in civic events, such as: stalking or unwanted and obsessive attention;targeted content that includes tropes, epithets, or material that aims to silence someone; voter suppression or intimidation What will this look like on Twitter? If we believe that media shared in a Tweet have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated, we will provide additional context on the Tweet. This means we may: Apply a label to the Tweet; Show a warning to people before they Retweet or like the Tweet; Reduce the visibility of the Tweet on Twitter and/or prevent it from being recommended; and/or Provide additional explanations or clarifications, as available, such as a landing page with more context. In most cases, we will take all of the above actions on Tweets we label. Our teams will start labeling Tweets with this type of media on March 5, 2020. This will be a challenge and we will make errors along the way — we appreciate the patience. However, we’re committed to doing this right. Updating our rules in public and with democratic participation will continue to be core to our approach. We’re working to serve the public conversation, and doing our work openly and with the people who use our service."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/events/2020/how-the-chiefs-superbowl-victory-played-out-on-twitter","date":"2020-01-02T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events"],"title":"How the @Chiefs #SuperBowl victory played out on Twitter","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible","date":"2020-01-01T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Accessibility","Product","Diversity","Company"],"title":"Making Twitter more accessible","text":"Serving the public conversation means continuously taking steps to make Twitter more accessible – from what we build to the internal programs and policies we implement globally – and this must include people with disabilities.

So what are we doing to accelerate this necessary change? We’re introducing two new teams we’re building to focus on this work: 1) the Accessibility Center of Excellence and 2) the Experience Accessibility Team, which will focus specifically on the features and products on Twitter. The Accessibility Center for Excellence will set goals, drive progress, consult and partner with groups across our core business functions to help make aspects of Twitter more accessible. This includes everything from accessibility in our office spaces to our marketing and communications strategies, to legal and policy standards, and more. The Experience Accessibility Team will work within our product org on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on the service. They’ll work in tandem with the Accessibility Center for Excellence to ensure we’re held accountable in identifying and filling accessibility gaps throughout the product development lifecycle. Beyond staffing our teams, we’re already working to add automated captions to audio and video by early 2021. This lays the foundation for a longer-term roadmap that invests broadly in media accessibility throughout our service. We’ve partnered with external groups and over the coming months we’ll be gathering feedback from people with disabilities via interviews, surveys, and doing remote usability studies of new prototypes. While this is underway, we’ll continue to test related media features. We know we need to do more to make our service accessible and we will – you can follow along on all of our accessibility product updates at @TwitterA11y. While we’ve outlined new initiatives happening across Accessibility @Twitter, we are continuing to engage with our Tweeps, partners, and people on this important topic. Our business resource groups, like @TwitterAble, remain key voices in our cultural accessibility and product efforts, and we’ll keep hosting public forums like our “Disability in UX” event led by @TwitterA11y. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made to make Twitter more accessible – both as a company and as a service – but we know there’s a lot more work ahead to ensure we’re truly inclusive for people with disabilities.

Recent conversation around our photo cropping methods brought this to the forefront, and over the past week, we’ve been reviewing the way we test for bias in our systems and discussing ways we can improve how we display images on Twitter. So, while there’s a lot still to do, today we want to share how we’re developing a solution for each of these areas. How We Tested Our System We tested the existing machine learning (ML) system that decides how to crop images before bringing it to Twitter, but we should’ve published how we did it at the same time so the analysis could be externally reproducible. This was an oversight. The image cropping system relies on saliency, which predicts where people might look first. For our initial bias analysis, we tested pairwise preference between two demographic groups (White-Black, White-Indian, White-Asian and male-female). In each trial, we combined two faces into the same image, with their order randomized, then computed the saliency map over the combined image. Then, we located the maximum of the saliency map, and recorded which demographic category it landed on. We repeated this 200 times for each pair of demographic categories and evaluated the frequency of preferring one over the other. While our analyses to date haven’t shown racial or gender bias, we recognize that the way we automatically crop photos means there is a potential for harm. We should’ve done a better job of anticipating this possibility when we were first designing and building this product. We are currently conducting additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing, are committed to sharing our findings, and are exploring ways to open-source our analysis so that others can help keep us accountable. Changes to Come We are prioritizing work to decrease our reliance on ML-based image cropping by giving people more visibility and control over what their images will look like in a Tweet. We’ve started exploring different options to see what will work best across the wide range of images people Tweet every day. We hope that giving people more choices for image cropping and previewing what they’ll look like in the Tweet composer may help reduce the risk of harm. Going forward, we are committed to following the “what you see is what you get” principles of design, meaning quite simply: the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet. There may be some exceptions to this, such as photos that aren’t a standard size or are really long or wide. In those cases, we’ll need to experiment with how we present the photo in a way that doesn’t lose the creator’s intended focal point or take away from the integrity of the photo. Bias in ML systems is an industry-wide issue, and one we’re committed to improving on Twitter. We’re aware of our responsibility, and want to work towards making it easier for everyone to understand how our systems work. While no system can be completely free of bias, we’ll continue to minimize bias through deliberate and thorough analysis, and share updates as we progress in this space. There’s lots of work to do, but we’re grateful for everyone who spoke up and shared feedback on this. We’re eager to improve and will share additional updates as we have them."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/building-a-real-time-golf-leaderboard","date":"2019-12-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["API","Events","Partners","Insights"],"title":"Building a real-time golf leaderboard","text":"As more and more people are enjoying opened golf courses right now, we want to share some learnings from the Twitter Data Partner Cup that we hosted last fall. The format was a 'shotgun scramble' golf tournament in Los Angeles, CA meant to celebrate a few of Twitter’s Data partners and their customers for a day of fun on the links. If you are unfamiliar with the scramble format, each member of a four-person team tees off and the team repeatedly picks the best shot until the hole is completed. With a 'shotgun' start, there are 18 teams that begin play simultaneously – each starting on a different hole. For example, team 8 starts on hole 8. With most non-professional golf tournaments, the team scores are typically not known until the very end when the scorecards are turned in. How cool would it be to get real-time score updates during the game? We saw this as an opportunity to create a tool that would allow for a live scoring system. This system could enable teams to submit their scores from the course as holes are completed, and the compiled scores could be shared via a live leaderboard, helping to fuel the competition. As members of the Twitter Developer Relations team, we felt up for the challenge to build such a scoring system with the Twitter platform. We began prototyping a solution during a company hackweek. We first sketched out a technical design for a system where: Team scores are submitted via Direct Messages. When a score arrives, the score is stored, a new leaderboard is generated, and that leaderboard is immediately sent back to the scorer via a Direct Message. When a score arrives that’s under par, a congratulatory Tweet is posted. Event \"marshals\" are enabled to post leaderboard Tweets as the event unfolded. It became clear that we'd be building a Twitter chatbot, where private messages (Direct Messages) provide the main communication channel, while also having the ability to communicate with public Tweets. When we thought about the features we'd want for such an app, these surfaced as the main features: Scores are submitted via Direct Messages using a simple format that encodes the team number, the number of the hole just completed, along with the score. Each team has a score keeper, and this player is taught how to submit scores. When a player submits a score, they should receive an updated leaderboard via Direct Message. This serves as confirmation that the score was received and accepted. The system needed the ability to support updating an incorrect score. Mistakes will happen. If the score is below par, a Tweet is automatically posted to publicly congratulate the team. #BirdieAlert The app should support a set of admin-level commands that only event marshals have access to. For example, these marshals decide when to publicly Tweet the leaderboard, typically every 20-30 minutes. We did not want to Tweet a leaderboard every time a score is submitted since a total of 324 scores are expected. The leaderboard should look good and be easy to understand. Building a leaderboard graphic took considerably more effort than expected. See below for the final output. With these design goals in mind, we began to build with the following Twitter API endpoints, which provide the foundation for any Twitter chatbot: Account Activity API - We knew we were building a 'listening' application, and we needed to listen for incoming Direct Messages with scores. The webhook-based Account Activity API (AAA) provides these real-time listening skills. The AAA provides the bridge between your web app and Twitter. We created the @HackerScorer account to host the chatbot and subscribed that account to the AAA service. Direct Message API - When a score was received, the chatbot was designed to immediately respond to the scorer with an updated leaderboard in a Direct Messages. So, we knew the Direct Messages API would provide the fundamental 'submit score' communication channel. POST statuses/update - The @HackerScorer account needed to Tweet when the event marshals triggered a leaderboard update. The system was also designed to send a congratulatory Tweet automatically when a score arrived that was under par. Even though we were testing and debugging up until the night before the event (like any hackweek project), we are happy to report the leaderboard app worked nearly flawlessly. The ability to see how other teams were scoring added to the excitement as the event progressed. Seeing notifications of other team's subpar holes added to the \"what's happening now?\" experience. The main day-of-show challenge was spotty cell coverage out on the course. It's definitely recommended to test coverage at the event location beforehand. Also, in some cases, there clearly was not enough training on how to submit scores correctly the first time (we will not name names). Finally, we built the app to Tweet only when teams scored a Birdie (one under par). While Eagles (two under par) were not expected, they happened several times and were not Tweeted about. More sadly, there was a hole-in-one that went completely unacknowledged in real-time. Next time, we’ll be sure to account for these rare events and notify the audience! Not into golf? That's OK. Keep in mind that the framework used here to support a live golf scoring system is general enough for other use cases. This design could be used for a variety of other scenarios like scavenger hunts and other sports tournaments, such as soccer and bowling. Beyond shared sporting events, these patterns can support private polls by receiving private votes and rankings and publicly sharing compiled results at their completion. The next time you’re planning a tournament or friendly game, think of Twitter. The @HackerScorer chatbot was developed in Python using Flask. See the project's GitHub repository for more details. If you want to learn more about how this live scoring app was developed and deployed, see our code-driven blog post about this prototype. This blog post is split into four parts, focusing on getting started with Twitter chatbots, designing the chatbot experience, developing the database-driven scoring system, and generating leaderboard graphics in real-time."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/adding-more-context-to-trends","date":"2019-12-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Adding more context to Trends","text":"Trends show what everyone is talking about right now. But too often, we look at one word or phrase trending on Twitter and ask, “why is this trending?” That question was actually Tweeted over half a million times over the last year! It should be easier to understand what’s being said immediately. Throughout Twitter, we've been working to bring people more context on what’s happening with labels on Tweets and accounts as well as curated pages (aka Moments) and related articles on trends. To help with this, we’re adding pinned Tweets and descriptions on trends to help explain why something is trending. Sometimes the right Tweet can help make sense of a trend. Starting today, some trends will have a representative Tweet pinned to them to give you more insight about a trend right away. A combination of algorithms and our curation team determine if a Tweet represents a trend by evaluating if the Tweet is very reflective of the trend and popular. Our algorithms are designed to identify representative Tweets that aren’t potentially abusive, spam, or posted by accounts trying to take advantage of our system. Representative Tweets on trends can be found on Twitter for iOS and Android now. We’re working to bring them to twitter.com soon too. In the coming weeks, you should see brief descriptions added to some trends as well to help add context to the trend. Descriptions will provide straightforward, clearly sourced context around why something is trending. Descriptions are developed by our curation team and follow their guidelines. Descriptions on trends will be found on twitter.com and Twitter for iOS and Android. Representative Tweets and descriptions on trends will be available in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Egypt, France, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. To bring more clarity to the conversation, we hope to add more context to more trends over time. To be clear, we know there is more work to do to improve trends and the context updates we’re announcing today are just a small step in the right direction. There is more we can do to help people understand why something is trending and to provide transparency around how something trends.

It’s been an exciting, loud and engaging few weeks, where Europeans not only came out in force at polling stations, but also on Twitter. To drive engagement across all official EU languages, we launched two special emojis for the occasion - #EP2019 and #EUelections2019. From Thursday to Sunday — when voters from 28 Member States went to the polls — EU election-related conversations amassed an incredible 2.1 million Tweets collectively, including those using #EP2019, #EUelections2019 and #ThisTimeImVoting. Relatedly, voter turnout was way up. Overall, since the campaign began in February, there was 6.2 million election-related Tweets, marking a 273% increase in Tweet volume on the previous EU elections. Twitter was the conversational platform of choice for those who wanted to engage on the issue for the 2019 EU elections. Unsurprisingly, Brexit-related issues attracted a huge level of conversation and engagement with over 1.5 million Tweets posted on the topic over the election weekend alone, with 221k of those using #Brexit. In terms of candidates who are front-runners for the next President of the EU Commission, most mentioned during the election weekend were @TimmermansEU, @ManfredWeber and @SkaKeller with the most frequently mentioned political parties being; European Green Party; European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The rise in Twitter conversation involving the European Green Party is one that is certainly reflective of the #GreenWave across Europe in terms of voting patterns. Engagement was also extremely high for the #TellEurope Eurovision debate, with 2.5m views on Twitter’s livestream of the event from the Parliament’s @Europarl_EN account. The much-loved #DogsAtPollingStations also proved popular, with almost 22,000 Tweets between Thursday and Friday. Here’s a snippet of what was shared: On Sunday, when 21 countries went to the polling stations, Europe was alight with election 2019 conversation as demonstrated by our Tweet velocity heatmap. The map shows the geographical distribution of conversation across the region, including spikes as people expressed their democratic participation in every individual Member State. As the figures show, the depth of conversation around the #EUelections was significantly higher (273%) than the previous election cycle, highlighting how Twitter is increasingly utilized by citizens to express themselves on the issues that matter to their everyday lives. To help protect these critical online conversations, we took a number of proactive steps specific to these elections. These included establishing an elections integrity team to monitor trends and behaviours; rolling out a new tool to allow people to report deliberately misleading election-related content; and launching a political campaign ads policy to provide more insight into electioneering ads. In February, we said Twitter would work diligently to ensure it would be the world’s window into the EU election conversation. Between selfies at count centres, breaking news alerts and the intense back-and-forth of the Brexit debate, the conversation was dynamic, extraordinarily varied and most importantly, created an online town square to unite voters around key issues relevant to them. Serving and protecting the health of the public conversation continues to be Twitter’s key priority. We’ll continue working to protect conversations on the service, particularly around election cycles, by investing in technology, developing new policies, and building meaningful partnerships to further our understanding of the political and social context within which Twitter operates."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2019/go-live-with-guests","date":"2019-05-28T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Go live with guests!","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/addressing-the-abuse-of-tech-to-spread-terrorist-and-extremist-c","date":"2019-05-14T22:00:00.000Z","tags":["Health","Policy","Safety","Company"],"title":"Addressing the abuse of tech to spread terrorist and extremist content","text":"In addition to our commitment to the Christchurch Call, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon commit to the following: Five Individual Actions: 1. Terms of Use. We commit to updating our terms of use, community standards, codes of conduct, and acceptable use policies to expressly prohibit the distribution of terrorist and violent extremist content. We believe this is important to establish baseline expectations for users and to articulate a clear basis for removal of this content from our platforms and services and suspension or closure of accounts distributing such content. 2. User Reporting of Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content. We commit to establishing one or more methods within our online platforms and services for users to report or flag inappropriate content, including terrorist and violent extremist content. We will ensure that the reporting mechanisms are clear, conspicuous, and easy to use, and provide enough categorical granularity to allow the company to prioritize and act promptly upon notification of terrorist or violent extremist content. 3. Enhancing Technology. We commit to continuing to invest in technology that improves our capability to detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content online, including the extension or development of digital fingerprinting and AI based technology solutions. 4. Livestreaming. We commit to identifying appropriate checks on livestreaming, aimed at reducing the risk of disseminating terrorist and violent extremist content online. These may include enhanced vetting measures (such as streamer ratings or scores, account activity, or validation processes) and moderation of certain livestreaming events where appropriate. Checks on livestreaming necessarily will be tailored to the context of specific livestreaming services, including the type of audience, the nature or character of the livestreaming service, and the likelihood of exploitation. 5. Transparency Reports. We commit to publishing on a regular basis transparency reports regarding detection and removal of terrorist or violent extremist content on our online platforms and services and ensuring that the data is supported by a reasonable and explainable methodology. Four Collaborative Actions: 1. Share Technology Development. We commit working collaboratively across industry, governments, educational institutions, and NGOs to develop a shared understanding of the contexts in which terrorist and violent extremist content is published and to improve technology to detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively and efficiently. This will include: Work to create robust shared data sets to accelerate machine learning and AI and sharing insights and learnings from the data. Development of open source or other shared tools to detect and remove terrorist or violent extremist content. Enablement of all companies, large and small, to contribute to the collective effort and to better address detection and removal of this content on their platforms and services. 2. Crisis Protocols. We commit to working collaboratively across industry, governments, and NGOs to create a protocol for responding to emerging or active events, on an urgent basis, so relevant information can be quickly and efficiently shared, processed, and acted upon by all stakeholders with minimal delay. This includes the establishment of incident management teams that coordinate actions and broadly distribute information that is in the public interest. 3. Education. We commit to working collaboratively across industry governments, educational institutions, and NGOs to help understand and educate the public about terrorist and extremist violent content online. This educating and reminding users about how to report or otherwise not contribute to the spread of this content online. 4. Combatting Hate and Bigotry. We commit to working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hate online. This includes providing greater support for relevant research — with an emphasis on the impact of online hate on offline discrimination and violence — and supporting capacity and capability of NGOs working to challenge hate and promote pluralism and respect online."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/twitter-transparency-report-2019","date":"2019-01-30T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Health","Policy","Privacy","Safety","Security","Company"],"title":"15th Transparency Report: Increase in proactive enforcement on accounts","text":"We’re continually striving to be more proactive and open in the work we do to serve the public conversation on Twitter. Part of that effort is our biannual Twitter Transparency Report, which we’ve produced since July 2012 to share global trends across a number of areas of our enforcement on Twitter, including the Twitter Rules and legal requests we receive. The report is ever-evolving. For the first time, we’re incorporating data and insights regarding impersonation policy enforcement, as well as state-backed information operations datasets that were previously released to the public to empower research and awareness of these campaigns. Since the last Twitter Transparency Report, we’ve continued to further invest in proactive technology to positively and directly impact people’s conversations on the service. Here are key highlights from that work, which relate to the latest reporting period (January 1 to June 30, 2019)*: More than 50% of Tweets we take action on for abuse are now proactively surfaced using technology, rather than relying on reports to Twitter; 105% increase in accounts actioned by Twitter (locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules); Continuing a year-on-year trend, a 30% decrease in accounts suspended for the promotion of terrorism; and 67% more global legal demands, originating from 49 different countries. *All figures compared to the last reporting period. Twitter Rules enforcement Our continued investment in proprietary technology is steadily reducing the burden on people to report to us. For example, more than 50% of Tweets we take action on for abuse are now being surfaced using technology. This compares to just 20% a year ago. Additionally, due to a combination of our increased focus on proactively surfacing potentially violative content for human review and the inclusion of impersonation data for the first time, we saw a 105% increase in accounts locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules. Specific policy content areas: Private information: We saw a 48% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of our private information policies. We suspended 119% more accounts than the previous reporting period. This increase may be attributed to the launch of improvements to our reporting flow that make it easier to report private information, as well as changes to our internal enforcement processes which permit bystanders to report potential private information violations for review. Sensitive media: We saw a 37% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of our sensitive media policies. We actioned 41% more accounts. Hateful conduct: There was a 48% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of our hateful conduct policies. We actioned 133% more accounts compared to the last reporting period. Abuse: We saw a 22% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of our abuse policies. We took action on 68% more accounts compared to the last reporting period. Impersonation: Impersonation is when an account poses as another person, brand, or organization in a confusing or deceptive manner and is prohibited by the Twitter Rules. During this reporting period, we took enforcement action on 124,339 accounts for violating our impersonation policy. Platform manipulation We also continue to focus on deterring potentially spammy accounts at the time of account creation; often before their first Tweet. However, our enforcement actions tend to fluctuate for a variety of reasons, often due to the type of spam. This reporting period, our anti-spam challenges — where we ask people to provide a phone number or email address or fill in a ReCAPTCHA code to verify there is a human behind an account — fell by nearly 50%. Removal of terrorist content A total of 115,861 accounts were suspended for violations related to the promotion of terrorism this reporting period, down 30% from the previous reporting period. This continues a year-on-year decrease in the number of accounts promoting terrorist content on Twitter as we take more comprehensive enforcement action using our technology and strengthen partnerships with our peers. Of those suspensions, 87% consisted of accounts we proactively flagged using internal, proprietary removal tools. Removal of child sexual exploitation content During this reporting period, we suspended a total of 244,188 accounts for violations related to child sexual exploitation. Of the unique accounts suspended, 91% were surfaced by a combination of technology solutions (including PhotoDNA and internal, proprietary tools). Legal requests In addition to enforcing the Twitter Rules, we also may take action in response to legal requests. Copyright violations: We received a 101% increase in DMCA takedown notices since our last report. However, many were incomplete or not actionable. We continue to see a high volume of fraudulent DMCA reports from Turkey and Japan, while fraudulent reports from Brazil also continue to increase. Trademark notices: We saw a 39% increase in the total number of trademark notices received since our last report. The increase is likely due to an influx of reports that failed to provide sufficient information to take any action on our part. Information requests (legal requests for account information): Information requests from the United States continue to make up the highest percentage of legal requests for account information. During this reporting period, 29% of all global requests for account information originated within the United States. National security requests: At this time we are only able to share information about the number of National Security Letters (NSLs) received which are no longer subject to non-disclosure orders. We believe it is much more meaningful to publish these actual numbers than reporting in the bands authorized per the USA Freedom Act. Our litigation in the case Twitter v. Barr continues. During this reporting period, we notified people affected by three additional NSLs after the gag orders were lifted. As reflected in the report, non-disclosure orders for 17 total NSLs have been lifted to date. Twitter is committed to continuing to use the legal mechanism available to us to request a judicial review of these gag orders. Removal requests (legal requests for content removal)*: Compared to the previous reporting period, we received roughly 67% more legal requests to remove content, originating from 49 different countries. Of the requests received, 80% of the volume originated from Japan, Russia, and Turkey. We withheld content in a country 2,457 times, at either an account or Tweet level. *We continue to publish these legal requests when we take action directly to the Lumen Database, a partnership with Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. We remain deeply committed to transparency at Twitter — it continues to be one of our key guiding principles. This commitment is reflected in the evolution and expansion of the report in recent years: It now includes dedicated sections on platform manipulation and spam, our Twitter Rules enforcement, and state-backed information operations we’ve previously removed from the service. This report reflects not only the evolution of the public conversation on our service but the work we do every day to protect and support the people who use Twitter.

A somewhat radical strategy at the time, Comcast’s move to social proved to be the first step in a journey towards embedding social into their customer experience. Today, millions of people come to Twitter to express their thoughts, experiences and opinions - making Twitter one of the top channels where customers engage with brands, including airing their customer service woes. Offering some level of social customer service just makes good business sense. In my work, I spend a lot of time talking to and educating companies on the potential of Twitter data. When it comes to social customer service I’ve observed that most companies fall into three stages of maturity. Many companies begin providing social customer service almost accidentally, as a result of their social media marketing efforts. Customers find their social marketing channels and concerns flow in. Conscientious marketers do their best to direct these incoming service issues to the right people so they can close the loop with a response. But a lack of clear ownership means messages occasionally fall through the cracks, and there is very little performance tracking on customer service interactions let alone service-level agreements (SLAs). The focus tends to be on “best-effort” and it’s common practice to deflect the incoming customer service enquiries to other support channels such as phone or email. Companies at this emerging stage of maturity would benefit most from clear guidelines accompanied by staff training for interacting with customers on social media. In addition, a good social media management tool would go a long way in preventing things from falling through the cracks; improving social media response times while also facilitating better cross-team collaboration. At this stage of their social care journey, businesses have fully adopted social customer service as an equal to established channels such as phone, email or chat. With clear guidelines in place, one or more trained agents are dedicated to resolving social enquiries on the originating platform (versus diverting to phone or email). SLAs such as First Response Time and Time to Resolution are in place and monitored. A social care tool is in use and with it, defined routing and approval workflows. Many businesses stay at this stage and feel satisfied that they are getting the job of social customer care done. They are responsive and their customers are appreciative. Why change anything? But, by not looking to further innovate and mature their program, they may be missing out on an opportunity to create deeper value for both their customers and their business. In the third and most advanced stage of social care maturity, businesses shift from social adoption to social innovation. They are proactively promoting social (including messaging) as a channel where customers can receive expedited customer service. Customer experience delivery is driven by ‘social engagement centers’. Part marketing and part care, these “centers” are designed to not only resolve customer issues but to also proactively engage with the public on topics and events of relevance to the business. They blend human interaction and automation (such as bots) into a unified service experience and are able to collect real-time Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) feedback. Their social media suite is integrated with other critical systems allowing for more holistic customer visibility to enable personalization. They know who their customers are, the issues they’ve had in the past and how they’d like to be treated. Businesses in this stage see their approach to social as a true differentiator and source of competitive differentiation. They have adopted an innovation mindset and are quick to adopt best practices and benchmark themselves against their peers. Crucially, they have senior leadership buy-in who practice what they preach, actively engaging with customers. Over ten years have passed since @ComcastCares went live. Their social care experiment has grown from handling a few thousand conversations a year to well over 50k a month, and social customer service has become an integral part of the company’s customer experience.

In the past, we’ve allowed certain Tweets that violated our rules to remain on Twitter because they were in the public’s interest, but it wasn’t clear when and how we made those determinations. To fix that, we’re introducing a new notice that will provide additional clarity in these situations, and sharing more on when and why we’ll use it. Serving the public conversation includes providing the ability for anyone to talk about what matters to them; this can be especially important when engaging with government officials and political figures. By nature of their positions these leaders have outsized influence and sometimes say things that could be considered controversial or invite debate and discussion. A critical function of our service is providing a place where people can openly and publicly respond to their leaders and hold them accountable. With this in mind, there are certain cases where it may be in the public’s interest to have access to certain Tweets, even if they would otherwise be in violation of our rules. On the rare occasions when this happens, we'll place a notice – a screen you have to click or tap through before you see the Tweet – to provide additional context and clarity. We’ll also take steps to make sure the Tweet is not algorithmically elevated on our service, to strike the right balance between enabling free expression, fostering accountability, and reducing the potential harm caused by these Tweets. Who does this apply to? We will only consider applying this notice on Tweets from accounts that meet the following criteria. The account must: Be or represent a government/elected official, be running for public office, or be considered for a government position (i.e., next in line, awaiting confirmation, named successor to an appointed position); Have more than 100,000 followers; and Be verified. That said, there are cases, such as direct threats of violence or calls to commit violence against an individual, that are unlikely to be considered in the public interest. What will the notice look like? The notice will be immediately visible in your home timeline and across other areas like search. How will we decide when to use this notice? A cross-functional team including Trust and Safety, Legal, Public Policy and regional teams will determine if the Tweets are a matter of public interest based on the criteria listed above and the following considerations: The immediacy and severity of potential harm from the rule violation, with an emphasis on ensuring physical safety; Whether preserving a Tweet will allow others to hold the government official, candidate for public office, or appointee accountable for their statements; Whether there are other sources of information about this statement available for the public to stay informed; If removal would inadvertently hide context or prevent people from understanding an issue of public concern; and If the Tweet provides a unique context or perspective not available elsewhere that is necessary to a broader discussion. You can learn more about our decision making principles here In instances where a Tweet violates our rules and our review doesn’t find that it would be in the public interest to leave it up, we will require the account owner to remove the Tweet. Either way, this notice will make our decision-making clearer. What happens to the Tweet that gets this notice placed on it? When a Tweet has this notice placed on it, it will feature less prominently on Twitter, and not appear in: Safe search Timeline when switched to Top Tweets Live events pages Recommended Tweet push notifications Notifications tab Explore Limited engagements – Likes, Replies and Retweets will be disabled to reduce the reach of Tweets that violate our rules. Retweeting with comment (Quote Tweeting) will remain so people can share the Tweet with additional context. This notice won’t be applied to any Tweets sent before today and, given the conditions outlined above, it’s unlikely you'll encounter it often. We cannot predict the first time it will be used, but we wanted to give you more information about this new notice before you come across it on Twitter. Over time, public interest and how it’s defined on Twitter may change as we observe different types of behavior. We’ll continue to evaluate how our rules and enforcement actions can be clearer and keep working to make our decision-making easier to understand. *Updated on October 15, 2019: This post was updated to include additional product updates."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/events/2019/what-to-expect-from-twitter-aheadoffirst-demdebate","date":"2019-01-25T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Elections","Government","Events"],"title":"What to expect from Twitter ahead of the first #DemDebate","text":"It’s always an election year on Twitter. In fact, this year alone, voters have taken part in the global Twitter conversation about elections in the European Union, Australia, India, and Indonesia. We take the learnings from every election — including the 2018 US Midterms — and use them to improve the experience of people who use Twitter and enhance our election integrity safeguards. As the US Democratic presidential primary debates kick off this week, here’s a rundown of how you can take part in the Twitter conversation and the steps we are taking to ensure you can trust the information you see. How do I watch the #DemDebate on Twitter? On Wednesday and Thursday, June 24-25, starting at 9 p.m. ET, the debates will be broadcast live on Twitter in English and Spanish via @NBCNews and @TelemundoNews. #DemDebate is the official hashtag for the debates — you can search for it or tap it anywhere on Twitter to find the live broadcast. Check the top of your home timeline on mobile: If you follow @NBCNews or @TelemundoNews or are interested in politics, you’ll see the live broadcast there. Plus, we’ll include a ‘set reminder’ button before each debate on the #DemDebate event page, which you can select to receive an alert when it starts. How is Twitter prioritizing a healthy election conversation? We have a cross-functional team focused on election integrity efforts that aims to foster an environment conducive to healthy, meaningful conversation on Twitter and address threats posed by hostile foreign and domestic actors. New rules Ahead of the US midterms last fall, we updated the Twitter Rules around several key issues impacting the integrity of elections across the globe. The rules address: (1) fake accounts engaged in a variety of malicious behaviors, (2) removing accounts that deliberately mimic or are intended to replace accounts we have previously suspended for violating our rules, and (3) the distribution of hacked material that contains private information or trade secrets, or could put people in harm’s way. Additionally, earlier this year, we strengthened our rules against deliberate attempts to mislead voters to now explicitly prohibit manipulating or interfering in the election process. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress voter turnout or mislead people about when, where, or how to vote. Fighting spam and manipulation Communal spaces on Twitter (like search, hashtags, and trends) are the most common areas where people go to find the latest information about ongoing events and conversation outside of their home timeline and existing follower network. This is especially true during live events with a high volume of Tweets, like presidential debates. We know bad-faith actors can attempt to manipulate the content in these spaces, and our existing rules and algorithms are built to stay ahead of these attempts. Our policies ban misleading, deceptive, and spammy behavior and prohibit attempts to game trends or cause unrelated Tweets to appear in search results. In addition to these existing preventative systems, we will be protecting the integrity of the conversation around key topics and trends. Campaign outreach and partnerships To date, our public policy team has met and facilitated trainings with 20 presidential campaign teams and the Democratic National Committee, Republican National Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and National Republican Senatorial Committee to share information on account security, content best practices, our advertising policies, and Twitter’s reporting procedures. We have existing, open lines of communication with the US Department of Homeland Security, state elections directors, and the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force. Public archive of information operations Last October, we launched the first archive of potential state-backed information operations we’ve seen on Twitter. It is our fundamental belief that these accounts should be made public and searchable so members of the public, governments, and researchers can investigate, learn, and build media literacy capacities for the future. We updated this public archive in January, as recently as a few weeks ago, and will continue to do so if we identify state-backed activity targeting conversations on Twitter. We also produced an in-depth review of our efforts to protect the public conversation around the 2018 US Midterm Elections, which notes that what we saw was more domestic than foreign in nature. Where can I find debate insights and data? Around the debates, @TwitterGov will share insights and information about how the conversation is unfolding on Twitter. This will include data after each debate night like the most Tweeted about moments, on-stage candidates, and US politicians. How do I identify and learn about ads? It’s very likely that you will see Promoted Tweets containing political or election-related content on Twitter during debates. Twitter’s policies require that accounts running these kind of advertisements become certified as political campaigning or issue advertisers, which requires that their Promoted Tweets contain more explicit identification, and that they consent to increased transparency on their advertising campaigns’ targeting and spend data. We believe this transparency is vital, and we continue to support the Honest Ads Act. All of the data on political campaigning and issue advertising is publicly available in Twitter’s Ads Transparency Center. *** Twitter exists to serve the public conversation, and people must have confidence in the integrity of the information found on the service, especially information relevant to elections and the democratic process. Our efforts to foster healthy, meaningful conversations on Twitter during the entirety of the US presidential election are ongoing, and we will continue to update the public via @Policy, @TwitterSafety, and @TwitterGov."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2019/customers-are-talking-are-you-listening-twitter-blog","date":"2019-01-24T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Your customers are talking. Are you listening?","text":"I think we can all agree, the digital revolution is over. By that I mean the shift from analog to digital is fully underway and there’s no way to unring the technology bell. Think about it. More than half the world is online with more people connecting every day. People everywhere are online, blending their work and personal lives while searching, reading, watching, playing, listening and connecting to share experiences, opinions and information - every minute of every day. Consider these numbers published by TNW earlier this year: 57% of the world is online where on average they spend almost 7 hours of the day 45% of the world are social media users 2.8B people are shopping online, spending almost $3B/year ($634 each) Over 95% of consumers say they are at least somewhat influenced by what other people say about brands on social media If you’re a customer experience (CX) expert, take note - these are your customers. And, their move online has fundamentally changed how they interact with your brand - sharing their thoughts, preferences and experiences at every stage of the customer journey - and you may be missing all of it. Status quo customer experience and Voice of the Customer programs chug along - trying to integrate new data sources while relying on tried and true traditional research methods - surveys, focus groups and interviews. By overlooking a wealth of untapped social data, your picture of your customer only grows murkier. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Imagine getting an unprecedented view of your customer through realtime, unprompted and authentic reactions to your brand, surfacing what’s important now as well as who and what is influencing them. And, imagine putting those insights to work to respond to your customers’ needs and shape their experience for the better, winning their approval and loyalty. People around the world are sharing hundreds of millions of Tweets every day, making Twitter the world’s largest publicly available searchable archive of consumer thoughts, experiences and opinions. You can tap into and harness those conversations through social listening and monitoring. Combined with your other data sources, those tweets paint a more accurate picture of your customers. Not only can this newfound understanding catch an issue before it becomes a crisis, but it can also lead to new products and services, customer retention insights, process improvements and more. All ultimately driving towards the holy grail of CX, increased customer satisfaction scores. We’ve been thinking a lot about how Twitter data can contribute to CX programs and I’ll be sharing some of those thoughts in upcoming posts. In the meantime, if you’re looking for inspiration, check out data.twitter.com for case studies that illustrate the power of social listening.

These complementary commitments intersect when we discuss media and information literacy. We want to empower the people who use our service to critically engage with the content they see. That’s why today, to mark the beginning of @UNESCO’s Global Media and Information Literacy Week 2019, we are launching a new handbook for educators, entitled Teaching and Learning with Twitter. Easy-to-read, informative and fun, the handbook primarily aims to help educators equip younger generations with media literacy skills, in turn enabling them to ask the right questions about content they engage with online, and critically analyse news and information they engage with on the service. The resource contains best practice guidelines on media literacy from UNESCO, and also a reading list curated by UNESCO’s program specialists, which is intended to guide educators through current teaching literature on this topic. To ensure it has a wide global reach, it will be initially translated into 9 different languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Arabic, Japanese, Swedish, Hindi, with future plans to translate it for other countries. We’ll also be distributing the resource to schools by leveraging our many partnerships across the world, for example through UNESCO’s network of relevant NGOs, state education agencies, and the European network of Safer Internet Centres. These efforts directly complement our policy development process on misinformation, specifically a new public comment period where you can provide feedback on upcoming policies we will be enacting to combat synthetic and manipulated media on our service. The digital classroom The Handbook also contains tips for educators and parents who want to unlock the benefits of Twitter as a learning tool in the classroom or at home, offering a helpful blend of theory, lesson plans, and case studies. Taking a holistic view of what it means to be able to be a good digital citizen, the handbook also contains sections which cover online safety, dealing with cyberbullying as an educator, and learning how to control your digital footprint. You can read it in more detail here. UNESCO and Twitter’s partnership The resource is a product of Twitter and UNESCO’s ongoing 18 month global partnership in this area, during which time we supported NGOs working on media and information literacy through our Ads For Good programme and supported their #MILClicks programme with a range of on-service activity, such as the serialisation of content from @MILClicks. Some of Twitter’s other activities include: Launching a dedicated emoji with accompanying hashtags #GlobalMILWeek, #ThinkBeforeSharing, and #ThinkBeforeClicking. Partnering with the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) to support Media Literacy Week in the United States using the hashtag #MediaLitWk. Offering Ads For Good grants to NGOs in @UNESCO’s network to help raise awareness for their work. VP of Public Policy, Government and Corporate Philanthropy at Twitter, Colin Crowell, states: “At Twitter, we are hopeful that this Handbook will have a tangible, beneficial impact on students across the world by helping educators impart critical information and skills to younger generations about how to navigate an increasingly complicated media environment. We deeply treasure our global partnership with UNESCO on media and information literacy and this project strongly benefits from UNESCO’s expertise in this area. We look forward to continued discussion and collaboration with UNESCO on how media and information literacy can be a defence — particularly in our young people — against disinformation and political propaganda around the world.” Moez Chakchouk, Assistant Director-General of UNESCO says: “Polarized information is driving a rise in hate and discrimination and is often amplified by inauthentic and malicious activity, while disinformation is compromising democracy and development. Promoting media and information literacy learning through social media platforms, such as this Twitter and UNESCO collaboration, could be far-reaching if systematically implemented and sustained.” He continues, “This is only the start of Twitter and UNESCO working together, we can expand our cooperation to give more impetus to promoting media and information literate citizenry in online spaces.”"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2019/when-it-comes-to-digital-transformation-start-with-the-customer","date":"2019-01-22T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"When it comes to digital transformation, start with the customer","text":"If it seems like everyone is talking about digital transformation these days, it’s with good reason. We are smack in the middle of an era like no other, characterized by exciting emerging and evolving technologies like cloud computing, mobile devices, artificial intelligence and the internet of things, all fueled by accelerating connectivity speeds. And, by taking advantage of technology to transform your business, you are motivated by outcomes like increased efficiency, greater profits and in some cases, new market opportunities. In parallel with this is another emerging phenomenon - the empowered consumer. People’s expectations for companies they do business with have changed. Concerns around issues like security, privacy, transparency, corporate social responsibility, immediacy, and personalization are finding a voice and informing people’s decisions about whether or not to do business with a company. And what’s more, they’re sharing those opinions well beyond their traditional social circles at home and at the office. Empowered and influential consumers can make or break your business. With the stakes so high, doesn’t it make sense that you put the customer at the center of your digital transformation strategy? Fortunately, it’s not that hard to find out what’s on customers’ minds. Technology and tools have empowered customers to communicate more easily and frequently than ever before. Well over half of the world is online where they’re spending an average of almost 7 hours every day. A portion of that time is spent communicating feedback (both prompted and unprompted) on the brands they encounter and care about, whether through writing reviews, completing surveys, or sharing opinions and experiences on social media platforms like Twitter. On Twitter, people share hundreds of millions of Tweets every day. And, at every stage of the customer journey, they are signalling satisfaction, concerns, frictions, and conflicts through their posts. They are not only expressing how they feel but why they feel that way. And, thanks to social listening tools, you can easily tap into these conversations, uncovering insights in real-time as well as historical patterns. When combined with other more traditional data from sources like surveys, focus groups or research, you can come closer than ever to knowing your customers on a deeper level and understanding their wants, needs and concerns. Consider some of the unintended consequences of digital transformation. In the case of US restaurant chain Shake Shack, they piloted a cashier-less, cash-free location. The self-serve kiosks promised to streamline customer service while reducing operating expenses. Unfortunately, the initiative was abandoned after 6 months. Why? It turns out Shake Shack customers like to customize their orders and the new human-free system didn’t permit this flexibility. And, believe it or not, many people still want to pay with cash. Could a deeper understanding of their customers have better set up this digital transformation initiative for success? Digital transformation in banking is another interesting example. Most of us have embraced the flexibility of online banking yet this transformation is still fraught with challenges. According to recent research from J.D. Power, 28% of US retail bank customers are now digital-only, but they are the least satisfied among all customer segments examined in the study. Digital-only experiences are not living up to customer expectations in the areas of communication and advice; products and fees; and new account opening. Could banks be better equipped to tackle these challenges with a deeper understanding of their digital customers? Whether it’s introducing automation or AI, shifting from bricks and mortar to digital, moving to the cloud or changing backend infrastructure, companies need to put customers at the center of their digital transformation strategy. Get it right and you will be the beneficiary of everything promised by digital transformation, including happier customers and lasting brand loyalty. Get it wrong and you risk the wrath of the empowered customer. Your customers are talking. Are you ready to start listening?

Doing it right, means considering a range of administrative, technical and cultural factors. The following checklist can help guide you to the best solution for your business. Customer Service Analytics Key care-focused metrics should include First Response Time, Average Handling Time and Time to Resolution. What metrics are available and will you be able to create custom metrics to align with your specific business needs? Approval Workflows Will you be able to create permission-based custom workflows for the purposes of agent collaboration, content approval and quality control? Customer Experience Auditing The ability to access and export the full conversation history and call agent actions is especially critical in highly regulated industries such as financial services. Case Management and Ticketing Can you create cases or tickets for follow-up and/or escalation? What about connectors or integrations to commonly used case management platforms? Customer Service Chatbots Can you integrate chatbots? Twitter has deployed a number of features to improve customer experiences such as welcome messages and quick replies. Will you have access to these features? Compliance and Information Security Whether it’s SOC2 accreditation or other certifications important in your industry and/or country. Conversation history Threading public tweets and private Direct Messages together into a conversation view provides valuable context should an issue need to be escalated or passed to another agent. Twitter has made it easy for brands to move a customer from a Tweet into a private message with the launch of Direct Message deep links. Credibility Specific industries tend to have their own needs when it comes to customer care. Does the vendor understand and have experience in your industry? Ask for case studies and customer references. CRM & ID Matching Can you add tags and notes to social profiles? How are these additions added to your CRM? Twitter allows brands to match user IDs to customer records under specific circumstances - if the user has expressly consented or the matching is being done based on publicly available data and/or data provided directly by the applicable Twitter user that an individual would reasonably expect to be used for that purpose. Data Access What are the relationships with the social networks being featured? Enterprise level? Whitelisted access to API feeds? These relationships matter, when it comes to your mission-critical customer care operation. Certified Twitter Official Partners can be found here https://partners.twitter.com/en. Customer Care Feedback Can you deploy CSAT and NPS surveys as well as track sentiment conversion? Twitter’s Customer Feedback feature enables people to privately share their opinions with a business after a service interaction. Will you have the option to access this feature? Integrations & pre-built Connectors Which third-party software integrations are important to you? If you can access them, how? Are they uni-directional, bi-directional or an iframe? What about custom integrations? Customer Knowledge Base Is there a built-in knowledge base for care agents with suggested answers based on the context of the message? What about connectors to your existing knowledge base or content management system? Onboarding What will the onboarding process look like, both for product training and the softer side of social care such as establishing an appropriate tone of voice? Routing & Prioritization How will social messages be routed and prioritized to appropriate care agents? There are many options including routing based on keywords, influencer score and CRM history. Don’t forget language-specific routing for localization and global coverage. Your customers are waiting for you on Twitter. Are you ready to join them?

To make this happen, we need to change how conversations work on our service. Currently, repliers can shift the topic or tone of a discussion and derail what you and your audience want to talk about. To give you more control over the conversations you start, we tested the option for you to hide replies to your Tweets. We learned that the feature is a useful new way to manage your conversations. Today, we’re making this available to everyone globally. Here’s how it works. Anyone can choose to hide replies to their Tweets. Everyone can see and engage with hidden replies by tapping the grey icon that will appear on the Tweets. This way, you have more control over the conversations you start, but people can still see the entire conversation. Here’s what we learned during our tests: People mostly hide replies they think are irrelevant, off-topic, or annoying. The option is a new way to shut out noise; 85% of the people who hide replies are not using block or mute. People were curious to see how public figures like those in politics and journalism would use this update. So far, they aren't hiding replies very often. In Canada, 27% of people who had their Tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future. Also, they thought it was a helpful way to manage what they saw, similar to muted keywords. We learned that you may want to take further action after you hide a reply, so now we’ll check to see if you want to also block the replier. Some people mentioned that they didn’t want to hide replies due to fear of retaliation as the icon remains visible. We’ll continue to get feedback on this. These are early findings and we look forward to continued learning as the feature is used by more people. Looking ahead, we’re working on new controls and more clarity around the rules of conversation spaces. Soon, we’ll be launching a new hide replies endpoint so developers can build additional conversation management tools. We're exploring more options around who can reply to or see specific conversations, and are testing engagement changes to see if these lead to healthier discussions. We're committed to making sure people feel safe and comfortable talking on Twitter. The option to hide replies is rolling out globally on iOS, Android, Twitter Lite, and twitter.com.

That’s why we routinely disclose datasets of information operations we can reliably link to state actors. These datasets live in our public archive of state-backed information operations – the largest of its kind in the industry. First launched in October 2018, the archive has been accessed by thousands of researchers from around the world, who in turn have conducted independent, third-party investigations of their own. State-backed information operations originating in Saudi Arabia Today, we are sharing comprehensive data about 5,929 accounts which we have removed for violating our platform manipulation policies. Rigorous investigations by our Site Integrity team have allowed us to attribute these accounts to a significant state-backed information operation on Twitter originating in Saudi Arabia. These accounts represent the core portion of a larger network of more than 88,000 accounts engaged in spammy behaviour across a wide range of topics. We have permanently suspended all of these accounts from the service. In order to protect the privacy of potentially compromised accounts repurposed to engage in platform manipulation, and in response to researcher feedback requesting that we pre-filter unrelated spam, we have not disclosed data for all 88,000 accounts. In the interest of offering meaningful transparency, the dataset we are disclosing includes a representative, random sample of the fake and spammy accounts associated with this broader network. We have also shared information about this activity with our peer companies to enable investigations of related activity on their services, and the relevant law enforcement entities. Here are some additional distinct features of the accounts we’re disclosing today: Our internal analysis shows the network was involved in various forms of platform manipulation, targeting discussions related to Saudi Arabia and advancing their geopolitical interests on the world stage. Primarily, accounts were amplifying messages favourable to Saudi authorities, mainly through inauthentic engagement tactics such as aggressive liking, Retweeting and replying. While the majority of the content from this network was in Arabic, a portion of it related to events relevant to Western audiences, including amplification of discussion around sanctions in Iran and appearances by Saudi government officials in Western media. Our investigations have traced the source of the coordinated activity to Smaat, a social media marketing and management company based in Saudi Arabia. Our in-house technical indicators show that Smaat appears to have created, purchased, and/or managed these accounts on behalf of — but not necessarily with the knowledge of — their clients. We have permanently suspended Smaat’s access to our service as a result, as well as the Twitter accounts of Smaat’s senior executives. Smaat managed a range of Twitter accounts for high-profile individuals, as well as many government departments in Saudi Arabia. Many of the accounts involved in the overall network employed third-party automated tools in order to amplify non-political content at high volumes. As a general matter, the use of automation to Tweet helpful content — like crisis response info or weather updates — is not a violation of our rules. However, this behaviour was, in part, strategically employed in an attempt to mask the overall platform manipulation originating from these accounts. These tactics made it more difficult for observers to identify political Tweets in the timelines of accounts, which mostly shared automated, non-political content. What’s next We exist to serve the public conversation around the world. To this end, we’ll continue to take strong enforcement action against any state-backed information campaigns which undermine our company’s mission, principles, and policies. For more information on the processes and principles behind this work, see here."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/info-ops-disclosure-data-september-2019","date":"2019-01-19T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data","Government","Health","Research","Safety","Company"],"title":"Disclosing new data to our archive of information operations","text":"In October 2018, we disclosed the first comprehensive archive of state-backed information operations on Twitter. We launched this initiative to empower academic and public understanding of these coordinated campaigns around the world, and to empower independent, third-party scrutiny of these tactics on our platform. As our investigations of platform manipulation around the world have continued, we subsequently added new datasets in January, June and August, while also sharing insights on Twitter’s internal investigative approach and how these complex, sometimes cross-jurisdictional operations are identified. Nearly one year on, the archive is now the largest of its kind in the industry. Thousands of researchers have made use of these datasets that contain millions of individual Tweets and more than one terabyte of media. Using our archive, these researchers have conducted their own investigations and shared their insights and independent analyses with the world. Transparency and openness are deep-seated values at the heart of Twitter which define and guide our methodology around these disclosures. Today, we are disclosing six additional datasets covering five separate jurisdictions. Per our policies on platform manipulation, we have permanently suspended all the below accounts from the service. United Arab Emirates & Egypt We have removed a network of 271 accounts originating in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt. These accounts were interconnected in their goals and tactics: a multi-faceted information operation primarily targeting Qatar, and other countries such as Iran. It also amplified messaging supportive of the Saudi government. We also found evidence that these accounts were created and managed by DotDev, a private technology company operating in the UAE and Egypt. We have permanently suspended DotDev, and all accounts associated with them, from our service. Additionally, we suspended a separate group of 4,248 accounts operating uniquely from the UAE, mainly directed at Qatar and Yemen. These accounts were often employing false personae and tweeting about regional issues, such as the Yemeni Civil War and the Houthi Movement. Our investigations also detected a small group of six accounts linked to Saudi Arabia’s state-run media apparatus which were engaged in coordinated efforts to amplify messaging that was beneficial to the Saudi government. While active, the accounts in this set presented themselves as independent journalistic outlets while tweeting narratives favourable to the Saudi government. Separately, we have also permanently suspended the Twitter account of Saud al-Qahtani for violations of our platform manipulation policies. This account is not included in the archives disclosed today. We continue to suspend a range of accounts for other types of political spam violations in Saudi Arabia. As ever, we will disclose any attribution we can reliably make to state actors if and when we learn them. Spain We have removed 259 accounts we identified as falsely boosting public sentiment online in Spain. Operated by Partido Popular, these accounts were active for a relatively short period, and consisted primarily of fake accounts engaging in spamming or retweet behaviour to increase engagement. Earlier in the summer, we removed a network of 1,019 accounts in Ecuador tied to the PAIS Alliance political party. The network, composed largely of fake accounts, was primarily engaged in spreading content about President Moreno’s administration, focusing on issues concerning Ecuadorian laws on freedom of speech, government censorship, and technology. Tactics most commonly used were hashtag manipulation and retweet spam. China (PRC)/Hong Kong In August, we disclosed that we had identified a network of more than 200,000 fake accounts based in the PRC which were attempting to sow discord about the protest movement in Hong Kong. Today, we are publishing additional datasets relating to 4,301 accounts which were most active in this information operation to further public awareness and understanding. Next steps Going forward, we will continue to enhance and refine our approach to disclosing state-affiliated information operations on our service. For example, we intend to more routinely disclose data relating to state-backed information operations on the service using our @TwitterSafety handle and in future iterations of the Twitter Transparency Report. We will share more on these plans soon. We see this as a necessary and vital step to regularize our transparency work in this area, and to encourage more third-party investigation of these behaviors online.

With this test, we want to understand how conversations on Twitter change if the person who starts a conversation can hide replies. Based on our research and surveys we conducted, we saw a lot of positive trends during our initial test in Canada, including: People mostly hide replies that they think are irrelevant, abusive or unintelligible. Those who used the tool thought it was a helpful way to control what they saw, similar to when keywords are muted. We saw that people were more likely to reconsider their interactions when their tweet was hidden: 27% of people who had their tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future. People were concerned hiding someone’s reply could be misunderstood and potentially lead to confusion or frustration. As a result, now if you tap to hide a Tweet, we’ll check in with you to see if you want to also block that account. These are positive and heartening results: the feature helped people have better conversations, and was a useful tool against replies that deterred from the person’s original intent.

You would probably agree: It’s a lot harder to get value from social insights if you don’t have a clear sense of the conversations your customers are having with each other, as well as with you and other brands on social. We live in a time where people are generating and accessing an extraordinary amount of data, both real-time and historical. What makes Twitter’s social data so unique is that it reflects the public conversations happening in real-time. And what makes Twitter audiences so unique is that they’re made up of influencers who drive public conversation. They are receptive, relevant and looking for new experiences with a discovery mindset—not just a lean-back-and-entertain-me mindset. That’s why Twitter is investing in new ways of understanding behind conversations and delivering meaningful data about the hundreds of millions of Tweets shared on Twitter every day. When you think about the size and breadth of the conversation on Twitter, it’s essentially the world’s largest focus group-- of present and historical data. Research shows 79% of Twitter users follow brands and 53% recommend products and services to friends and family. Listening to what consumers are saying can surface unique opportunities that extend beyond marketing, into customer service, sales and even product innovation. And for a brand, this allows them to provide a better customer experience, avert issues that could have a negative impact, and get valuable insights to help deliver products and services that better meet consumer needs. Diana Helander, head of marketing for the Twitter Developer Platform, chatted with Marketing Disrupted podcast hosts Brent Chaters and Amber Mac about the importance of social listening, and the role of Twitter Data in helping marketers solve problems. “It’s important for brands to start listening,” Helander says in the Marketing Disrupted podcast episode Brands On-Line: Marketing, Tech and Social Media. “Brands can help identify something newsworthy, or if needed, remediate an issue. But that’s just a first step. Following on from that is active engagement with those audiences, whether it’s for brand voice, marketing campaigns or customer service—engaging in that conversation and doing so in an authentic way.” By listening first, brands can then analyze conversations and social mentions. This can provide a better understanding of what consumers are talking about, doing or buying, which is where solutions like trend analysis come into play. In the podcast, Helander shares some case-study examples of how Twitter Official Partners have used social listening to drive big results and how they’ve used social insights to find fun ways to engage their audiences. For example, she discusses how Sprinklr, a Twitter Official Partner, helped Chick-fil-A use artificial intelligence to spot signs of food-borne illness from social media posts with 78% accuracy, and how social listening helped NASA spot a gap in its content strategy and successfully engage new audiences. Check out Diana Helander’s full interview about Twitter Data’s role in marketing on the Marketing Disrupted podcast, episode 3: \"Brands On-Line: Marketing, Tech and Social Media.” Helander’s portion starts at the 29:09 mark, just after McDonald's Canada VP and CTO Lara Skripitsky."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2019/guest-post-five-ways-brands-build-connections-on-social","date":"2019-01-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Guest post: Five ways brands build connections on social","text":"People today crave connection, especially in our digital world. Brands have long been household names, but with a strong social media presence, they can now occupy an even more personal place in our lives. With so much noise it can be difficult for brands to build genuine relationships with their target audiences. For the brands that clear this hurdle, the payoff is real. When those connections are established, brands are rewarded with a boost in customer loyalty and spending and word-of-mouth recommendations—all direct contributions to their bottom line. Sprout Social data shows that 57% of people will increase their spend with a brand when they feel connected to it. To narrow in on that perspective, 62% of the people on Twitter don’t hesitate to spend more money for the products or services of a brand they like (compared to 51% of the general online population). Putting customers and their wants at the center of your digital strategy is vital if you want to foster long-lasting relationships. We’ve highlighted five things brands must do to better connect with their audiences and turn casual followers into engaged brand advocates. 1. Treat Twitter as the core customer experience element it is. In an environment with so much potential for meaningful relationships, there are big expectations: 78% of consumers want brands to use social to help people connect with each other. Businesses can no longer ignore the value of digital. Outdated excuses (i.e. that it is too difficult to quantify success and that it does not affect the bottom line) are no longer valid today. Twitter is transforming how customers and brands talk to one another, making it an integral part of the consumer experience. Companies like Apple, for example, have their own support handles specifically for handling customer service requests and answering product questions. 2. Use a mix of entertaining and educational content to attract followers. While many want the content they come across to entertain, your content strategy has to strike a balance between showing what your brand offers and what your brand represents. 57% of people on Twitter will favor brands that share their values, compared to just 45% of the general online population. Well-executed educational content can make people feel good about your product and confident about choosing you over competitors. Half of consumers follow a brand on social to learn about new products and services. That said, people still want to be engaged and entertained before they buy. 50% of social marketers say entertaining and inspirational posts are the most effective in helping them reach their goals. 3. Utilize formats like live video to engage with your audience. Video has reigned as the digital content king over the past few years. But despite the push for video, marketers are still behind when it comes to nurturing their video presence, resulting in missed opportunities to connect with consumers. With 45% of consumers wanting to see more live video from brands, marketers should invest in video for sustained future growth. Cultivating communities also offers brands a unique opportunity to connect directly with their audiences. More than two-thirds of consumers will join a private group because they want to connect with people who are similar to them, while almost half (46%) join to communicate directly with a brand or business. The larger the landscape becomes, the more private communities can help brands stay in close contact with their customers. 4. Create posts offering trials or discounts to convert followers into customers. A good deal never gets old. Of consumers that follow brands on social but don’t buy from them, 61% said posts offering discounts or free trials encourage them to make their first purchase. Promotional content is one of the few cut-and-dried ways businesses quantify social performance as it relates to sales goals and ensure a boost in customer loyalty. Brands can take advantage of holidays like Black Friday or Cyber Monday to offer exclusive discounts that get buyers excited. Space Camp USA, for example, created Tweets highlighting a limited-time promotion for Black Friday shoppers. 5. Leverage authentic advocacy to grab your audience’s attention. When marketers take the time to build authentic consumer relationships, they are rewarded with an increase in web traffic, a boost in sales and—one of a brand’s greatest organic marketing tools—word-of-mouth advocacy. One way to move consumers to action is to leverage employee advocacy, a strategy currently employed by 72% of all social marketers. When brands encourage employees to share content to their own networks, 45% of consumers say they are more likely to research that product or service. Starbucks, for example, has a unique employee advocacy program that encourages staff members to share brand updates and news on Twitter. These advantages make it easy to see why more brands are embracing the employee advocacy as a business priority. Moving toward a social-first customer experience In an era where consumers seek meaningful experiences with brands and are drawn to authentic conversations, a business with no social presence is one with no future. People crave connection with their favorite brands, and Twitter provide consumers with a direct line of communication. Social is the perfect place to start meaningful relationships with customers. It’s an environment that’s intimate, where we celebrate the ability to share and connect with one another. As a brand, make everything you deliver there count.

International organizations like @UNICEF are using Twitter to connect with their communities, build relationships, spark conversation and drive actions. To mark UN International Day of Friendship on July 30, UNICEF challenged the younger members of its community to celebrate friendship through acts of kindness both on Twitter and in real life. This effort was part of UNICEF’s #ENDviolence campaign. In December last year, young people from around the world drafted the #ENDviolence Youth Manifesto. In it, they shared what they want from their parents, teachers, policymakers and each other to feel safe and supported in and around school — and kindness stood out as one of the most powerful means to prevent bullying. To help get the word out, UNICEF partnered with high-profile supporters and K-pop sensation @BTS_twt. The Korean pop group invited their more than 21 million followers to get in on the kindness action by leaving a kind note for someone online or in person. For UNICEF, partnering with BTS was a perfect fit, “They are a powerful driving force for positive change and credible young advocates for our work,” says Paloma Escudero, Director of Global Communication at UNICEF. “BTS’ passion, authenticity, and personal stories have inspired young people around the world to take action and recognize their own power to end violence in and around schools. Through our #ENDviolence LOVE MYSELF partnership, BTS has galvanized young people to spread love and kindness,” says Escudero. UNICEF used two hashtags as a part of their call to action. #ENDviolence and #FriendshipDay collectively generated almost 1.5M mentions over seven days according to Twitter Official data partner Brandwatch. The conversation was overwhelmingly positive. Ending violence and “friendship” were widely supported and recognized on Twitter. The table below shows the overwhelming positive conversation that resulting from this campaign. To calculate sentiment, Brandwatch employs a rules-based process around context and keywords to train their software. Brandwatch identified the top 100 emojis used from the day’s conversation. One emoji, in particular, is an important symbol to BTS ARMY fans. The purple heart was the most used in the conversation at more than 700,000 times. For BTS fans, this emoji aptly symbolizes love, trust, and being there for one another as explained by BTS member Kim Taehyung. UNICEF’s message of kindness and friendship was amplified by their partner accounts @bts_love_myself and @bts_bighit. The activation resonated strongly with the values of their audience on Twitter. UNICEF’s approach aligned with Gen Z users who respond positively to calls to action and who care for social justice. More broadly, we know that people on Twitter care about what’s happening in the world and they want brands to stand for something. UNICEF took a conversational approach and encouraged dialogue on Twitter. They empowered their followers with assets to create their own content so that allies and influencers could participate and amplify the message on #FriendshipDay. Escudero explains, “Each and every part of the activation was driven by young people. It was important for us to continue following their lead and create a call-to-action and creative that was simple, accessible and most importantly tapped into their existing online behaviours. The series of ‘kind note’ templates did just that and were based on a format that is popular amongst this demographic on social media.” Twitter helps individuals and organizations connect with each other in real-time. That interaction is made even more impactful when it is positive and driving action towards a common goal."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/inclusion-and-diversity-report-september-2019","date":"2019-01-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Diversity","Company"],"title":"Inclusion & Diversity Report September 2019","text":"This quarterly report highlights areas where we’re making progress in building a more diverse and inclusive Twitter, and where more focus is needed: We’ve made progress increasing representation of women, black, and Latinx talent. This work is always ongoing and as we increase I&D investments we will be particularly focused on retention. Our approach to recruiting diverse technical talent is showing early signs of impact. Moving forward, we’ll double down on these programs and extend them to other parts of the business. Diversity in our leadership ranks remains a gap, and while that gap is getting smaller, it’s critical to make progress here. We’re implementing new initiatives focused on senior roles and expect to have more to report at year’s end. We presented this report to our Board on September 12, 2019, and because we’re committed to working in the open, we’re sharing it with you here. The Data In 2017, we set two-year diversity targets for women, black, and Latinx representation at Twitter. Here’s how we’re doing: We’ve increased representation of women, black, and Latinx Tweeps, having already met our two-year goal for black representation. We will continue to invest in recruitment programs and increase our focus on retention across all three groups. At the macro level we’re trending in the right direction, increasing Latinx and black leadership representation. Since our May report, we’ve seen decreases in representation of women and black leaders, driven primarily by attrition. This is an important focus area for us and we will formalize targets for diverse representation in leadership and technical roles (below) in 2020. We’ve slightly increased representation of women, black, and Latinx employees in technical roles, driven by increased diversity recruitment efforts. Recently, we also launched a hiring tour to bring even more diverse talent into technical roles. We look forward to sharing the results in Q4. Hiring is a critical driver of our progress. In the most recent quarter, our hiring of women slowed slightly, while it increased among black and Latinx employees. New hire results below are expressed as a percentage of total new hires between August 2018 and August 2019. Attrition data tells us how we’re doing retaining employees, including diverse talent. Below are the attrition rates for women, black, and Latinx talent, which are similar or below the company-wide attrition rate. While a good sign, we will continue to monitor and focus on retention. An updated snapshot of race and ethnicity in the US is below: In our May I&D report, we provided an overview of our internal diversity dashboards. We recently expanded the functionality so that Tweeps can drill down further into orgs, see trends in representation across the business, and filter by leader and office location. We are committed to sharing diversity data with our people because we know deep transparency builds trust and drives change. Accountability We recently rolled out a new I&D Health Check-Up program, a monthly customized report for each member of our leadership team, or “Staff.” These check-ups help keep I&D top of mind by giving leaders a more detailed view on hiring, attrition, and promotions for women, black, and Latinx employees across their org. They also provide a tool for business support functions (e.g., recruiters, HRBPs) to tailor efforts for each org and accelerate progress. Hiring & Promos Diversifying Leadership We want our Tweeps to see themselves reflected in our leadership. That’s why in Q3, we’re launching an initiative to require diverse candidate slates for all senior roles (L8 and above). The program requires that at least one female (worldwide) and one black or Latinx (US) qualified candidate be considered by the interview panel. We will share results from this initiative in Q2 of next year. Recruiting Diverse Technical Talent We play an important role in growing the pipeline of diverse technical talent. That’s why we’re investing in next-generation technical leaders from nontraditional backgrounds (coding bootcamps, self-taught coders, veterans, caregivers returning to the workforce, etc.) and those underrepresented in tech (women, black, Latinx, Native American). In July, we launched our first Engineering Apprenticeship Program, a one-year rotation initially focused on people from nontraditional computer science backgrounds. Upon completion of the program, graduates will transition into one of our engineering teams. Our first cohort arrives in Q4. We’re committed to working out the kinks as we learn and grow so the program may reach its full potential in 2020. We are also pursuing a decentralized workforce strategy as a way of expanding our reach to tap into more diverse talent pools. So we’ve launched a hiring tour for technical roles, currently focused on six cities outside of San Francisco. Interviewing is hard enough, so we’re offering qualified applicants airfare, hotel stays — and even onsite childcare — for those who need it. This initial effort is focused on three skill sets (Backend/Systems, Full Stack, and Mobile) but we may expand to more roles and cities if it proves successful. Promotions We review promotions annually. In our most recent analysis, we found that the makeup of employees promoted from January 2018 to December 2018 generally tracked to our demographic population during that time frame. Female employees (global): 40.9% of promotions* Black employees (US): 3.3% of promotions Latinx employees (US): 3.7% of promotions *Promotions are defined by moving from one grade level to the next. Based on these results, we know we can do better. We’re focused on addressing promotion of black and Latinx employees, particularly in entry-level technical roles where we’re launching an onboarding program for new grads. We are also evaluating opportunities to formally integrate I&D into the promotion decision-making process. Scaling a Global I&D Team We are scaling our I&D team! In July, we hired a new global leader, James Loduca (@JamesLoduca), who is building a team with an eye to all of the ways we want to embed I&D across core business functions. We are also hiring a leader based in Asia Pacific to ensure that our I&D function has a truly global perspective as we scale. Learning & Development Our goal is to embed I&D throughout our learning and development programs. This summer, we conducted “Words Matter” workshops at offices around the globe to empower our Tweeps with inclusive language skills to guide their daily interactions with each other. Here are a few things happening in Q4: We are launching weekly workshops as part of an expansion of our Q2 global pilot focused on Healthy Conversations. We are focused on empowering our Tweeps to have healthy conversations around the tough issues that can surface everyday and put health at the center of our culture. We are also hosting our fourth cohort of WELead, our leadership program for emerging female talent, and launching our first Global Female Leaders Program in partnership with Stanford University. Moving forward, we’re building out a portfolio of learning and development that we can deploy at scale on topics like Unconscious Bias, Inclusive Hiring, and Inclusive Leadership. We hope to have these programs in place by the first half of next year. Connecting with our Tweeps Tweeps play a critical and active role in building an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Here are some Q2 highlights. Flock Talk The health of our employees is our top priority. That’s why in August we launched Flock Talk, a program that builds on past efforts for Tweeps to come together during difficult times to share what’s going on with them, find community, and be heard by our leaders. This session was focused on hearing from Latinx Tweeps and allies in the wake of a series of events targeting Latinx people in the United States. More than 150 Tweeps from across the US and Mexico participated in the first session. The program coincides with the formation of an internal working group to meet regularly and review opportunities to better protect and promote diverse voices across our company and service. #TweepTour Our leaders were on the road this summer visiting Twitter offices in Atlanta, Madrid, Paris, London, Hamburg, Dublin, Dubai, Bangalore, and New York to hear directly from our Tweeps. Their feedback revealed opportunities to better resource our BRGs and make them truly global, empower all Tweeps with tools to be allies, and create inspirational moments for Tweeps to create a more diverse and inclusive Twitter around the world. We’re already working to address what we heard! Business Resource Groups Our BRGs are the foundation of our inclusion efforts at Twitter. To ensure they have the resources and support they need to be successful on a global scale, we are implementing these enhancements: Expanded global leadership structure implemented across all BRGs New strategic planning and budgeting process aligned with company’s annual planning Dedicated resources throughout the business to support BRG efforts Annual strategic leadership summit to meet with leadership, share best practices across groups, and celebrate success In September, we celebrate Latinx voices around the world (corresponding with Hispanic Heritage Month in the US). We’re also excited to launch our latest BRG, Twitter Able (@TwitterAble), for Tweeps with disabilities and their allies. Here are some of the amazing things that our BRGs made possible in Q2: Twitter Alas (@TwitterAlas) deepened its partnership with Techqueria, a nonprofit serving the largest community of Latinx people in tech. Together, we hosted events in New York and San Francisco to learn from Latinx leaders, network with peers, and deepen the connection between great Latinx talent and our company. Twitter Asians (@TwitterAsians) hosted an event bringing the Asian tech community together in Cambridge and celebrated the release of “Blinded by the Light” with a cast Q&A and advanced screenings for members in New York and San Francisco. Blackbirds (@Blackbirds) launched the Blackbirds Ambassador program to expand Blackbirds leadership and support to more Twitter offices around the world. This program empowers ambassadors to locally grow Blackbirds with a dedicated budget, resources, and communication channels. Twitter Open (@TwitterOpen) conducted 40+ global events, site activations, and digital campaigns for Pride. To highlight the diversity and intersectionality of its community, Twitter Open co-hosted events around the world with Blackbirds, Twitter Alas, Twitter Asians, and Twitter Women, and marched in the Dublin and London Pride parades. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots (#Stonewall50), Twitter Open produced a campaign spotlighting powerful voices in the LGBTQ+ community to emphasize the power of being seen and heard. It culminated in a large-scale digital out-of-home activation in Times Square for World Pride in NYC and in San Francisco during its Pride parade. #SeeUsHearUs Twitter Stripes (@TwitterStripes) is growing a partnership with Merging Vets and Players, an organization that supports former combat veterans and professional athletes “after the uniform comes off.” Stripes is also partnering with Student Vets of America in an effort to align veteran talent on college campuses with our University Recruiting efforts. Twitter Women (@TwitterWomen) hosted seven events with 200+ attendees. Highlights include an “Own Your Own Story” workshop with Olivia Christian on crafting an authentic and compelling personal brand story, and fireside chats in New York and Dublin with authors Lydia Fenet and Jean Case, and Insaff El Hassini, founder of Lean In France, respectively. Product & Partnerships Building a Diverse Supply Chain As we launched this program, much of our work has focused on understanding our current spend with diverse suppliers, the resources that buyers need to be successful, and the unique value Twitter can bring to diverse suppliers and our community partners. We developed program objectives for 2019 and beyond focused on: Connecting qualified diverse-owned businesses with Twitter Establishing strategies that help suppliers better compete for Twitter business Setting near and long-term diverse supplier spend goals Developing accurate and timely diverse spend reporting Promoting Twitter’s commitment to Supplier Inclusion In Q4, we are launching a Supplier Development virtual workshop for diverse suppliers entitled “How to Do Business With Twitter” and hosting “A Night of Networking” event in collaboration with Twitter Women, bringing together women-owned businesses and Twitter. Investing in Communities Our I&D efforts extend beyond our workforce to include underrepresented voices on our service, and the communities where our Tweeps work and live. This quarter we hosted a new event series of #TwitterVoices to build trust and elevate diverse voices on the platform. Some highlights include: In Cannes, we celebrated black and brown creators with a cameo by The McKinley Clover Steppers, a group of young black women from the South Bronx who use traditional step dance to advance equality. In Detroit, 40 powerful voices came together to discuss investment in the city, review Twitter’s decentralized hiring strategy, and explore opportunities for partnership. We also launched 10 days of virtual #TweetUps in 40 locations around the world to connect people across difference and distance. As part of the activation, we hosted #TweetUps for black #TwitterVoices in Detroit to share a meal with Afro-Brazilians in Sao Paulo. Black voices in Harlem dined with Nigerians in Lagos, and Latinx voices in LA convened across the table with Afro-Latino people in Honduras. These powerful connections and conversations enabled underrepresented communities to share what's happening in their world and discover what's happening in someone else's. On the five-year anniversary of the Ferguson tragedy, we met with activists who were active on the platform during the protests after the death of Michael Brown. This gave the activists a moment to sit down with Jack Dorsey (@Jack) and Twitter leadership to talk about activism on the platform moving forward, and ways to invest in the greater community. #TwitterforGood It is important to us to help people with barriers to employment find work that’s meaningful to them and open pathways to careers in tech for underrepresented minorities. In San Francisco, this year we have invested $1.6 million in local partners, donated 340+ computers to groups like Dev/Mission, Code Tenderloin and Hack the Hood, and hosted 4,800+ people at the Twitter NeighborNest (@NeighborNest), a center that lets homeless or low-income residents access technology, education, and training. We also conducted 85+ volunteer projects across 26 offices, spanning the entire globe on #TwitterforGood Day. We worked with 1,300+ volunteers who provided 3,800 hours of service in close partnership with 80 community-based organizations. What’s Next? Phew! That was a lot –– and we’re just getting warmed up. Thanks to all of our Tweeps who helped drive progress this quarter, and to all of you for coming along for the ride and sharing your feedback. We’re excited for all the opportunities ahead. See you back here for our year-end report, and until then — see you on Twitter!"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/events/2019/how-e3-played-out-on-twitter","date":"2019-01-17T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Data","Sports","Events"],"title":"How #E32019 played out on Twitter","text":"The gaming community around the world came to Twitter last week to chat about all of the exciting announcements, reveals and happenings from the annual E3 expo (@E3) in Los Angeles.

But it’s when you start putting that social data to work to make better decisions, that you know that you have moved from social media management to social intelligence. That transition has been the focus of many conversations I’ve had with businesses during the past year, including a couple of social listening roundtables we’ve hosted here at Twitter. Here’s my summary of what those businesses are telling me: As previously mentioned, more companies are seeing Twitter and other social data as a valuable source of insight into the people and topics important to them. Businesses are realizing the uniqueness of social media in providing real-time, unprompted and authentic feedback and are starting to overlay this ‘voice of the customer’ data with other data sources to find correlation and causation. Companies are in the midst of massive rollouts of dashboards and alerting capabilities to support the specific needs of various departments and regions. At the same time, analysis capabilities are being more centralized to support specialization and reduce duplication of effort. Social listening and analytics tools are supporting the former while business intelligence tools the latter. And to that point… Some innovative organizations are applying their own models for text analysis to more accurately understand all this unstructured data. For this reason, they are either connecting directly to social APIs themselves or are using their social listening provider’s APIs to get social data into their business intelligence tools for further, deeper data analysis. When taken as a whole, the sheer quantity of social data points can be impressive but quantity is not necessarily a requirement for success. Many companies are deriving immense value in surfacing small numbers (hundreds or even dozens) of highly relevant data points on very specific topics. For example, an analyst researching a topic such as yogurt might only find a couple of hundred mentions in a given month, but within that data set are valuable insights around flavor preferences, health benefits or usage trends. Most organizations aren’t asking if social data like that from Twitter has value but when they should be utilizing it. Put another way, what questions is Twitter good at answering? How does social media data complement other data sources and/or research techniques? The answers might vary depending on industry, audience, and/or geography, but many organizations I’ve spoken with are getting immense value from social data at the beginning of their research, using it to understand market context and quickly (and cheaply) test assumptions. Innovation has primarily been driven by social listening vendors over the past decade, however, we are starting to see some really interesting and innovative work coming from smaller digital agencies and data science shops connecting the social dots with other data sources. As mentioned, it’s this blending of data sources which will prove the value of social data for new use cases. As 2019 draws to a close and we look toward a new decade, what is the current state of social intelligence? To paraphrase Churchill, this is certainly not the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. And this stage should excite us.

We exceeded some targets for workforce representation, but fell short of others and need to do better. The momentum we’ve gained recruiting diverse technical talent is encouraging — we must now extend that progress to senior roles, where more focus is needed. As we approach a new decade, we’re excited to take a new approach to how we measure the diversity of our global workforce, set bold targets, and share our progress. In the meantime, we presented this report to our Board on December 12, 2019, and because we’re committed to working in the open, we’re sharing it with you here. The Data In 2017, we set two-year diversity targets for women, Black, and Latinx representation at Twitter. So where are we today? We’re on a journey with no finish line and progress can never be fast enough. Over the last two years we’ve made progress — exceeding representation targets in some areas (Black) and falling short in others (women and Latinx). Next year, we’re introducing a new vision for what we want our workforce to look like in five years, and a career pathways program that will help increase representation of women, Black, and Latinx Tweeps across all levels, roles, and office locations. Hiring is a critical driver of our progress. In the most recent quarter, we hired more women, Black, and Latinx talent compared to the previous quarter. However, we need to double down here to keep pace with overall hiring at the company, which has accelerated. Below are the attrition rates for women, Black, and Latinx talent, which continue to be at or below the company-wide attrition rate. While this is encouraging data, we are determined to lower attrition across these groups even further, and will be investing heavily in 2020. Beyond these three demographics, we continue to track and support deeper representation across our workforce. Here are the broader breakdowns: The true measure of diversity is more complex than what can be gathered from formal People systems. That’s why we’ve launched an anonymous internal Global Inclusion Survey to collect more robust information about our Tweeps’ lived experiences. The survey explores important topics across gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity and immigration, socio-economic status, and religion — to name a few. This data will guide our future I&D investments and we look forward to sharing the results in a future report. Hiring We’ve doubled down on our presence at industry conferences popular with talent from diverse communities. This fall, we had our strongest presence yet at AdWeek, Women Impact Tech, AdColor, National Black MBA, Grace Hopper Conference, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Conference, AfroTech, and Women in Product. Our Talent Acquisition teams continue to cultivate leads from these events with a focus on hiring interns, new grads, and senior-level talent. We also made two critical hires to continue growing our I&D team. Preet Grewal (@preet_oG) is the new Head of Inclusion & Diversity for Asia Pacific who will share responsibility for Europe and Latin America and help ensure that our work maintains a truly global perspective as we scale. Donna Wright (@DJtheHRLady) is our new Head of Diversity Talent Acquisition and will lead our work to embed inclusive hiring principles throughout the hiring progress. Learning & Development In August, we rolled out a new e-learning module to help Tweeps better understand what micro-aggressions are, how to avoid them, and what to do when they occur. As a complement, we’ve taken the show on the road and hosted in-person trainings for teams that want to dive deeper. In November, we launched mandatory unconscious bias training for all Tweeps. These trainings equip learners to recognize and address the effects of unconscious bias by challenging assumptions; encouraging diversity of experience, opinion, and expression; and supporting a workplace culture that actively and intentionally strives to be more inclusive. #LoveWhereYouWork #TweepTour Our leaders wrapped up their world tour of our 30+ offices with visits to our spaces in Sydney, Sacramento, Miami, San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Washington DC, and their last “stop” — time with fully remote workers in a host of locations across the world. We're more confident than ever before that decentralization is the future of work and will enable anyone, anywhere to work for Twitter. A decentralized workforce also exposes us to a variety of perspectives, increased global impact, and will help us naturally unlock a truly diverse and inclusive company that reflects the reality of our service. We’re excited to put all that we’ve heard throughout the #TweepTour into action in the coming months! Business Resource Groups In October, we hosted the inaugural @TwitterTogether Leadership Summit — two days to celebrate and empower the 45 leaders of our global Business Resource Groups (BRGs), gathering representatives from 10 offices around the world. Highlights included strategic planning for 2020, quality time with staff, skill-building workshops, inspirational keynotes from MJ Rodriguez (@MjRodriguez7) and Nabela Noor (@Nabela), and giving back with San Francisco AIDS Foundation (@SFAIDSFound) and #TwitterForGood. Here’s what our BRGs have been up to: Twitter Able (@TwitterAble) teamed up with Twitter Parents (@TwitterParents) to host a Lunch & Learn helping parents and caregivers cope with issues related to child mental health and learning disabilities. We also recognized International Day of People with Disabilities by featuring guest chefs with disabilities. Twitter Alas (@TwitterAlas) celebrated Latinx Tweeps around the world in conjunction with Hispanic Heritage Month, hosting events geared toward education, allyship, networking, and community service in Chicago, San Francisco, New York, DC, Boulder, and Los Angeles. This exciting month culminated with a professional development empowerment workshop hosted by LatinaVIDA (@SavvyLatinaInfo) and a Día de los Muertos celebration in Mexico City, streamed across all global offices. Twitter Asians (@TwitterAsians) celebrated Diwali with cultural events across nine offices in the North American and Asian-Pacific regions, featuring henna artists, performers, light and candle displays, and guest chefs. We also hosted a panel where Asian leaders at Twitter shared their experiences overcoming immigration challenges, which was streamed globally. Blackbirds (@Blackbirds) partnered with our Talent Acquisition teams to deliver an unforgettable experience to attendees at AfroTech (@AfroTech), including inspirational remarks from Dantley Davis (@dantley), Twitter head of product design. We also hosted events celebrating Black History Month in London (below) and Black Consciousness Day in São Paulo. Twitter Open (@TwitterOpen) uplifted the LGBTQIA community by recognizing #SpiritDay, #TransAwarenessWeek, #TransDayofRemembrance, and deepening partnerships with The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender (#LGBT) Community Center (@LGBTCenterNYC) and the Human Rights Campaign (@HRC). Twitter Stripes (@TwitterStripes) hosted 22 Puship Challenges in New York and San Francisco to raise awareness for Suicide Prevention and partnered with Student Veterans of America (@studentvets) to host a career workshop in DC. Twitter Parents (@TwitterParents) co-hosted #TrickorTweet activations for parents around the US to bring their kids to the office and celebrate Halloween. We also hosted the first ever Bring Your Parents to Work Day in San Francisco so parents could experience their children’s work experience. Twitter Women (@TwitterWomen) hosted the cast of Charlie’s Angels (@CharliesAngels) for an empowering and inspirational Q&A, invited women business owners in partnership with our Supplier Diversity Program, joined forces with other Tech companies to launch #ConnectedWomenTokyo, and hosted deep conversations toward professional development in San Francisco, Singapore, and Tokyo. Product & Partnerships #TwitterTeamUp In October, we launched a new internal effort to identify opportunities to better protect and promote diverse voices across our company and service. #TwitterTeamUp is a cross-functional effort led by our Inclusion & Diversity team in partnership with our Business Resource Groups, User Services, Health, and Trust & Safety. The collaboration has opened new lines of communication across leaders who play an important role in shaping how the company thinks about these issues. We look forward to sharing progress in a future update. #TwitterVoices In October, we hosted 30 Latinx and Afro-Latinx #TwitterVoices in New York to discuss their experience on the platform, Latinidad in the spectrum of society, trust and safety, and more. In November, we convened over 40 Black power voices in São Paulo for a #TwitterVoices “Conversation Sessions” event, as well as hosted a #SheInspiresMe “Ela Me Inspira” dinner to surface issues of Black identity, gender equality and obstacles for Black creators ensuring that our work always maintains a global lens. Insights generated from these conversations are shared cross-functionally across the organization to inform future product and policy considerations. Global Paternity Leave Task Force When all parents have equal access to and take their full family leave, everyone wins. That’s why we’re proud to be part of the Global Paternity Leave Task Force. The effort focuses on changing caregiving norms and driving gender equality by empowering men to take their full paternity leave so the benefits are felt at home, at work, and in society more widely. @TechWomen 2019 Twitter is a proud partner of @TechWomen, which focuses on creating the next generation of women STEM leaders from Africa, Central and South Asia, and the Middle East. As part of a five-week program, we recently hosted five emerging leaders, sponsored a community celebration, and sent a delegation to DC who spoke at the World Bank and met with Embassy officials to raise awareness of the importance of investing in STEM education for women and girls around the world. Building a Diverse Supply Chain In collaboration with Twitter Women, we hosted an event to bring women entrepreneurs, professionals, community organizations, and Twitter together IRL, and two virtual workshops for diverse suppliers to empower them to do business with us. We also had a presence across a number of events for diverse suppliers including: Women's Business Enterprise National Council 2019 Conference National Minority Supplier Development Council 2019 Conference Accenture Diverse Supplier Development Program Western Regional Minority Supplier Development Council 2019 Multi Industry Expo Western Regional Minority Supplier Development Council - Builders & Tradespeople Construction Day Women's Business Enterprise Council - Pacific - Bold Success Women's Business Enterprise Council - Pacific - EmpowHer Diversity Partnerships In October we hosted New York Times' 1619 Project as part of our Join The Conversation Series to empower more businesses to navigate complex discussions around topics like race in the workplace. We also deepened our work with the National Pan-Hellenic Council to empower more diverse voices across the platform. #TwitterforGood Giving back to our communities is part of our DNA. This quarter we conducted 90+ volunteer projects across 22 offices, spanning the globe on #TwitterforGood Day. We worked with 1,600+ volunteers who provided 4,750 hours of service in close partnership with 80 community-based organizations. In San Francisco, we rolled out our final quarter of cash grants in 2019 totaling $1,630,000 for the year; an 80% increase from 2018. We also invested in a suite of in-kind donations and on-platform ad grants to provide holistic support to our key partners. We partnered with organizations that comprise a comprehensive workforce development pipeline for underrepresented minorities in tech. This work culminated in opening doors to employment at Twitter with the launch of our new Data Science/Engineering apprentice program. What’s Next? As the year winds down, we’ve got our sights set on 2025 and are asking ourselves, what will it take to become the world’s most inclusive and diverse tech company? We’re excited to share our vision with you in our next report. In the meantime, we want to hear from you! What would you like to see from us? Looking forward to the conversation — see you on @Twitter!"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/events/2019/twitter-reveals-first-ever-womens-worldcup-goldentweet-award-winners","date":"2019-01-15T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Events"],"title":"Twitter reveals first ever Women’s World Cup #GoldenTweet award winners","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/worldleaders2019","date":"2019-01-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Company"],"title":"World Leaders on Twitter: principles & approach","text":"There continues to be meaningful public conversation about how we think about Tweets from world leaders on our service. We welcome the conversation and want to share more context on our principles and process for reviewing reported Tweets from these accounts. Context When it comes to the actions of world leaders on Twitter, we recognize that this is largely new ground and unprecedented. We understand the desire for our decisions to be “yes/no” binaries, but it’s not that simple. The actions we take and policies we develop will set precedent around online speech and we owe it to the people we serve to be deliberate and considered in what we do. Our mission is to provide a forum that enables people to be informed and to engage their leaders directly. We also have a responsibility to the people who use Twitter to better explain why we make the decisions we make, which we will do here. Our approach Everything we do starts with an understanding of our purpose and of the service we provide: a place where people can participate in public conversation and get informed about the world around them. We assess reported Tweets from world leaders against the Twitter Rules, which are designed to ensure people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely. We focus on the language of reported Tweets and do not attempt to determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent. Presently, direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules. However, if a Tweet from a world leader does violate the Twitter Rules but there is a clear public interest value to keeping the Tweet on the service, we may place it behind a notice that provides context about the violation and allows people to click through should they wish to see the content. We announced this in June. Enforcement scenarios We want to make it clear today that the accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely. The below areas will result in enforcement action for any account on our service (without consideration of the potential public interest value in allowing the Tweet to remain visible behind a notice): Promotion of terrorism; Clear and direct threats of violence against an individual (context matters: as noted above, direct interactions with fellow public figures and/or commentary on political and foreign policy issues would likely not result in enforcement); Posting private information, such as a home address or non-public personal phone number; Posting or sharing intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent; Engaging in behaviors relating to child sexual exploitation; and Encouraging or promoting self-harm. In other cases involving a world leader, we will err on the side of leaving the content up if there is a clear public interest in doing so. With critical elections and shifting political dynamics around the world, we recognize that we’re operating in an increasingly complex and polarized political culture. These are constantly evolving challenges and we’ll keep our policies and approach under advisement, particularly as we learn more about the relationship between Tweets from world leaders and the potential for offline harm. This post seeks to provide clear insight into how we address content from world leaders on Twitter today, and will serve as our statement on the decisions we make, rather than our teams providing feedback on individual Tweets and decisions. We've also updated our dedicated Help Center page to provide a significantly more detailed breakdown of how we make decisions regarding the use of the public interest notice. Our goal is to enforce our rules judiciously and impartially. In doing so, we aim to provide direct insight into our enforcement decision-making, to serve public conversation, and protect the public’s right to hear from their leaders and to hold them to account."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2019/introducing-a-new-twitter-dot-com","date":"2019-01-14T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Product"],"title":"Introducing a new Twitter.com","text":""},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2019/sproutsocial","date":"2019-01-13T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Guest Post: Q&A on social listening with Sprout Social CMO, Jamie Gilpin","text":"A version of this article was previously published on Adapt by Sprout Social. Social media: For the average consumer, it’s the go-to platform for opinions, the occasional rant and off-the-cuff observations about the world today. For businesses, it’s a powerful medium to dig deeper into what makes their audience tick and how to keep their brands top of mind for future customers. Most brands are already monitoring the conversation on social platforms. A retailer, for example, might use monitoring to immediately respond to customer inquiries or to like and share positive user-generated content. The ability to track direct mentions is great for any business’ engagement strategy—but there’s more opportunity to tap into on social than meets the eye. Where companies stand to benefit the most is when they learn to listen to the conversations on social media at scale. Unlike monitoring, social listening incorporates a lot more data—it’s not only analyzing what people are saying about your brand, but also exploring what they say about your competitors and your industry at large. It’s being able to take a look at the big picture trends that shape conversations and extracting insights to apply to your social strategy and beyond. To learn more about the applications of social listening and why businesses can’t afford to ignore insights drawn from social data, we talked to Twitter’s Head of Marketing for Data and Enterprise Solutions, Diana Helander. DH: In this day and age, with more consumers using social media than ever, social listening is no longer a competitive differentiator—it’s a must-have. Consumers are more empowered than ever before and have higher expectations of positive experiences with brands. Through listening, brands can uncover insights about their products, business, employees, competitors, industry—and more importantly, they can use social listening to learn from and connect with their customers. Ignoring social listening is, in turn, ignoring your customers. DH: While listening is often associated with informing social strategies, the applications of listening insights don’t end there. Social listening offers something other business data does not: real-time, unsolicited customer or audience feedback. This information drives innovation and allows businesses to learn more about their audience as well as their competitors. DH: Today’s executives need to be plugged into the fastest moving news cycle we’ve ever seen—and Twitter is the only way to do that. Whether it’s brand reputation, customer experience, competitive advantage or crisis management, Twitter is what’s happening around the world and is the best way to get a pulse of what’s happening with your customers. Leaders of customer-focused businesses need to empower their teams with social listening tools and strategies if they want to be at the forefront of their industries and make truly data-driven decisions. DH: Because social listening is a way to capture unsolicited customer feedback or audience engagement, its value is broadly applicable. We see brand leaders using listening to not only uncover deep market insights and identify trends, but also perform real-time campaign optimization, make critical decisions regarding product development and new product introductions, as well as identify influencers. Leading companies who invest in social listening can do so much more than simply respond to customer issues. VTWO, a boutique consultancy based in Australia, used social listening to help clients learn more about their target audience and to identify what types of social content sparked the most engagement among consumers. Thanks to listening, VTWO grew one of its client’s Twitter following by 229% and increased the number of Twitter messages received by 356%. DH: There are a couple of reasons why Twitter audiences are so valuable. Twitter reaches hundreds of millions of users around the world and contains insights on specific people, businesses, industries, trends and more. People are on Twitter to discover what’s new, and over two-thirds of Twitter users influence the purchasing decisions of their friends and family. While skeptics might think social applies only to B2C businesses, social data is increasingly being used by B2B companies, particularly when it comes to financial investments. Bloomberg, for example, leverages Twitter social data to help its subscribers identify meaningful and relevant news so they can make better informed investment decisions. DH: While many companies monitor Twitter conversations to identify a problem (like an airline responding to customer complaints about a delayed flight), innovative companies are identifying trends and insights that drive new product development. A packaged goods company, for example, can use Twitter data to reveal changing consumer tastes for new flavors, informing the development and marketing of new beverage offerings. Listening is also about communicating. Companies should be thinking not only about how they’re listening to the conversation but also how they can engage with those conversations on Twitter and through which content formats. A Kantar/Millward Brown study found the Twitter environment was shown to be a strong platform for video retention; a higher proportion of consumers watch video straight through to the end on Twitter than on Facebook or Instagram. DH: There are two big pitfalls we’ve seen far too often. The first is keeping social data siloed, or limiting its application and the opportunity to use that data to support a more holistic view of audiences and customers. A recent Forrester report on social media maturity points to the need for marketers to leverage this data beyond just outbound marketing and consider how it can be used across other parts of their organizations. The second is listening for the sake of listening instead of listening to support existing business goals. Many brands we talk to know they have to ‘listen to social media’ but they fail to set goals beyond just ‘listen’. Successful listening starts with existing business initiatives, like improving customer feedback or managing a PR crisis, and incorporating social insights to support those goals and processes. Helander said it best when describing the significance of listening: “Ignoring social listening is, in turn, ignoring your customers.” Without social listening, it’s difficult (and pretty expensive) for businesses to know how people truly feel about their brand and in turn, they miss out on valuable customer insights that can serve as a competitive advantage. When brands begin to listen—and not just for the sake of listening—they have an opportunity to analyze honest customer feedback and get a real-time pulse on the state of the industry. With the right tools and a little bit of patience, businesses can turn social chit chat into powerful insights to fuel long-term strategies.

Often, it’s a superstar or a jingle that catches your attention. But this year, the brands who are breaking through the noise are communicating heartfelt messages. Sprinklr analyzed brands who received a significant amount of buzz for their marketing this year to find the top 10 campaigns with the happiest reactions on Twitter. Why is this study important? Because emotions drive sales. Research shows that positive emotions toward a brand have a far greater influence on consumer loyalty than trust and other judgments, which are based on a brand’s attributes. The most successful brands listen to their customers on Twitter, learn from them and take these insights to create successful marketing campaigns that elicit a positive emotional response. Sprinklr’s Twitter insights from the top 10 brands that make people happier: 1. Disney - #GalaxysEdge The massive anticipation for Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge themed lands at Disneyland Park and Disney World created positive online buzz with Star Wars fans discussing what to expect when exploring the new galaxy far, far away. So far, mentions of #GalaxysEdge on Twitter are eighty-eight percent positive. The biggest spike in conversation on Twitter happened on May 31st, 2019 with more than 60 thousand people discussing opening day of the Galaxy’s Edge at Disneyland in Anaheim. The next biggest spike was on August 29th with more than 19 thousand people talking about opening day at Disney World on Twitter. The most prevalent positive emotion is celebration - with 34 percent of people posting about celebrating the launch of the #GalaxysEdge. 2. NASA - 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing NASA celebrated the 50th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 Moon mission in July with a live television and Twitter broadcast, events and a major digital campaign. They also launched 3 crew members to the International Space Station on the same day as the anniversary. On Twitter, more than 123,000 people have mentioned #Apollo50th and NASA 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11, and 93 percent of these mentions are positive. NASA’s Twitter account posted one of the most popular tweets on July 17th for world emoji day, which received an overwhelmingly positive response at 78,000 likes. 3. Microsoft - We All Win Microsoft highlighted its commitment to accessible technology that levels the playing field during the Super Bowl with its commercial, “We All Win.” The commercial showed young gamers using the Xbox Adaptive Controller. It was a huge hit on Twitter, receiving a 95 percent positive sentiment, was one of the top 5 most talked about purpose-driven superbowl ads, and was a winner of the #BrandBowl53 for tech. Top positive themes in the discussion around the campaign include love, accessibility, and inclusion. Microsoft’s Tweet launching the campaign on January 31st was one of the most popular Tweets. 4. Nike - Dream Crazier In February, Nike launched a hugely popular commercial called, “Dream Crazier.” According to Nike, the video “shines a spotlight on female athletes who have broken barriers, brought people together through their performance and inspired generations of athletes to chase after their dreams.” Tennis star Serena Williams narrates the ad. Her words generated a powerful reaction – over 85 percent of mentions of “Dream Crazier” on Twitter are positive. 5. McDonald’s - #BeaBrewGooder Sweepstakes This August, McDonald’s launched McCafé It Forward, a three-day, pay-it-forward program designed to spread goodness across the U.S. one cup of coffee at a time. They also announced the McCafé Be A Brew-Gooder Sweepstakes encouraging coffee lovers to recognize those who they think have done good in their world. The campaign has received a 99 percent positive reaction on Twitter so far, with thousands of mentions from McDonald’s fans nominating a friend or family member who has done something good. The major conversation themes about #BeaBrewGooder include love, life, good and friend. 6. adidas - #SheBreaksBarriers In honor of International Women’s Day, adidas launched the “She Breaks Barriers” campaign to push for women’s equality and visibility in sports beyond one day. As part of this campaign, adidas announced its partnership with Twitter on March 7th, 2019 to livestream female high school sports, saying, “because when she is seen, she breaks barriers.” The campaign has received a 94 percent positive reaction. Out of the mentions with an identifiable gender, 47 percent are male. Of course, the biggest burst of mentions was on International Women’s Day on March 8th, 2019. 7. Bosch - #LikeABosch Founded in 1886, Bosch is the perfect example of a company who knows how to continuously reinvent its image – and use humor successfully – for modern times. In January at the tech event CES, Bosch launched their #LikeABosch video , a parody of \"Like a Boss\" by the comedy group The Lonely Island. The video highlights a savvy Internet of Things (IoT) user and is meant to highlight Bosch’s connected products. The campaign has thousands of mentions and 96 percent of them are positive. 8. Dove - #ShowUs Dove partnered with Girlgaze and Getty Images for Project #ShowUs, building the world’s largest stock photo library created by women and non-binary individuals to shatter beauty stereotypes. With these images, Dove hopes to create an inclusive vision of beauty in media and advertising. The campaign has 3,756 Twitter mentions with a more than 90 percent positive reaction. One of the most liked and shared posts is from Shondaland’s Twitter account, the media company behind Grey's Anatomy, Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder. 9. Gillette - #TheBestMenCanBe In January, Gillette launched \"The Best Men Can Be,” a social responsibility advertising campaign to address toxic masculinity and promote organizations that help men achieve their personal best. This was a divisive campaign, yet the majority of mentions were fiercely positive. Top themes and phrases of discussion associated with the campaign included “well done Gillette” and “toxic masculinity.” Gillette’s Tweet from January 14th is one of the most popular Tweets in this campaign. Many celebrities drove a spike in mentions, including actress Melissa Fumero who had a strong positive reaction on Twitter. 10. Coca-Cola - #OrangeVanilla In February, Coca-Cola unveiled its first new flavor of Coke in over a decade: Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla. The summer-themed flavor contributed to over a billion reactions on social media and stronger than expected sales. More than 21,000 people on Twitter mentioned #OrangeVanilla. While a good amount of people weren’t huge fans of the flavor choice, the majority still reacted with happiness. Sprinklr’s data analysis also showed that Atlanta loves Orange Vanilla Coke. Out of every public post that had an identifiable location, the top five cities where people mentioned Orange Vanilla Coke with the most positive sentiment on Twitter include: Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, and Dallas. Another example of Coke making a connection with their fans was on World Kindness Day. Coke reached out on Twitter to find out what #KindnessStartsWith. Twenty Coca-Cola markets activated across the globe around World Kindness Day on Twitter with 6 languages in the creative. Their goal was to spread optimism and joy to others by continuing their work from WKD 2018 to make the internet a kinder, more optimistic place. In 2019, Coca-Cola expanded their message to energize people globally by listening and starting a conversation with consumers about what kindness means to them. Care More Brands like these make their customers happy by listening to them and showing them love. Using customer insights to create memorable campaigns that evoke a strong emotional reaction is the key to a winning strategy. Sprinklr’s analysis of brand campaigns includes Tweets from January 1st 2019 to September 1st, 2019 in 93 languages. The ranking analyzed Fortune 500 companies and government agencies to pull out the top 10 brands, and takes into account the amount of mentions a brand received around its campaign, and how many of those mentions are positive.

We’ve been discussing internally and with the current members how we can make sure the Council best serves the people who use Twitter, and heard feedback that we needed to broaden membership to include a more diverse range of voices and organize members to have deeper conversations. Going forward, the Council will be made up of several groups, each focused on advising us on important issues that contribute to real-world harm. These are difficult areas to discuss, so it’s even more important to ensure these topics have dedicated time and are understood as unique challenges in their own right. In 2020, we will initially set up groups focused on: Safety and online harassment Human and digital rights Child sexual exploitation Suicide prevention and mental health These four groups cover topics that are critical to ensuring people feel safe, and will be a crucial part in helping us learn how we can move faster to address emerging trends and risks. Focusing on these issues will help us more quickly adapt and address new trends and risks to consider. By bringing together a wider and more diverse range of perspectives, we hope to engage in more substantial discussion of these issues. We’ll also set up temporary working groups on other topics that will be better addressed in conversation with organisations that have related expertise, including those who may not already be members of the Council. One such group will work on the issues we face as we broaden our interpretation of dehumanization. What’s Coming Next We’ll share more on how we’ll expand the Council to include experts from more countries and perspectives not yet represented as well as other ways we’ll gather feedback from people, including details of which groups will be participating in the working groups. We are currently talking to existing members and potential new members about this. A lot of what we currently do, such as ongoing meetings with NGOs, activists and other organizations is always part of our process, but we haven’t done enough to share that externally. The feedback and advice we receive from them makes Twitter better and safer. Expect us to communicate more of our thinking moving forward. We’re grateful for the continued support and engagement from our partners around the world and look forward to collaborating with even more groups in the future."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information-ops-on-twitter","date":"2019-01-12T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Policy","Safety","Elections","Company"],"title":"Information operations on Twitter: principles, process, and disclosure","text":"In October 2018, we published the first comprehensive archive of Tweets and media associated with known state-backed information operations on Twitter. Since its launch, thousands of researchers from across the globe have downloaded datasets, which contain more than 30 million Tweets and over 1 terabyte of media, using our archive to conduct their own investigations and to share their insights and independent analysis with the world. Today, we’re adding six additional datasets to our archive, covering coordinated, state-backed activities originating from four jurisdictions. All accounts have been removed from Twitter. We believe that people and organizations with the advantages of institutional power and which consciously abuse our service are not advancing healthy discourse but are actively working to undermine it. By making this data open and accessible, we seek to empower researchers, journalists, governments, and members of the public to deepen their understanding of critical issues impacting the integrity of public conversation online, particularly around elections. This transparency is core to our mission. Today’s disclosures Iran (4,779 accounts) The below account sets all originated in Iran, and we believe all are associated with — or directly backed by — the Iranian government. However, the signals and behaviors of each set were individually different. We’ve broken them down accordingly: Set one (1,666 accounts): We removed more than 1,600 accounts originating in Iran. Cumulatively, these accounts Tweeted nearly 2 million times. They Tweeted global news content, often with an angle that benefited the diplomatic and geostrategic views of the Iranian state. Platform manipulation is a violation of the Twitter Rules. Set two (248 accounts): In addition to the 1,600 accounts listed above, we took action on a second set of more than 200 accounts originating in Iran which were more directly engaged with discussions related to Israel specifically. Set three (2,865 accounts): Recently, we discussed an action to remove more than 2,800 accounts originating in Iran. These accounts employed a range of false personas to target conversations about political and social issues in Iran and globally. Russia (4 accounts) As part of our ongoing investigations into activity connected with the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA), we removed four accounts which we believe are associated with the IRA. These removals are the result of increased information sharing between industry peers and law enforcement. For more on our removal of IRA-specific accounts around the 2016 US Presidential Election, see here. Spain (130 accounts) Earlier this year, we suspended 130 fake accounts originating in Spain. These accounts were directly associated with the Catalan independence movement, specifically Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya. They were primarily engaged in spreading content about the Catalan Referendum. The network includes fake accounts which appear to have been created with the intent to inorganically influence the conversation in politically advantageous ways. Setting up fake accounts is a violation of the Twitter Rules, full stop. Venezuela (33 accounts) In addition to a previously disclosed domestically-focused set, this is the second time we identified accounts originating within Venezuela that were engaging in platform manipulation targeted outside of the country. Today’s disclosure is comprised of 33 additional accounts directly connected with the previous group of 764 accounts (published to the archive in January). While there were initial indications that these accounts were associated with the Russian Internet Research Agency, our further analysis suggests that they were operated by a commercial entity originating in Venezuela. We are sharing further data on this group to update the public on our attribution efforts. We also want to take this opportunity to comprehensively share our principles and process for future disclosures. Below are answers to some of the most common questions we receive regarding our handling of information operations on Twitter. What are our guiding principles in this work? We believe Twitter has a responsibility to protect the integrity of the public conversation — including through the timely disclosure of information about attempts to manipulate Twitter to influence elections and other civic conversations by foreign or domestic state-backed entities. We believe the public and research community are better informed by transparency. How do we do it? Our Site Integrity team is dedicated to identifying and investigating suspected platform manipulation on Twitter, including potential state-backed activity. In partnership with teams across the company, we employ a range of open-source and proprietary signals and tools to identify when attempted coordinated manipulation may be taking place, as well as the actors responsible for it. We also partner closely with governments, law enforcement, and our peer companies to improve our understanding of the actors involved in information operations and develop a holistic strategy for addressing them. How do I access the full archive of content and Tweets? The complete public archive of content and Tweets are available on our dedicated Election Integrity Hub. What is the makeup of the team at Twitter working on these issues? Teams across the company contribute to our research, analysis, and investigation efforts related to information operations. These teams include data scientists, linguists, policy analysts, political scientists, and technical experts in abuse and anti-spam issues. What policies do you enforce and how do you mitigate the risk of suppressing legitimate speech from political parties? Our policies are focused on misleading, deceptive, and spammy behavior, and are specifically intended to differentiate between coordinated manipulative behavior and legitimate speech from individuals and political parties. The policies we enforce most frequently in this context include: Platform manipulation and spam Coordinated activity Fake accounts Attributed activity Distribution of hacked materials Ban evasion We enforce these policies without regard for the specific entities involved. However, as we discuss below, our decision to disclose datasets related to these activities are impacted by our ability to definitively attribute. What are your standards for disclosure? First, as noted above, we only disclose datasets associated with coordinated malicious activity that we are able to reliably associate with state-affiliated actors. For privacy and safety reasons, we do not disclose information about individuals or accounts not affiliated with a state actor. Second, given the challenges of attribution, we require clear, verifiable associations between accounts we identify and state-affiliated actors. While we enforce our rules proactively and at scale, disclosure of datasets requires additional evidence of coordinated, state-backed activity. Finally, we rigorously quality-check the resulting datasets in an attempt to eliminate potential false positives caused by account compromises or analytical error. Mistakes can happen, and we do our best to avoid this at every stage of our investigations. This process takes time. How does Twitter decide when to disclose datasets? Timing varies. If and when we identify malicious activity on Twitter, our first priority is to enforce our rules and remove accounts engaged in attempts to manipulate the public conversation. Following these enforcements, we carry out thorough investigations of the accounts and individuals involved. This analysis can take anywhere from several days to many months — and in some instances, subsequent enforcement actions may allow us to retrospectively attribute activity we enforced against in the past. We only disclose datasets once we have determined attribution, and once all applicable investigations have concluded. We also proactively notify law enforcement, our peers, and other relevant state agencies. Why the focus only on state-affiliated actors? When we have significant evidence to indicate that state-affiliated entities are knowingly trying to manipulate and distort the public conversation, we believe it should be disclosed as a matter of public interest. People and organizations with the advantages of institutional power and which consciously abuse our service are not advancing healthy discourse but are actively working to undermine it. This is a violation of our company principles, policies, and overarching mission to serve the public discourse. You’ve said that you challenge millions of accounts per week for engaging in platform manipulation. Why not disclose information about those? We do. Twice a year, we share information about our actions to detect and prevent platform manipulation and spam in the Twitter Transparency Report. Our goal in disclosing additional datasets related to malicious state-backed activity on Twitter specifically is to enable research that improves the public understanding of information operations. While other forms of platform manipulation and spam may at times be involved in these operations, we do not disclose specific, Tweet-level data about these activities unless they are directly associated by clear, technical indicators to a specific, attributed campaign by a state-actor. We do, however, have a public API that allows researchers to investigate a small subset of Tweets to further public awareness of the conversation on Twitter. What about research I see on Twitter and ‘bots’? Non-peer reviewed research using our public API can often be deeply flawed. We see a lot of commercially-driven and non-peer reviewed research that make sweeping assessments of account behaviors only using public signals, such as location (if cited), account content, how often an account Tweets, and the accounts it follows. To be clear: none of these indicators are sufficient to determine attribution to a state entity definitively. Looking for accounts that look similar to those disclosed as part of our archives is an equally flawed approach, given many of the bad actors mimic legitimate accounts to appear credible. This approach also often wrongly captures legitimate voices who share a particular political viewpoint that one disagrees with. We work with thousands of signals and behaviors to inform our analysis and investigation. Furthermore, none of our preemptive work to challenge accounts for platform manipulation (up to 8-10 million accounts per week) are visible in the small sample available in our public API. Before engaging in this type of research and making these claims, ethical norms should be considered. To do otherwise does not further public knowledge but rather risks deeply undermining trust in public debate and conversation.

That can range from a journalist reporting from the campaign trail, a government office providing voting resources, or a politician sharing their stance on an issue. With just under a year until US Election Day and two months until the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucus, we’re launching two initiatives that will help people find original sources of information on Twitter by clearly identifying political candidates. First, we’re bringing back Election Labels, which we first launched during the 2018 US midterm election. These labels received overwhelmingly positive feedback from voters and candidates, and they played a prominent role in election conversation: In the week before Election Day, people on Twitter saw Labeled accounts approximately 100 million times each day, and 13% of US election conversation on Twitter included a Tweet with an Election Label. Second, starting this week, we’ll start identifying candidates who qualify for the primary ballot for US House, US Senate, and Gubernatorial races with a verified badge. For both primary candidate verification and Election Labels, we are partnering with Ballotpedia, as we did in 2018, to utilize their expertise in identifying the official campaign Twitter accounts of candidates. What are Election Labels? Election Labels provide information about political candidates, like the office they are running for, their state and district number, and contain a small ballot box icon. The Label will appear on the profile page of a candidate’s Twitter account and on every Tweet sent and Retweeted by the candidate’s account, even when embedded on sites off of Twitter. See below how the labels will look: Which candidates will qualify for election labels? Labels will appear on the Twitter accounts of candidates running for US House of Representatives, US Senate, or Governor in the 2020 US election who have qualified for the general election ballot. When will election labels appear? You’ll start seeing Labels appear on applicable candidates’ Twitter accounts once the candidate has qualified for the general election ballot. This will happen on a rolling basis as states have different caucus and election dates, with the first occurring on March 3rd. Which candidates will be verified and when? Starting today, Twitter will begin verifying the campaign Twitter accounts of candidates who have qualified for primary elections for the US House of Representatives, US Senate, and Governor, and have been identified by our research partners at Ballotpedia. Again, this will happen on a rolling basis as states have different filing deadlines. What is Ballotpedia? Twitter is partnering with Ballotpedia, a civic nonprofit organization that publishes nonpartisan information on federal, state, and local politics, to help identify the campaign Twitter accounts of candidates once they qualify for the general election ballot for an applicable office. What’s Next? Stay tuned as we continue to focus on building tools that better enable people to find quality news and have informative conversations on Twitter. # # # UPDATE (effective February 28, 2020): In order to receive a verified badge, candidates who qualify for the primary ballot for US House, US Senate, and Gubernatorial races must: Meet Ballotpedia’s threshold for an official candidate requiring that they register with a federal or state campaign finance agency before the candidate filing deadline and appear on official candidate lists released by government election agencies after the candidate filing deadline (this may require gathering petition signatures and paying a filing fee); Meet certain account requirements before becoming verified, which include having a profile photo, header photo, bio, and website that clearly identify them as a candidate; and Comply with our Twitter Rules and Terms of Service as we have stated on our Help Center page. Attempts to abuse this system diminish the integrity of the conversation on Twitter regarding elections. If a Twitter account engages in, or has engaged in, activity that violates the Twitter Rules, it may be ineligible for verification or subject to enforcement action."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/synthetic_manipulated_media_policy_feedback","date":"2019-01-10T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Policy","Health","Transparency","Company"],"title":"Help us shape our approach to synthetic and manipulated media","text":"When you come to Twitter to see what’s happening in the world, we want you to have context about the content you’re seeing and engaging with. Deliberate attempts to mislead or confuse people through manipulated media undermine the integrity of the conversation. That’s why we recently announced our plan to seek public input on a new rule to address synthetic and manipulated media. We’ve called for public feedback previously because we want to ensure that — as an open service — our rules reflect the voice of the people who use Twitter. We think it’s critical to consider global perspectives, as well as make our content moderation decisions easier to understand. What is synthetic and manipulated media? The Twitter Rules, the service, and its features are always evolving, based on new behavior we see online. We routinely consult with experts and researchers to help us understand new issues like synthetic and manipulated media. Based on these conversations, we propose defining synthetic and manipulated media as any photo, audio, or video that has been significantly altered or fabricated in a way that intends to mislead people or changes its original meaning. These are sometimes referred to as deepfakes or shallowfakes. Here’s a draft of what we’ll do when we see synthetic and manipulated media that purposely tries to mislead or confuse people: Twitter may: place a notice next to Tweets that share synthetic or manipulated media; warn people before they share or like Tweets with synthetic or manipulated media; or add a link – for example, to a news article or Twitter Moment – so that people can read more about why various sources believe the media is synthetic or manipulated. In addition, if a Tweet including synthetic or manipulated media is misleading and could threaten someone's physical safety or lead to other serious harm, we may remove it. We want to hear from you You’ll find here a brief survey, which is available in English, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. For languages not represented here, our team is working closely with local non-governmental organizations and policymakers to ensure their perspectives are represented. If you prefer to Tweet your feedback, we'll be listening there, too. Use the hashtag #TwitterPolicyFeedback. Additionally, if you’d like to partner with us to develop solutions to detect synthetic and manipulated media, fill out this form. The feedback period will close on Wednesday, Nov. 27 at 11:59 p.m. GMT. At that point, we’ll review the input we’ve received, make adjustments, and begin the process of incorporating the policy into the Twitter Rules, as well as train our enforcement teams on how to handle this content. We will make another announcement at least 30 days before the policy goes into effect. We’re committed to serving the public conversation on Twitter and doing our work in an open and transparent manner.

What are people talking about? How do they feel about certain topics, brands or products? Organizations have tried for a long time to uncover these types of insights through traditional research methods like surveys, focus groups and interviews. What if you could take your research to the next level and uncover even deeper insights in real time? Today, an unprecedented number of people - including your customers, prospects, competitors and other stakeholders - are freely sharing their experiences, interests and opinions publicly, in real time, on Twitter. Twitter is the largest, publicly available, searchable archive of human-generated thought ever. It’s the world’s largest focus group. Are you ready to start listening? Tapping into the world’s largest focus group might seem daunting. The good news is that social listening platforms have the expertise, technology and tools to make it easier to get started. But, before choosing a vendor, you’ll need to get clear on your objectives. Are you seeking brand or industry insights? Customer feedback? Crisis monitoring? Something else? And, once you have the data, what type of analysis do you need to perform? Do you want to know how your audience is feeling about a product, service, experience or issue? What about searching images for your brand or your competitor’s logos? Knowing what you want will form the foundation for finding a social listening tool that best meets your needs. When you’re ready to start evaluating vendors, keep the following three factors in mind: Access to the relevant data can be a key differentiator among social listening platforms. It’s critical that you understand how they are procuring their social data and from which sources. Areas to probe: Data sources - From social channels to blogs, reviews, forums, print & TV, there are many sources of data. Which data sources does the vendor support and, of those, which ones will help you achieve your listening goals? Be ready with your own list of sources, geographic focus and topics you want to analyze. Data providers - Is the platform accessing data via third party brokers, direct from the social networks themselves or by ’scraping’ the web? If they are accessing the data directly from the source, inquire if it’s via publicly available APIs, elevated access or a paid licensing agreement. This is important as changes to APIs and/or commercial agreements could impact your data access. Another important and related question is whether the data provided is being sampled or is full fidelity. Is metadata included? Historical data - Looking for insights from the past? If yes, make sure your vendor has that capability. Does the social listening tool provide access to historical data from its various sources? If so, how far back in time, and is this full fidelity or sampled? How long does it take the vendor to access and showcase insights from historical data? At the heart of any social listening social listening tool is text analysis: the techniques used to understand, organize, and apply sentiment and emotion to text. Some things to consider: How is the platform performing text analysis? This is really about a vendor’s accuracy when it comes to annotating your data. Social listening tools have a variety of approaches to this, so spend some time discussing how their approach differs from others. You likely will hear acronyms like NLP, ML and AI - make sure your vendor can break these down in an understandable way. What level of detail is the text analyzed: paragraph, sentence or phrase? At what level is sentiment and emotion applied? Does the vendor guarantee a minimum accuracy, and if so, how is it measured? How is the sentiment scored, and can you override it? What languages are supported? Can they deliver the same accuracy for each language? When it comes to social listening platforms, your experience matters. To choose a vendor who can act as a true partner, helping you to improve your social listening maturity, consider: Industry expertise - Specific industries tend to have their own needs when it comes to social listening. Does the vendor understand and have experience in your industry? Ask for case studies and customer references. Onboarding & customer support - How will they support you to get up and running? Do they provide services to help you build advanced queries and/or validate findings? What SLAs do they offer for customer support? Alerting, reporting & visualizations - Does the social listening tool offer real-time alerts? Do they allow you to create customized alerts and thresholds? When it comes to reporting, does the vendor allow you to easily export charts and graphs? And do they provide display technology for offices and war rooms or command centres? User experience - Can the user interface be navigated by a casual user allowing them to build queries and analyze results? Is a query builder available for those who can’t use boolean logic? When it comes to social listening, you have choices. Get clear on your needs and then carefully evaluate each of the vendors. Need more support?

Marketing blogs are packed to the gills with stories of high-profile brands taking stands on controversial social and cultural issues. While some brands come out on the other side triumphant, with elevated sales and glorious brand alignment, others hope the world will soon forget how they offended the masses with distasteful missteps. The few that succeed can likely thank a healthy mix of luck and calculated risk. Trying to insert your brand into a culture moment while being sensitive to polarizing points of view is no easy task. But by taking purpose-driven stances, brands can offer strength and steadiness during tumultuous times. “In a time of immense turmoil, people are turning to brands as islands of stability.” – Richard Edelman, Chairman, Edelman Consumers want brands that stand for something by taking a position on an issue and having a strong point of view, but that’s not all. Today’s consumers also expect brands to contribute to their quality of life. That’s why successful, purpose-driven brand platforms require more than just good timing. To stand out, brands must identify a purpose and turn to data, insights and social listening to engage in relevant, genuine, open and empathetic conversations. According to a 2019 Sprout Social report, 72% of consumers expect brands to be positive contributors to society and almost half expect brands to act as leaders. An additional 45% of consumers say brands can strengthen their connection with customers by supporting a cause that is personally relevant to them. Major brands like Patagonia, Nike, and Axe have all taken purpose driven stances on widespread cultural concerns, and the role that they play is unique and powerful. Because they each prioritized brand authenticity in the cultural moments they chose to enter, that elusive balance of luck and calculated risk has allowed them to operate as the beacons of strength and steadiness consumers say they want in the brands they trust. When something happens in the world around us, for many of us, our instinct is to pull out our phones and share it with others. It’s the moment when “look at me,” becomes the infinitely more powerful “look at this.” Twitter represents the daily pulse of global conversations and provides the ultimate context for brands to connect with people. People on Twitter are active and driving the conversations that shape culture. It is the largest searchable collection of human thought, and longest-running focus group that’s ever been created. Movements start on Twitter because the community is active and engaged. Outdoor retailer Patagonia set the standard for aligning a values-driven corporate mission with its audiences’ personal values, as evidenced by a decades-long history of supporting environmental causes. When the White House announced a reduction in the size of two national parks in 2017, Patagonia responded almost immediately by turning their website into a call to action. Visitors to the site were greeted with following the message: “The President Stole Your Land. In an illegal move, the president just reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. This is the largest elimination of protected land in American history. Patagonia won’t step down.” Days later, Patagonia took its defiance of the current administration one step further and filed a lawsuit seeking to clarify the Antiquities Act of 1906, which states a sitting president has the power to create national monuments but not reduce them. The brand also put its money where its values are by donating a $10 million tax break it received as a result of policy changes by the current administration to environmental causes. Though there were some calls of “newsjacking” on Twitter in the days after Patagonia’s public opposition, the majority of the response was overwhelmingly positive because the brand was using its considerable platform to raise awareness about an issue its customers were passionate about. And that’s good for business as well as perception: Patagonia—a company with $1 billion in profits in 2018— saw a 7 percent increase in sales the week after their statement. In Patagonia’s case, success came when their actions were deeply grounded in fulfilling their mission statement and lived up to consumer expectations. In 2016, N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the national anthem at a pre-season game in order to raise awareness about racism, police brutality and the oppression of people of color. The next year Kaepernick left the San Francisco 49ers and became a free agent but wasn’t signed by another team. In 2018, Nike made the bold move of partnering with Kaepernick on a campaign about standing up for beliefs, featuring a black-and-white photo of Kaepernick and the powerful message “Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything. #Justdoit.” In 24 hours, the post garnered more Twitter “likes” than former U.S. President Obama’s announcement of his second term, and twice as many views on Twitter than any other platform. Nike won the “Marketer of the Year” title by Ad Age in 2018 for this collaboration. The campaign however, was met with mixed reactions, with some Tweeting pictures of Nike purchases to show their support and others taking to Twitter to share their outrage. It even led to a trend of people setting their shoes on fire and cutting the Nike logo off of their socks. A video of flaming sneakers was viewed 11 million times on Twitter. But despite the polarizing nature of the campaign, Nike’s sales increased by 30 percent and their market-cap grew by nearly $6 billion in just a couple of weeks. Nike was able to take a calculated risk in part because the message aligned with the shared values of the brand and their audience, and it paid off. Patagonia and Nike are both examples of brands with long histories of championing a specific set of values. But what about when a brand that realizes its values are suddenly out of sync with its audience? Axe, maker of men’s grooming products, built its brand based on traditional views of masculinity--namely that one’s value as a man is rooted in your ability to attract women. But by the mid 2010s, public opinion of how masculinity is defined and portrayed had clearly evolved. In 2016, Axe took a pulse check of what was important to its audience of young men and found that perceptions of what it meant to “be a man” were more complex than they may have seemed in the past. Rather than rehashing its “sex sells”-based advertising of old, Axe responded to the cultural evolution with a campaign that put the definition of masculinity squarely in the hands of its audience. The tagline, “Find your magic,” encouraged guys to embrace what made them each unique. This new campaign bucked traditional views of what it means to be a man and instead embraced a wide range of definitions, ultimately encouraging guys to be themselves in order to unlock what is memorable and special about them. In the end, the campaign had 70 percent positive sentiments across Twitter, and resulted in a 15 percent increase in purchase intent. Axe’s campaign worked because it didn’t ask anything of the audience, but rather reflected the audience’s own positive qualities back to them. It was tested and rooted in real cultural shifts and behavior. According to Sprout Social, four out of five consumers believe society is more divided than ever before and they’re looking to brands to reignite connection. Sixty-four percent of consumers want brands to connect with them and just under half (49%) expect brands to bring people together towards a common goal. After years of observing brands who “do purpose well” on Twitter, we’ve discovered this formula as a framework for arriving at a unique brand purpose. Brands should ask: What fuels your business? What values guide your company? How are you showing your commitment in a way that invites others to rally with you? Does your brand have a right or role to be here? Does your company have a history to values that align with this topic? Will this stand up 10 years from now? Are you doing or just saying? Is your brand making a commitment that supports the purpose? Are you showing, not just telling? [SM2] By answering these questions and drilling down to your brand’s true purpose, you can feel confident that your audiences will respond with passion. Patagonia, Nike and Axe all took calculated risks and landed big results. Each clarified its company’s values, understood where those values intersected with what their audience cared about and built experiences that supported those shared touchpoints. The result? Real, deep, authentic connections with customers.

They are driven by data, surfacing insights and measuring but very rarely are they integrated or even sharing with one another. Odds are good that your Marketing department is already using tools to listen, analyze and measure social data. This is backed up by results from a recent Harris Poll* sponsored by Twitter. Marketing leaders polled revealed that 93% of them are using social media in their programs- from tracking their campaigns to measuring brand equity. 74% also reported using social platforms to perform some customer care Over on the CX team, for the most part, if anyone is thinking about social, it’s an afterthought. According to a recent report from Forrester**, most voice of the customer (VoC) programs are still heavily focused on traditional data sources like surveys and missing out on unstructured and unsolicited data like that from social media platforms. Here are 3 big things marketers know about social media data that they need to share with their CX colleagues: While surveys continue to be the bread and butter of CX programs, by their very nature they are limited because they only measure a moment in time. What marketers understand is that customers are also providing a steady stream of feedback in real-time, and in the case of Twitter, that feedback is intentionally public. Throughout the customer journey - people are signalling satisfaction, concerns, frictions, and conflicts through their social posts. They are not only expressing how they feel but why they feel that way. While not to suggest the CX programs aren’t collecting authentic feedback, solicited feedback like that from surveys and focus groups is limited and directed by the questions and topics. Marketers who employ social listening strategies are rich in unsolicited feedback. And, sophisticated marketers understand the nuances between the individual social platforms. For example, Instagram users may post inspirational content and strive to depict their best selves, while over on Twitter, customers are likely to share their unfiltered views on any and every topic - from the mundane to the controversial. Have you ever been blindsided by unintended consequences from the introduction of a new product or service? Or been surprised when a competitor seemed to predict the future and capitalize on a new trend before anyone else? Marketers know that news often breaks first on social platforms and social data is often the bellwether of emerging trends and issues. By listening, they can insert their voice into breaking topics and identify and mitigate issues before they become a crisis. By tapping into social data and combining it with traditional data sources, CX practitioners will find themselves one step closer to a true 360 view of the customer. These real-time and authentic reactions to and experiences with your brand - good, bad and neutral, will empower you to shape experiences for the better and win approval and loyalty of your customers. Are you ready to integrate social data into your CX program? First step - talk to your marketing team. Chances are, they’ve been waiting for your call. Need more support?

With hundreds of millions of global users, Twitter is the perfect place for brands to listen to their customers, learn from them and show them some love. As a recent Vulture article says, “Advertising has always been integrated with culture — mascots brought brands to life, influencers became human billboards — but Twitter has facilitated a new sort of intimacy for brands, one in which they can blend in with people and develop their own personas.” Hashtags are one of the main ways that brands use Twitter to connect with customers. But, how do hashtags become popular? And, how do brands take advantage of viral hashtags? This is the story of #PanteneOppa – a random hashtag from a local radio station that turned Steve Aoki into a brand ambassador for Pantene. It’s a great example of a brand seizing an opportunity to launch an organic marketing campaign, created and driven by the conversation on Twitter. On October 25th 2018, DJ Steve Aoki released “Waste it on Me,” a song featuring the world renowned South Korean boy band BTS. In addition to holding records for best-selling albums, BTS also holds a host of social media records such as most Twitter engagements (average retweets) for a music group, thanks to their huge fan base the BTS Army. In 2018, BTS was ranked as the #1 most Tweeted about account for 2018 worldwide. Only three days later on October 29th, #PanteneOPPA hashtag was born. A local radio station in Tennessee, 103.7 KISS FM, tagged Pantene in a Tweet with a gif of Steve Aoki jumping, saying “Hey @Pantene we have your new spokesperson! Look at that hair bounce 👏🏾 #PanteneOppa.” In Korean, oppa literally means “older brother of a female person,” but the meaning of oppa has changed over time and now commonly refers to a close friend or romantic interest. On October 30th, Pantene responded to launch a new campaign that connected it to a global audience organically. Pantene’s simple Tweet -- “Can we join this party?” received a response from 103.7 KISS FM who mentioned BTS in their Tweet, urging Pantene to collaborate with Steve Aoki and BTS on a commercial. On October 30th, Steve Aoki jumped into the conversation. Steve Aoki’s Tweet accepting the new nickname has more than 45K likes and 20.5K retweets. According to Steve Aoki, who spoke with Sprinklr and Pantene on a panel at the 2019 Twitter Beach, Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, BTS fans are uniquely powerful on Twitter. “They’re definitely young, but they’re incredibly organized and intelligent. If they love you, the power they have is exponential,” said Aoki. On October 31st, Pantene ensured BTS fans stayed involved in the Twitter conversation . The company responded to Steve Aoki’s Tweet with lyrics from the BTS and Steve Aoki new song, “Waste It On Me” with a request for the BTS Army to comment with #PanteneOppa commercial ideas. They also didn’t forget to mention 103.7 KISS FM in their Tweet – a nice call out to the radio station that started this conversation. In response, 103.7 KISS FM encouraged BTS fans to give Pantene some #PanteneOppa ideas. From there, #PanteneOppa was officially a viral hashtag. Sprinklr’s social listening found that Pantene and 103.7 KISS FM Tweets mentioning the BTS Army and Steve Aoki drove the most engagement, leading to a huge spike in #PanteneOppa mentions on October 31st. Thousands of BTS fans responded on Twitter, creating viral #PanteneOppa memes. Throughout the month of November, Pantene strategically kept the #PanteneOPPA conversation going with an engaging poll, hilarious Tweets (one has 16.9K likes so far) and 1-1 Tweets to fans. Pantene didn’t miss out on the opportunity to thank 103.7 KISS FM either and on November 12th the radio station Tweeted a picture of the care package – with a handwritten note, personalized T-shirt and products – that Pantene sent to them for all the positive buzz they created for the brand. This engagement resulted in a spike in Twitter conversations mentioning #PanteneOPPA that’s lasted through 2019. 1. Be Natural on Twitter & Don’t Force Engagement. Throughout Pantene’s entire engagement on Twitter with #PanteneOppa, the company never forced the conversation. Sprinklr’s platform found that only two of the four spikes in hashtag mentions were driven by Tweets from Pantene, meaning that the majority of the brand love was organically created by customers. This is a great example of how to create meaningful connections with customers through a social media campaign inspired by an earned engagement. As with all conversations, over time they die down and the Twitter universe moves to the next hot topic. Pantene allowed the conversation to die down just like it started – naturally. But the connections they made and the brand voice they built remain. 2. Tap into the fandom on Twitter. Pantene knows that the conversation about their brand is happening on Twitter. The company paid attention to the Tweets about Steve Aoki and BTS, and used this moment to effectively participate with those fans with relevant and fun content – like incorporating BTS song lyrics into their Tweets. The tone of their Tweets were like any other fan, excited and wanting to be in on the joke. The @Pantene handle had character and was funny. In only one month – from October 28th to November 28th 2018 – Sprinklr found that more than 20,000 individual BTS fans on Twitter mentioned #PanteneOppa and generated 29,943 mentions of the hashtag #PanteneOppa. Sprinklr’s listening capabilities also found that the sentiment on Twitter around Pantene grew significantly in October 2018 when the #PanteneOppa hashtag went viral. This increase in sentiment can be attributed to the effective Twitter content Pantene published as a result of its deep knowledge of consumers and BTS fans. 3. Listen to Your Customers on Twitter, Learn from Them and Show Them Love. Pantene, Steve Aoki, BTS and 103.7 KISS FM all succeeded in driving engagement around #PanteneOppa because they listened to their customers, quickly engaged with them and also created personalized engagements to one another. 51% of marketers say that access to social data (listening in real-time to conversations your brand otherwise wouldn't be privy to) is very important to overall business decision making. From listening on Twitter, they learned what would make their customers happy. They quickly turned this insight into action and showed their customers and fans some love with personalized Tweets, polls and creative images. They also knew that measurement should be more sophisticated than just looking at “likes” in order to understand the full story. With the right technology like Sprinklr in place, brands can listen and authentically connect with audiences on Twitter to drive deep levels of engagement and make their customers happier.

We create our rules to keep people safe on Twitter, and they continuously evolve to reflect the realities of the world we operate within. Our primary focus is on addressing the risks of offline harm, and research* shows that dehumanizing language increases that risk. As we develop the Twitter Rules in response to changing behaviors and challenges with serving the public conversation, we understand the importance of considering a global perspective and thinking about how policies may impact different communities and cultures. Since 2019, we’ve prioritized feedback from the public, external experts, and our own teams to inform the continued development of our hateful conduct policy. Expanding our hateful conduct policy While we encourage people to express themselves freely on Twitter, abuse, harassment and hateful conduct continue to have no place on our service. As part of our work to make Twitter safe, our hateful conduct policy covers all protected categories. This means that we prohibit language that dehumanizes others on the basis of religion, caste, age, disability, disease, race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation. We will require Tweets like those below to be removed from Twitter when they are reported to us. We will also continue to surface potentially violative content through proactive detection and automation. If an account repeatedly breaks the Twitter Rules, we may temporarily lock or suspend the account; more on our range of enforcement options here. The Twitter Rules help set expectations for everyone on the service and are updated to keep up with evolving online behaviors, speech, and experiences we observe. In addition to applying our iterative and research-driven approach to the expansion of the Twitter Rules, we’ve reviewed and incorporated public feedback to ensure we consider a wide range of perspectives. With each update to this policy, we’ve sought to expand our understanding of cultural nuances and ensure we are able to enforce our rules consistently. We’ve benefited from feedback from various communities and cultures who use Twitter around the globe. Consistent feedback we’ve received includes: Clearer language — Across languages, people believed the proposed change could be improved by providing more details, examples of violations, and explanations for when and how context is considered. We incorporated this feedback when refining this rule, and also made sure that we provided additional detail and clarity across all our rules. Narrow down what’s considered — Respondents said that “identifiable groups” was too broad, and they should be allowed to engage with political groups, hate groups, and other non-marginalized groups with this type of language. Many people wanted to “call out hate groups in any way, any time, without fear.” In other instances, people wanted to be able to refer to fans, friends, and followers in endearing terms, such as “kittens” and “monsters.” Consistent enforcement — Many people raised concerns about our ability to enforce our rules fairly and consistently, so we developed a longer, more in-depth training process with our teams to make sure they were better prepared when reviewing a report. That said, even with these improvements, we recognize we will still make mistakes. We are committed to further strengthening both our enforcement processes and our appeals processes to correct our mistakes and prevent similar ones moving forward. Our trusted partners We realize that we don’t have all the answers, so in addition to public feedback, we work in partnership with our Trust & Safety Council as well as other organizations around the world with deep subject matter expertise in this area. As we’ve expanded this policy, we’ve collaborated with civil society, academics and third-party experts to help us think about how we could appropriately address dehumanizing speech around these complex categories. For example, we've worked with partners to help us better understand the challenges we would face and to ultimately answer questions like: How do we protect conversations people have within marginalized groups, including those using reclaimed terminology? How do we ensure that our range of enforcement actions take context fully into account, reflect the severity of violations, and are necessary and proportionate? How can — or should — we factor in considerations as to whether a given protected group has been historically marginalized and/or is currently being targeted into our evaluation of severity of harm? How do we account for “power dynamics” that can come into play across different groups? \"Our work in local communities helps us think critically about ways to ensure social cohesion between the diverse communities we serve, institutions, and policymakers. As a trusted partner, we worked with Twitter to ensure that cultural and regional nuances relevant to migrant groups were accounted for in their hateful conduct policy update.\" — Roses of Peace, an interfaith organization that aims to build a cohesive and resilient Singapore We’ll continue to build Twitter for the global community it serves and ensure your voices help shape our rules and how we work.

People on Twitter aren’t observing passively; they’re generating significant cultural movements in real-time. This is why it’s so important for brands to listen to what people are talking about on the platform. Now, more than ever, businesses must track relevant conversations, influencers, competitors, customer feedback, social engagement, and crisis management. Two brands at the forefront of building relationships on Twitter are NASA and Nationwide. They use Twitter in unique ways to better understand what their fans are interested in, and use that information to generate tailored content that strengthens their brand voice. Through Twitter, the two organizations talking directly to passionate fans – and build authentic connections in the process. @NASA has over 30 million followers on Twitter, but the organization has also galvanized its audience by sharing content across 500 social accounts aimed at niche communities, including the @NASA_Astronauts handle which accounts for individual astronauts, space stations, and missions. These niche accounts offer behind-the-scenes looks at agency initiatives and streamline content to the followers who are most receptive to it. Engaging different audiences across multiple accounts requires a serious listening strategy. And while tapping into Twitter insights and actively listening to different audiences can uncover positive feedback and praise, it can also expose areas where people feel underserved. After auditing its Twitter audience using insights from Sprinklr, a comprehensive social suite, NASA realized that while its fans enjoyed stunning photos of space and behind-the-scenes looks into missions, there was a group of people who wanted to know what space sounded like, too. The organization’s in-depth Twitter listening sparked an idea about, well, listening. To meet the demand, NASA incorporated space audio clips into its social media content strategy, highlighting the ominous galactic soundscapes in Tweets and giving certain followers the experiences they were missing. The sounds topped the intergalactic charts, with promotional tweets drawing up to 6,000 likes and many of the recordings themselves receiving well over a million plays on SoundCloud. “Everybody has that little bit of childlike wonderment in them,” says Jason Townsend, NASA’s deputy social media manager. “If we can find that curiosity in every person out there and pull it out of them, then we can really engage with an audience that is interested in what we’re talking about.” NASA’s Twitter presence exemplifies social media engagement at its best. People follow the accounts to learn, share their own expertise, and interact with other space enthusiasts. NASA uses insights and data to find fun ways to engage its existing audience and reach new frontiers of fans. “At the end of the day, if you’re not measuring what you’re doing, you’re not succeeding at being able to improve, learn from what’s going on, and roll that up into your next actions,” Townsend says. Nationwide is on its customers’ side with an authentic, relatable brand voice that extends to Twitter. Through its Twitter content, the brand is able to convey trust, an especially important priority when interacting with customers who have important questions about their coverage. To show its human side, Nationwide uses Twitter to showcase how it engages with the community beyond insurance, through initiatives like the Nationwide Children’s Hospital network, among others. “A lot of people hear Nationwide and think of insurance…we want to be known for so much more,” says Dace de la Foret, Nationwide’s director of social media. “We want people to know about what we do for the communities where we live and work, and specifically our Foundation’s relationship and support of Nationwide Children’s Hospital.” “Much of the engagement we have with our followers is focused on showing them the connection between Nationwide ‘the business’ and Nationwide ‘the company that is making a difference in people's’ lives,’” he added. “It comes down to a simple question: Who is the audience and what is the best way these messages will resonate with them?” By harnessing Twitter data to drive its philanthropic efforts and listen at scale, Nationwide can create personalized content for its Twitter followers with support from Sprinklr. These social insights also allow Nationwide to look at its diverse audience to identify the micro-influencers, brand ambassadors and patient champions who take to social media to praise the brands’ initiatives. By learning from its Twitter audience, the brand can engage them in conversation or share their Tweets and stories with the rest of the Nationwide community. “Social listening is not just about seeing what people are saying, but seeing what people are asking of you,” says de la Foret. Twitter serves brands invaluable feedback and the opportunity to hear from a range of people and perspectives that inform important business decisions, from what to stand for to when to launch. To make the most of these real-time connections, brands can #startwiththem and include Twitter as a core part of their business model, not just as an ad hoc addition. By listening to what their audiences are saying, brands can build meaningful connections with their customers, and take the right steps to make new ones.

Check out this moment to see highlights from the last four years! Powered by community partners and Twitter volunteers, the NeighborNest’s family-friendly environment helps to foster bright and hopeful futures for all. Since opening our doors in 2015, we've had the pleasure of hosting more than 17,000 visits from residents and community members, and conducting 4,700 hours of programming. This wouldn't have been possible without the commitment and support of over 15 partner organizations and 1,600 hours of service from Twitter volunteers. “I personally am so proud of the facility and program that we have created and thrilled that this resource is available and welcoming for the homeless and at-risk families we serve, helping them to bridge the very real digital divide in a supportive and encouraging environment.” -- Erica Kisch, Executive Director, Compass Family Services “The NeighborNest is such a well-conceived and executed contribution to helping families move out of poverty and homelessness. This place and program has many threads of meaningful impact. We are proud to be a part of it!” -- Laurie Sanchez, Program Director, Community Technology Network “Every other month, the Nest has hosted our cohorts in an on-site tech visit. These visits create hope and support increased self-esteem because they are engaged with dignity and respect” -- Program Director, Code Tenderloin Our work at the Nest is centered around three core values: learn, connect, and grow. Whether connecting individuals with services at the Nest or learning directly from them through their life experiences, the relationships we foster every day allow us to grow in ways we could only imagine.

Nico is learning about coding – and working as part of a group. These are valuable lessons he will use throughout his life! We are very thankful!” -- Mother of Nico, Catholic Charities Client The NeighborNest gives Twitter volunteers the opportunity to experience the Tenderloin, Mid-Market and South of Market Area from the perspective of our neighbors. While it’s incredibly important to understand the community’s history, the strength of its residents and the everyday struggles, humanizing those experiences through connection is what we pride ourselves on. Sometimes, just being able to create a warm and welcoming space, invest time in relationships, and provide hands-on assistance makes all the difference. “Volunteering at the Nest keeps me grounded and connected with the community where I work. It's a great opportunity to give back, and I've learned that a little time and effort can go a long way.” -- Jerrel Peterson, Twitter Volunteer, Trust & Safety “Volunteering at the Nest helps me think empathetically about users in our community and thus makes me a better, more intuitive engineer. It reminds me that I am blessed and helping others if a gift I give myself.” -- Greg Wright, Twitter Volunteer, Revenue Operations “It was incredible to see the joy on the children's faces and the sense of community amongst the moms, dads, and caretakers. As a mom, I know how important it is to build a strong community for your children and for yourself as a mom, and the Nest provides that welcoming, warm environment to foster relationships for the local families.” -- Elaine Wolfe, Twitter Volunteer, Real Estate & Workplace “Volunteering and meeting people around the community has made me feel way more connected with the people. When you walk around the Tenderloin, you only notice the people on the streets, you don't see the people in the shelters, or the families, or the kids in school.\" -- John Speck, Twitter Volunteer, Technical Program Management Our partnerships with leading nonprofits in the Bay Area have helped the NeighborNest emerge as a collaborative and diverse space which offers a variety of skills-based training and family-oriented programs, but often end up creating connections and fostering a support system amongst clients and volunteers. Through great work with our partners, we were honored to receive the Mutual of America Community Partnership Award, alongside Compass Family Services. When we made the decision to open this community space, we knew we could not do it alone. Not only did we want to provide relevant programs that filled a need, we also wanted to partner with industry experts to provide the best experience for our clients. Our nonprofit partners have been instrumental in doing just that. Their support has allowed us to make the biggest impact on the lives of those around us, each and every day. As we celebrate our fourth birthday, we are thrilled to continue expanding our impact in the community with the renewal of our five-year lease. Here’s to continued partnerships and creating new possibilities through technology literacy and a love of learning!"},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/rules-refresh","date":"2019-01-06T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Health","Safety","Company"],"title":"Making our rules easier to understand","text":"Our rules exist to help keep everyone using Twitter safe and ensure they can participate freely in the public conversation.

We’ve also added detail around other policies, including election integrity, platform manipulation and spam. What’s new? We’ve gone from about 2,500 words to under 600. In 280 characters or less, each rule clearly describes exactly what is not allowed on Twitter. New categories — safety, privacy, and authenticity — mean our rules are organized thematically, so you can find the information you’re looking for more quickly.

From focus groups to behavioral analytics to neuroscience techniques – today’s research professionals wield a wide array of techniques and tools - from the simple to the more sophisticated - all to better understand people and their behaviour as consumers. Couple this with the power of big data analytics, and you might think the picture of today’s consumer is all but complete. And yet, is there a single business who can confidently say that they really know their customers on an emotional level? It turns out that we humans are emotional beings and, not surprisingly, that emotionality extends to consumer decision-making. As author and Harvard scholar Gerald Zaltman asserts, 95% of decisions are made in the emotional domain1. Taken one step further, consider the System 1 and System 2 theory posited by noted psychologists Kahneman and Tversky which echoes Zaltman – the first impulse is always emotional and comes from our reptile brain, which then gets processed (or not) by the rational neocortex. What that means for our understanding of the customer is that without intercepting that first impulse, we can’t be sure we’re capturing the real intent; that raw, unfiltered, unprocessed response. It’s not that we haven’t tried. Whether through focus groups or surveys, we ask customers to share their feelings and motivations about our products and services, as well as their purchase and post-purchase experience. But this approach to analyzing customer experience is limited. Because it’s done in a way that encourages filtered, rationally processed and controlled retrospective responses, the moment is lost and with it the emotion. So, how best to fulfil your quest for the holy grail of emotion? The key is to capture unprompted reactions in the moment. While tapping directly into a consumer’s brain is unrealistic, not to mention unethical, there is one place where consumers are freely sharing their emotions, unprompted, in the moment. Every minute of every day, people around the world are sharing their thoughts, experiences and opinions as they happen on Twitter. More often than not, emotion is part of the mix. When they’re feeling something about your brand or product, those emotions often convert into action. Eileen had the best stay at your resort? Her friends take note and may visit. Kenny’s child wasn’t treated well at a drama camp? Other parents are now on alert. Diana found the interviewing experience at your company odd? Other potential recruits may opt to give it a pass. By listening to those voices we not only have an unprecedented opportunity to engage directly with our customers and react quickly, we can take it a step further by identifying insights that bring us closer than ever to understanding them on an emotional level. This deeper understanding can be put to work shaping better customer experiences my making emotional connections and ultimately driving greater customer satisfaction and brand affinity. With traditional research, it may take some time and effort to understand how your customers really feel. With Twitter, you don’t need to ask the question – you’ll know before your surveys, focus groups or sales data tell you. Your customers are talking. Are you ready to start listening?

That’s why twice a year, thousands of our employees participate in various charity, philanthropic, and community-based projects as part of our #TwitterForGood global initiatives. Our latest #TwitterForGood Day took place in November and saw 1,600 Twitter employees commit more than 4,740 hours of service in 22 cities around the world. From Dubai to Dublin and Sydney to Sao Paulo, volunteers served meals, taught STEM skills to school children, cleaned parks, and much more! Check out how Twitter employees around the world spent the day by scrolling down for updates! Sydney Twitter Australia (@TwitterAU) prepared meals in partnership with Our Big Kitchen (@OurBigKitchen), a community-run, industrial kitchen in the heart of Sydney. Through food rescue programs like SecondBite and Foodbank, OBK minimises food waste by turning fresh produce into a home cooked meal. By providing a place where people from all walks of life can connect through doing good, volunteers spent the afternoon with the OBK team to prepare and cook meals for distribution to shelters across the state, which support families in need.

The conversation took place on Twitter’s Q&A VIT app, where questions were asked and discussed both offline and online. The hashtag #AskDocG was used to drive conversation around this important discussion. There were approximately 50 people in attendance for #TwitterForGood day, including NGO partners, the public, and Twitter employees. This event was a great opportunity to highlight the launch of #ThereIsHelp, a notification service on Twitter which provides valuable mental health resources to vulnerable people, and encourages them to reach out and get help when they need it. Seoul Twitter Korea (@TwitterKorea) partnered with the Hansol Social Welfare Center (@hansolwf) to provide meal services to senior citizens, embodying the #TwitterForGood spirit in the holiday season.

Team Korea delivered a total of 100 lunch boxes and served 200 special meals to the elderly. Major shout out to the dishwasher team of five Twitter volunteers that spared no effort in ensuring the smooth running of the kitchen! Singapore Twitter Singapore (@TwitterSG) kick started #TwitterforGood Day at Food Bank Singapore’s warehouse. Twitter employees helped with stocktaking, packing and storing of food donations received by Food Bank Singapore. Food Bank Singapore’s mission is to bridge the gap in the market by collecting surplus food in the market and providing it to people and organizations in need of food. Twitter Singapore also partnered with Roses of Peace (@rosesofpeace), a youth-driven organization that fosters a culture of interfaith appreciation in Singapore by building bridges between diverse communities.

Twitter volunteers visited the office of Rebit (@Re_Bit) and helped assemble their teaching materials’ kit on diversity focusing on LGBTQ issues for elementary school pupils and junior high school students on 22 November. While volunteering, Twitter volunteers were also able to learn about LGBTQ issues, which was certainly a valuable experience for them. Additionally, on December 6th, approximately a third of Japanese employees participated in the most popular community clean-up activity with Chuo Ward (@chuo_city). India @TwitterIndia partnered with LetMeBreathe (@LetMeBreathe_In) to build floating wetlands, an eco-friendly and cost-effective method to clean one of the oldest bodies of water, Hauz Khas Lake in Delhi that dates back to the 14th century. India Tweeps came together to create two wetlands or islands from scratch using recycled bottles and coir that are designed to function as a self-sustaining ecosystem and clean the lake by soaking-up all the pollutants. Named as Tweet and Retweet, the islands will not only support revival of the lake but also function as a habitat for migratory birds. Twitter Dublin (@TwitterDublin) employees put their pedals to the metal on #TwitterForGood Day as they kicked off a 600km #CycleForGood, travelling the equivalent of the distance from Malin Head to Mizen Head (the length of Ireland), to raise funds for the housing and homelessness charity Peter McVerry Trust (@PMVTrust). Employees in Dublin set a fundraising target of €10,000 for the #HomesForGood campaign by the end of 2019, with the funds going towards support services for those who have recently been housed by theTrust. They raised a whopping €11,181 in total so far. The office activities were included in radio broadcasts around the country spreading the #TwitterForGood message.

Seattle Forty-three Twitter volunteers from our Seattle office partnered with Food Lifeline (@FoodLifeLine) and Mary’s Place (@MarysPlaceWA) as part of our #TwitterForGood activity this year. Food Lifeline’s mission is to feed people experiencing hunger today and work to end hunger for tomorrow, so volunteers from Twitter joined a Volunteer Group onsite at the organisation. Six volunteers from the Seattle office traveled to the Food Lifeline facility and helped sort, categorize, and package food products to be distributed to various food banks in the Greater Seattle Area, while 30 employees based at the Twitter Seattle office, helped package meal kits to be donated to Food Lifeline that will be distributed among local food banks to families in need. The mission for Mary’s Place is to provide safe, inclusive shelter and services that support women, children & families on their journey out of homelessness. Keeping that in mind, four Seattle volunteers undertook an online monetary fundraiser to supply the new Marketplace & Family Diversion Center created by Mary’s Place. Donations were needed to help supply shelves, bins, and hooks to set up the facility. Four other volunteers then set up an off-site volunteer group to help set up the new Marketplace & Family Diversion Center created by Mary’s Place, where families in need can get all of their essentials like clothing and home items.

Dubai On December 9, the @TwitterMENA team will award the winner of last summer’s #YouthForGood competition that was launched by @Jack and Minister of State for Youth Affairs in the UAE Her Excellency Shamma Al Mazrui (@Shamma). The initiative invited youth based in the UAE to use the power of Twitter by creating an account that would fuel philanthropic efforts in their community. The winning account, @Youth_ImprintAE, was created by a team that partners with restaurants to provide discounted meals on a monthly basis for those with limited access to meat-based meals. They also took the initiative to collect donations from the public, and distribute the meals in various locations around Abu Dhabi, providing over 500 meals in less than 3 months. Twitter employees will join the @Youth_ImprintAE team this year and will head to a construction site in Dubai to distribute the meals to those working at the location."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2019/guest-post-forbes-data-driven-twitter-strategy","date":"2019-01-04T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Insights"],"title":"Guest Post: Emily Drewry discusses Forbes’ data-driven Twitter strategy","text":"Forbes, a global publisher with a focus on business news, is constantly reinventing itself to meet the demands of modern media. Amid talks of declining news readership, Forbes had its most profitable year in 2018 since it became Forbes Media in 2006. Playing a major role in Forbes’ success story is their focus on social-first content and personalized engagements with millions of followers across its social channels – particularly on Twitter. I spoke with Emily Drewry, Senior Manager of Social Content at Forbes, for an inside look at Forbes’ approach to creating engaging content and developing a global Twitter strategy. According to Emily, “Twitter for us is like nowhere else.” Check out the full interview below to learn more about how Forbes is creating relevant content for its Twitter audience. Rachel: How many handles does Forbes have, and how do you manage them? Emily: Forbes has more than 30 social media accounts so we really use the calendar in Sprinklr to see what’s coming up and this enables the social team across the world to stay on the same page. The calendar has turned into a communication tool for us, to help us collaborate. My team spends an average of 6 hours per day using Sprinklr, and we estimate our jobs would take an average 5 hours additional per day without the platform. Rachel: What’s your Twitter strategy? Emily: Forbes has many different types of coverage. We are known for longer, in-depth features but we also have a trending news initiative. For breaking news reporters, it’s essential we get their stories out on Twitter as soon as possible. That allows them to be part of the real-time news conversation and reach a crucial, broad audience. Twitter for us is like nowhere else. If you’re not on Twitter when a conversation is happening, it’s a huge opportunity missed. Our editor is scheduling posts throughout the day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We post probably 100 posts a day on Twitter, focusing on the most timely content that comes from Forbes.com. With Sprinklr publishing, we schedule content on Twitter ahead of time for nights and weekends so we can still go home and be normal people. If we need to quickly change the time of the scheduled post or edit the text within it, we don’t have to redo the post in Sprinklr which is a productivity savings— we can just drag and drop the post to the new time and make edits within the platform. News stories are coming in quickly all the time so we often have to reschedule things, and I can’t imagine what it would be like to manually change scheduled Twitter posts every time we wanted to make an edit. Definitely saves us a number of hours a week. Rachel: Can you talk about your video series the #ForbesFlash? Emily: #ForbesFlash started in July 2017, and it’s a regular recap of the biggest stories of the week. What’s important and valuable about it is that I’m not reiterating the stories that everyone has already read. We’re focused on the quality journalism that our reporters have put out for the week. Twitter was the home initially for the #ForbesFlash because I found that our audience didn’t have a visual opportunity to catch up on the most important news of the week. Because of Sprinklr reporting, I know which stories were the most popular for the week so it helps me curate the script for these videos. Rachel: How have you increased the engagement of the content you’re putting out for Forbes across social? Emily: Based on the ability to look at all of our social content comprehensively in Sprinklr, we’ve been able to optimize our social content across platforms for specifically what our audience is interested in seeing. I can use Sprinklr to filter by channels and easily understand that the content that performs best on Twitter might not be what performs best on Facebook or LinkedIn. So we’re using the real-time engagement metrics and click-through rates to help us continuously improve the effectiveness of our content. Rachel: Final thoughts? Emily: Twitter is the platform we publish on the most because it’s great for real-time, breaking news and it’s where our audience spends their time. Twitter is a news aggregator for many people, so it’s important for us to join in as a voice for our readers.

In addition, 84% of executives say that innovation is important to their growth strategy. In a one week period, Twitter logged over 100K appearances of #innovation. It feels like literally EVERYONE is talking about innovation. Electronics companies, fast food chains, insurance providers, airlines - I could go on - they all see innovation as a path forward into the future - whether that future be one of improved customer experiences, greater efficiency, increased profits, continuing relevance or all four. Yet, according to Harvard professor and best-selling author Clayton Christensen, 95% of all product innovations fail. Those are daunting odds. So, what’s a business to do? Many experts assert that the answer partially lies with the customer. Specifically, businesses need to identify the “why” behind customer actions and choices - what need are they trying to meet when they purchase a product or service? What is the context surrounding that decision? That deeper understanding of the customer will surface opportunities to innovate. If you’re a customer experience (CX) professional, this should be great news. Isn’t your whole “raison d’ètre” all about understanding the customer? The question is, how well do you really know your customers? And, to build on that, is your current customer program generating the types of insights that uncover the context critical to discovering opportunities to innovate? Uncovering context is tough. Certainly, traditional voice of the customer (VoC) surveys have served CX professionals well by providing a high-level measurement of their customer’s overall satisfaction as well as identifying ongoing concerns and/or gaps in customer experience. But, because surveys are by their very nature directive, i.e. the company determines the questions and the timing, not to mention they are usually completed after the customer experience in a sterile format, they’re unlikely to be very good at revealing the circumstances and emotions surrounding a customer interaction. On Twitter, people share hundreds of millions of Tweets every day. And, at every stage of the customer journey, through their Tweets, they are signalling satisfaction, concerns, frictions, and yes, context. They are not only expressing how they feel but why they feel that way. And, thanks to social listening tools, you can easily tap into these conversations, uncovering insights in real-time as well as historical patterns. When combined with other more traditional data from sources like surveys or focus groups, that additional context provides a fuller picture of your customers, allowing your business to know them on a deeper level, uncovering hidden opportunities to innovate. Of the six key success factors identified in PWC’s 2018 Global Innovation 1000 study, coming in at number four is “base innovation on direct insights from end-users”. Of course, there are many factors that feed into innovation success, but identifying innovation opportunities that will resonate with your customers is a critical first step. Your customers are talking right now, providing you with the clues and context to identify your next big innovation. Are you ready to start listening?

Today, we’re releasing hundreds of cultural insights from the conversation on Twitter, to inspire and empower brands to develop campaigns on the leading edge of shifts in consumer behavior and beliefs. We tapped into the largest catalog of human thought and conversation – Twitter – to analyze billions of Tweets over the past three years. Using machine learning to remove commonplace topics and fads, we’ve uncovered hundreds of insights, 18 of the fastest-evolving trends and 6 overarching themes. These reflect fundamental shifts in U.S. culture and provide a window into what’s starting to matter more and more to consumers as we enter a new decade. We’ve packaged all of these cultural insights into an immersive website, which we are unveiling today, and created a dedicated “Trend Pack” for each of the 18 trends that dives deep into conversation growth, key drivers, related hashtags, emoji sentiment...and of course, Tweets. And this is only the beginning: We’ll refresh these insights annually and will expand to additional markets in 2020. The Big 6 Well-being: The human desire to live a happy, healthy life continues to be a cultural priority, but the focus has shifted from the outside in. Where body image, diet, and physical appearance once dominated the conversation, a healthy mind and whole-body wellness are starting to take center stage. Trends in this theme: Data-Driven Bodies | Holistic Health | Being Well Together Everyday Wonder: The more people learn about the universe, the more in awe of it they become. They’re fascinated by the cosmos and everything it contains, from the planets themselves, to climate change and extreme weather, to spiritual energy and healing. Trends in this theme: DIY Spirituality | In Awe of Nature | Cosmic Fascination 📣Standout stat: Conversation around spiritual practices that were once considered “New Age” in the US – like yoga, chakras, Zen, and mindfulness – declined 45%. Meanwhile conversation around alternative spirituality – like healing, energy, and astrology in relation to spiritual practices – jumped 168%. Creator Culture: Makers, builders, and entrepreneurs have joined artists, writers, and musicians in the creative arena. They’re actively blurring the lines between work and personal passions, reimagining the day job, and pushing creativity into mainstream culture. Trends in this theme: Creative Currency | Hustle Life | Connecting Through Video 📣Standout stat: Unsigned musician hashtags have increased 113% as unsigned artists use Twitter to get buzz around their talents.

More than 1,330 Twitter employees around the world committed more than 3,350 hours of service to projects such as cleaning up neighborhoods San Francisco, hosting Iftar dinners for young people in Jakarta, revamping a community center in Dublin, and organizing a dance for children with disabilities in Sao Paulo. This day reminds us of the impact service, community and partnership can have. Want to see how Tweeps spent the day? Check out this moment and continue scrolling for a snapshot! APAC Sydney As part of the annual Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea, @TwitterAU hosted a morning tea stall to raise money for Cancer Council Australia (@CancerCouncilOz). The idea behind Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea is simple — bring your friends, colleagues, and community together over some tea and treats to help fund Cancer Council’s life-saving research, prevention, programs, and help support people impacted by cancer. Jakarta In Indonesia, @TwitterID teamed up with Httpool Indonesia (@Httpool) and Young on Top (@YoungOnTop) to organize a “YOT Share Ramadhan” event. By sharing Iftar, the breaking of the fast together, Tweeps in Jakarta shared their meal with about 100 children orphans and disadvantaged people around the city of Depok. Other teams participated in games and activities to distract kids as they waited to break their fast. India As a part of our #TwitterForGood efforts, we are continuing to monitor the aftermath of Cyclone Fani and are trying to work with our NGO partners in supporting restoration work in Orissa and other impacted areas. @TwitterIndia celebrated #TwitterForGood Day with a range of activities focused around environmental protection, social awareness and public health, kicking things off with a #TwitterForGood with a ‘City Session on the State of Varanasi Pollution’ in partnership with #LetMeBreathe (@LetMeBreathe_In). Varanasi continues to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. The session looked at multiple approaches that could be adopted in order to deal with the menace of air pollution including reforestation, minimising pollution of the Ganga River, reduced diesel usage, and sewage treatment plants, among others. Seoul Under the theme \"Everyday is #EarthDay,\" @TwitterKorea partnered with the Gangnam District Volunteer Center of Seoul City to conduct activities around the Yangjae Stream that runs through Southern Seoul. After learning about the ecosystem around the Yangjae Stream from local activists, the team spent a day making Effective micro-organism mudballs which provide a good microbial diversity in pond water and belong to the biological water improvement agents (EM Mudballs) Volunteers then threw 500 EM balls into the stream to help clean the water. This was the first time Team Korea participated in an environmental volunteer activity. It was a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate Twitter's commitment to the environment and interact with community leaders at the district level. Singapore @TwitterSG spent the month of May hosting #TwitterForGood activities. This kicked off with the Earth Observatory of Singapore (@EOS_SG), one of @TwitterSG’s emergency response partners - stopping by to share how they have been monitoring earthquakes and volcano eruptions, as well as measuring their impact with the use of Twitter data.

Middle East Dubai @TwitterMENA organized the #TweetRight initiative at the American University of Cairo where students attended digital literacy workshops and created accounts that aim to combat misinformation on the platform. The competition encouraged students to be active and creative while engaging in a powerful dialogue on promoting the health of the public conversation. The winning team received a Twitter Ads For Good reward that will help them continue to develop the knowledge and skill-set needed to fight misinformation and #TweetRight. In the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan and as part of an ongoing effort in community engagements, we participated in the #EmiratiValuesIftar initiative that was announced by HE Shamma Al Mazrui (Minister of Youth Affairs). The idea behind the initiative is for Tweeps to be exposed to Emirati local culture and values by attending a family-hosted Ramadan Iftar at an Emirati home in Dubai and to participate in local Ramadan traditions, reflecting tolerance and engagement with the community. Europe Dublin As a part of its annual volunteer efforts, @TwitterDublin voted to partner with The Peter McVerry Trust (@PMVTrust) for a second year. The Irish Tweeps set a fundraising target of €10,000 by the end of 2019, with the funds going towards support services for those who have recently been re-housed by the Trust. For #TwitterForGood Day, the team kicked off the day by calling over 60 businesses on behalf of PMVT to enable the building of their database.

Germany @TwitterDE partnered with Freiwilligenboerse Hamburg on a garden maintenance project. Freiwilligenboerse Hamburg is a privately funded non-profit organization that informs and accompanies people in all aspects of voluntary work.

Seattle At @TwitterSeattle, Tweeps worked with Food Lifeline (@FoodLifeline) to sort and package food items for distribution to food banks and shelters across Western Washington. The organization aims to feed people who are experiencing hunger today while solving the issue of hunger tomorrow. The Seattle team helped sort and package 16,000+ pounds of food (that translates into about 14,572 meals for our hungry neighbors!) The rest of the office also pitched in by packaging 300 meal kits full of non-perishable food items for the cause.#HungryDoesntHavetoHappen San Francisco @TwitterSF partnered with over 30 organizations around San Francisco to give back to our community. We assembled 7,000 bagged lunches for three homeless service organizations including St. Anthony Foundation (@stanthonysf), The City Eats (@TheCityEats), and FoodRunners San Francisco (@FoodRunnersSF). We cleaned streets, weeded gardens, and renewed and restored natural habitats in parklands around the city with the SF Parks Alliance (@SFParksAlliance), Mission YMCA (@MissionYMCA), and Friends of the Urban Forest (@SFUrbanForester).

People have become desensitized to hearing companies say, “we value your privacy,” and are worn out from being asked to accept privacy policies that they rarely, if ever, even read. Many companies make these declarations without even showing people what actions they are taking to protect their privacy. And let's be honest, we have room for improvement too. We believe companies should be accountable to the people that trust them with their personal information, and responsible not only to protect that information but to explain how they do it. That’s why we’re launching the Twitter Privacy Center to provide more clarity around what we’re doing to protect the information people share with us. It is the central place that host’s everything that’s part of our privacy and data protection work: related initiatives, announcements, new privacy products, and communication about security incidents. It should be easier to find and learn more about the work we’re doing to keep your data secure, including what data we collect, how we use it, and the controls you have. How we think about Privacy and Data Protection at Twitter People’s right to privacy and data protection is something we have fought to protect since Twitter was created in 2006. From the beginning, we have offered a range of ways for people to be part of the conversation on Twitter on their terms – from creating pseudonymous accounts to protect their identity to letting people control who sees their Tweets. But what people see externally is not the sum of our work. Behind the scenes, teams across the company are constantly working to protect your privacy and data. This work has three areas of focus: Fix technical debt. Twitter has changed a lot since the first Tweet was sent almost 14 years ago. As was, and still is, common in fast-growing tech companies, we built new features and services on top of older systems. In some cases, the older systems were never made to support their current uses — that’s technical debt. Tackling technical debt is an ongoing challenge for every company, and we’ve been doing it for years. This work isn't just good for the privacy and safety of people who use Twitter, it's also good for business. It will help us get better products and services to you faster. Also, you may have noticed that we have been communicating more data and security related disclosures over the last two years. Many of those are the direct result of these efforts. We have been working to make sure our systems meet your expectations, and when they don’t or when we have found issues that may require your attention to keep you safe and secure, we have told you about them. We'll continue to do this when something requires your attention. Build privacy into the products we launch. Privacy by design is a priority with every product we build. To achieve this, we continue to build out our processes to review the products we launch. This process involves our Information Security, Product and Privacy Counsel teams, and our independent Office of Data Protection. This is critical work that we’re continuing to invest in. Every new employee goes through data privacy, security, and management training. We launched an internal group called Twitter Doves, which is designed to cultivate the best data privacy, security and management practices for everyone at the company. The Doves’ motto, \"trust is earned, not given,\" guides best practices we adhere to across Twitter. Finally, we're speaking with people around the world to better understand how different cultures and groups think about privacy and what they expect when they share their information with a company like ours. For example, through the initial findings from this research, we’ve learned that “meaningful controls” have different connotations depending on where you’re from. This kind of feedback is critical to us as we build the privacy and data controls people want when they use Twitter. Keep ourselves accountable to the people that trust us with their data. We know that there is no silver bullet that will make people trust us with their data. However, we also know that to keep your trust we have to show you we’re accountable. We have already taken a variety of steps to weave accountability into how we operate. Our Data Protection Officer, Damien Kieran, provides an independent assessment of all privacy and data protection-related work to our board of directors on a quarterly basis to make sure we’re appropriately discussing any issues and concerns we have and to drive alignment on what matters from a data protection perspective. We are continuing to invest in our Data Management Organization so that we can always account for the data we have, how it is used, and when it is shared. To make sure everyone at Twitter is accountable, privacy and data protection is the heart of our 2020 company-wide priority to build products that earn the trust of people who use them. Also, launching the Twitter Privacy Center provides a central place to keep you updated on our privacy and data protection work and aid us in being accountable to you through transparency. Twitter is not perfect at privacy and data protection. But we want you to know our statements are not a cliche but backed by an evolving privacy and data protection program intended to keep your data secure and us accountable."},{"platform":"Twitter","url":"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/our-partnership-with-unhcr","date":"2018-12-31T23:00:00.000Z","tags":["Twitter for Good","#OnlyOnTwitter","Charity","Company"],"title":"Our partnership with UNHCR to launch #KnitForRefugees","text":"We partnered with UNHCR, The UN Refugee Agency and Kniterate to launch a global campaign to proactively and collectively shed light on an important issue facing Syrian and Iraqi internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees in the Middle East North Africa region as winter approaches. Currently around 14 million Syrians and Iraqis are displaced in the region: The needs in the region remain significant. Last year, UNHCR was able to reach 3.6 million Syrian and Iraqi IDPs and refugees with winterization assistance. But urgent funding is needed to ensure that life-saving winterization assistance is in place before freezing temperatures grip the region, exposing tens of thousands of families. For many, this will be the ninth consecutive winter in displacement. UNHCR’s Twitter campaign aims to generate awareness through the power of the service and share a strong call to action by encouraging people to act and make a difference through donations in advance of the winter season. Through a partnership with London-based Kniterate (@Kniterate) the innovative campaign will demonstrate the power of Tweets, as a compact digital knitting machine begins to knit a scarf featuring participating Twitter accounts. The campaign will be rolled out across multiple regions, kicking off in the UAE. UNHCR’s official global account on Twitter @Refugees, Tweeted a video around the cause calling on people to Retweet the Tweet in order to knit the first part of the scarf live on Twitter. The same campaign will be rolled out in several countries in the coming months until winter starts. This partnership with Twitter is really significant for UNHCR. Funds raised through this campaign will support our efforts to provide life-saving interventions to the most vulnerable refugees this winter. Every year we see firsthand the desperation faced by refugees in the region during the winter season. We hope that through this initiative, we will not only raise awareness of the plight of refugees but also raise the necessary funds to ensure that no refugee is left out in the cold. Ayat El-Dewary UNHCR Officer in Charge in the UAE Concluding on 30 November 2019, the results of the campaign will be shared during the Global Summit of Refugees in Geneva."}]
